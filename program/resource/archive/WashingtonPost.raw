Trump made right call in firing Flynn, White House says In the wake of a new Pentagon investigation of retired Gen. Michael Flynn receiving payment from foreign governments, the White House said Thursday that President Trump “made the right call at the right time” in firing Mr. Flynn as his national security adviser. White House Sean Spicer said the probe by the Defense Department’s inspector general of Mr. Flynn is “appropriate.” “If they think there’s wrongdoing, then the department’s inspector general should look into that,” Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn as his national security adviser in February after White House officials learned that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during the presidential transition. “I think the president made the right call at the right time,” Mr. Spicer said. The Pentagon’s IG is looking into Mr. Flynn receiving payments from foreign governments and foreign entities after he retired from the Army in 2014, including the RT television network linked to the Russian government. He was advised by the military not to accept such payments. Mr. Spicer also noted that Mr. Flynn received his security clearance renewal during the Obama administration in the spring of 2016, “apparently with knowledge” of his trip to Russia in late 2015. He said he wasn’t accusing the Obama administration of wrongdoing, but added, “I’m just making sure people understand the process and how it works.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

President Trump’s first 100 days have been devastating to environment, say green activists Out of all the groups in the liberal coalition, environmentalists may have had the worst of it during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Leading green activists say President Trump has already done a full term’s worth of damage, rolling back Obama-era regulations and installing one of their chief critics as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The president’s pick to lead the EPA, Scott Pruitt, built his political career by challenging environmental and climate-change regulations while Oklahoma attorney general. Since his confirmation in February, the EPA has already started to dismantle the Clean Power Plan — federal rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants — and a host of other regulations. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt are intent on reversing eight years of EPA policy under the previous administration, transitioning the agency away from its Obama-era focus on climate change and expanding its regulatory reach, toward enforcing existing protections against air and water pollution. Working with Congress, Mr. Trump also has rolled back new authority given to the EPA to regulate small bodies of water across the country. The agency also shelved plans that would’ve required oil-and-gas companies to record and provide to the federal government vast amounts of information about emissions from their drilling sites. In addition, Mr. Trump lifted costly restrictions on coal-mining operations across the country. Mr. Trump also handed environmentalists a stinging defeat by approving the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and by proposing massive budget cuts to the EPA and climate-change programs in other corners of the federal government. Internationally, the administration is weighing whether to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate-change treaty. Just this week, Mr. Trump ordered a review of national monument designations, potentially opening up new federal lands to energy development. All told, environmentalists say the president’s first 100 days have been devastating. They argue that Mr. Trump didn’t tell voters the truth about his intentions. “I would call this an extreme agenda that for someone who didn’t even win a majority of the vote is out of line with the values of the American people,” said Erich Pica, president of the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “He didn’t run on getting rid of the Clean Water Act and making water dirtier. He didn’t run on any of that, yet that’s what his extreme agenda is doing right now.” Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said this week that “the hallmark of the president’s first 100 days” has been a relentless “assault on our climate, environment and national heritage.” On the heels of the executive order reviewing national monuments, other environmental activists accused the president of using his first months in office to sell out the country to the fossil fuel industry. “Leave it to Trump to take aim at an American tradition and principle that is beloved across political affiliations — our public lands, waters, and monuments. Trump wants to carve up this country into as many giveaways to the oil and gas industry as possible,” said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace. “But people who cannot afford the membership fee at Mar-a-Lago still want water they can drink, air they can breathe and beautiful places to go for refuge.” Moving forward, activists say that many of the administration’s moves may not necessarily be long-lasting and, to at least some degree, could be changed by a future Democratic administration. Environmental groups also are suing the administration over virtually every move it makes on the energy and climate front, meaning many policies, ultimately, will be set by federal courts. But what activists fear most are fundamental changes inside the EPA, Energy Department, and Interior Department that cannot be undone. For example, Mr. Pica said the president’s desired 30 percent budget cut at the EPA is the type of massive transformation that would be difficult to reverse. “The rules and the regulations will be litigated over the course of time, but it’s the budget stuff that could have the long-lasting impact on how these agencies operate,” Mr. Pica said.

Senate Democrats block quick vote on stopgap spending bill Senate Democrats late Thursday blocked a quick vote on a short-term spending bill to keep the government open, roiling Washington with brinkmanship less than 30 hours before a midnight Friday deadline for a shutdown and President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressed for an agreement on the short-term legislation that will carry through next week, giving lawmakers more time to complete negotiations on a $1 trillion government-wide spending bill for the remainder of the 2017 budget year. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that any vote only occur when Republicans abandon efforts to add provisions on abortion, financial regulations and the environment to the legislation. “Our position has been clear and it’s nothing news. No poison-pill riders,” Schumer said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/inside-the-beltway-big-weekend-president-protester/
Confirmed: Democratic Party sending protestors to Trump’s ‘100 Day’ speech in Pennsylvania There are two momentous political events to consider this weekend, and they are polar opposites. First, we have President Trump, who will step out on the broad stage of a major arena in Pennsylvania Saturday night for one of his favorite activities: a massive, grass-roots rally to affirm his first 100 days in office and to connect with the voters that love him. The event is not without issue. An anti-Trump protest and rally is planned by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and activists from around the state who claim the president’s time in office has been “filled with alternative facts, incompetence and international scandal.” Then there is the White House Correspondents Dinner in the nation’s capital, staged in a posh hotel some 96 miles to the south. Just as Mr. Trump arrives on stage in Harrisburg, several thousand formally clad journalists, lobbyists and celebrities will stroll out of a dozen different cocktail parties and begin the promenade toward the glittering ballroom, where they will dine on a sumptuous meal and giggle over inside jokes. Many will celebrate the fact that Mr. Trump is not among them. He opted out of the event weeks ago, winning accolades from a number of conservative pundits who applauded his decision to skip a long evening with the mostly hostile press. “Couldn’t agree more. This is a stupid event, and Trump is a serious president. There is no reason why he should indulge his enemies,” noted John Hinderaker, an analyst for Powerline. For the sake of civility, public calm and a bunch of other things, let us hope that both groups have a positive, pleasant, productive experience. Indeed, the White House crowd will enjoy a red carpet walk and 21 assorted pre-parties and after-events sponsored primarily by news organizations and activist groups. The elite population will include such famous folks as actors Billy Bob Thornton and Alyssa Milano, feminist Gloria Steinem and musician Elvis Costello. There has been persistent but unverified chatter that Hillary Clinton, actor and Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin and possibly former President Barack Obama could show up. Mr. Trump has protesters waiting, however. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party has organized “The Rally Against 100 Days of Broken Promises,” which includes Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman Michael Blake, multiple state lawmakers and officials, unions and Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse. “Bring your signs, hats and your slogans,” organizers advise. BODACIOUS: THE NRA IN ATLANTA Some 80,000 people are now happily making their way through the National Rifle Association’s bodacious annual meeting and exposition underway in Atlanta, an event that boasts a significant appearance by President Trump. Other rarefied celebrities also will be present at one time or another, including the NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, and Executive Director Chris W. Cox, Republicans Sens. Ted Cruz and David Perdue, Rep. Clay Higgins, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and former Rep. Allen West. See every speech streamed live online from 12:30 p.m. Friday through Sunday at NRATV.com. In the meantime, Mr. LaPierre does not have anything good to say about the “failing” news media, saying that the press has “never been less trusted, less credible and less respected” and fraught with “malpractice,” among other things. “For decades you ignored calls from millions of gun owners to just tell the truth. All you had to do was to just get the facts right about our guns and our freedom,” Mr. LaPierre says in a fierce public message to the media. “But you never even pretended to listen. Instead you weaponized the First Amendment against the Second Amendment. Now the whole country sees you as a mockery. Your claim to the truth is as legitimate as a thief’s. If the fact of individual freedom had rested in your hands, America would have fallen long ago.” VOTERS OF FAITH STILL LOVE TRUMP Millions of voters of faith voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in November, and they remain his most loyal supporters, according to the Faith & Freedom Coalition, which hosted the president as a candidate and publicly prayed for him during his campaign. “Faith-based voters who ushered President Trump into office last November — who were confident in his commitment to the sanctity of human life, and to his pledge to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with a justice who would respect the Constitution — are extremely pleased with his record of accomplishment this early into his presidency,” says Ralph Reed, chairman of the grass-roots organization, which boasts more than 1 million members. He cites surveys released this week by ABC/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal that reveal, among other things, that Mr. Trump’s strongest base of support remains evangelicals: 70 percent continue to support him, as do 52 percent of conservative Catholic voters.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/alex-acosta-trumps-secretary-labor-confirmed/
Senate confirms last member of Trump Cabinet at 100th day in office nears The Senate on Thursday confirmed Alex Acosta as secretary of labor, filling out President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as he approaches his 100th day in office. The 60-38 vote confirms Acosta to the post. Once sworn as the nation’s 27th secretary of labor, the son of Cuban immigrants will lead an a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. Acosta has been a federal prosecutor, a civil rights chief at the Justice Department and a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He will arrive at the top post with relatively little clear record on some of the top issues facing the administration over key pocketbook issues, such as whether to expand the pool of American workers eligible for overtime pay. Acosta wasn’t Trump’s first choice for the job. Former fast food CEO Andrew Puzder withdrew his name from consideration last month, on the eve of his confirmation vote, after becoming a political headache for the new administration. Puzder acknowledged having hired a housekeeper not authorized to work in the U.S. and paying the related taxes years later – after Trump nominated him – and came under fire from Democrats for other issues related to his company and his private life. Acosta’s ascension would come at a key moment for Trump, just two days before he reaches the symbolic, 100-day mile marker. The White House has sought to cross the threshold with its own list of Trump’s accomplishments. Labor secretary is the last Cabinet post for Trump to fill. Trump’s choice for U.S. trade representative, a job considered Cabinet-level, is awaiting a Senate vote. From the beginning, Acosta’s was a quiet march to confirmation that stood out because it didn’t attract the deep partisan battles faced by some of Trump’s other nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination provoked such a fight that majority Senate Republicans used the “nuclear option” to remove the 60-vote filibuster barrier for Supreme Court picks. Thursday’s vote marks the fourth time Acosta has been confirmed for the Senate. Democrats and most labor groups were mostly muted in their response to Acosta’s nomination. At his confirmation hearing, Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington State and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hammered Acosta for answers on a selection of issues important to labor and whether Acosta would cave to political pressure from Trump. Acosta refused to answer the policy questions until he’s confirmed, and he vowed to be an independent and fair voice for workers. Both senators said they had great concerns, and both were expected to vote no. Our standard can’t be ‘not Puzder,”’ Murray said Wednesday on the Senate floor. But tellingly, even as Acosta’s nomination wound through the Senate, Democrats and their allies also tried to move on to other, labor-related issues – namely, a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour, which Trump opposes. Meanwhile, the Labor Department’s landing page bears a glimpse of Acosta’s policy priorities: “Buy American, Hire American.” That’s the title of Trump’s executive order this week directing the secretaries of labor and other agencies to issue guidance within 60 days on policies that would “ensure that, to the extent permitted by law” federal aid “maximize the use of materials produced in the United States, including manufactured products; components of manufactured products; and materials such as steel, iron, aluminum, and cement.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/congressional-israel-victory-caucus-launch-by-repu/
Congressional Israel Victory Caucus’ launch by Republicans reinforces support for Israel Republicans fortified their growing bond with Israel by launching Thursday the Congressional Israel Victory Caucus, a coalition aimed at promoting widespread recognition of the Jewish state’s right to exist as a predicate to peace. “We founded this caucus primarily on one single irrefutable principle, and that is first and foremost, Israel has a fundamental right to exist and defend herself. And that is not negotiable,” said Rep. Bill Johnson, Ohio Republican, who chairs the caucus with Rep. Ron DeSantis, Florida Republican. No Democratic lawmaker spoke at the press conference to unveil the caucus, which comes with President Trump championing Israel after eight years of strained relations under the Obama administration. Mr. DeSantis is the chairman of the House subcommittee on national security, which oversees U.S. embassies. He cited reports that Mr. Trump is in discussions to visit Israel on May 22, and predicted that the president at that time would announce the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Palestinians have claimed Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.) Mr. DeSantis, who toured in March possible relocation sites for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, noted that such a trip would coincide with the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem Day, which marks the reunification of the city after the Six-Day War in 1967. “I think it will send a powerful signal not only about the U.S.-Israel relationship — that we’re back and stronger than ever — but I think that will send a signal to other countries in the rest of the world that America is back, we’re going to stand by our allies, and that we’re not going to let folks cow us into not doing the right thing,” Mr. DeSantis said. Not one day old, the Congressional Israel Victory Caucus already has come under fire from liberal Jewish groups like J Street and Jewish Voice for Peace, which had urged members of Congress to boycott the launch, as well as pro-Muslim groups like MPower Change. J Street’s Alan Elsner dubbed it the “defeat Palestinians caucus,” arguing that the group is “devoted to pushing the truly terrifying myth that Israel can end the conflict by using brute force and repression to make Palestinians accept their eternal statelessness.” He cited the involvement of Daniel Pipes, president of the pro-Israel Middle East Forum, whom the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center has denounced as an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Mr. Pipes argued for persuading the Palestinian Authority to accept defeat in order to bring an end to the decades-old peace process, which he called the “war process,” saying it has made relations “worse, not better.” “The caucus I see as a beginning, a first step toward educating other members, talking to the administration, talking to allies, that there is an alternative to this desolate, fruitless counterproductive peace process, or war process,” said Mr. Pipes. “There is something else, something that will lead Israel, the Palestinians and the rest of us toward conflict resolution.” In his post, Mr. Elsner urged members of Congress to “stay as far away from such savage and dangerous ideas as possible. The creation of a caucus devoted to promoting them should be condemned, not celebrated.” Two protesters from Code Pink were escorted from the press conference after one unveiled a “Free Palestine” banner and began shouting messages like, “Israel is an apartheid state founded on racism!” Those in attendance and in support of the caucus included representatives of the Zionist Organization of American, Emet, Christians United for Israel and Americans for a Safe Israel, according to the Jerusalem Post. Rep. Keith Rothfus, Pennsylvania Republican, warned that Iranian leaders view Israel as a “one-bomb country,” which he called “something to reflect upon this week in the week of Holocaust remembrance.” “The caucus’ bedrock principle is understanding that Israel has a right to exist and Israel is going nowhere,” Mr. Rothfus said. “It’s unfortunate Israel’s enemies think that Israel will go away someday, but we have to disabuse them of that notion.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

National Border Patrol Council’s president testifies in favor of proposed border wall with Mexico Building more border walls would help funnel drug smugglers over to where agents can catch or stop them, the chief of the Border Patrol agents’ labor union testified to Congress on Thursday, bolstering the case for President Trump’s call for a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico divide. Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, also said a wall is better than fencing because it’s too easy to breach the fence with torches, cutting holes that smugglers can pass their loads through. “I have a brother who’s also a Border Patrol agent, who spent two years and all he did every day is patch holes in a fence,” Mr. Judd recounted in testimony to the House Oversight Committee. “A wall cannot be defeated the way a fence can be defeated.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection is aware of the problem. In its request for prototype walls, it asked for models that will be able to withstand breach attempts for up to four hours. Mr. Judd’s testimony came as debate over the wall heats up on Capitol Hill. While the president said he wouldn’t insist on funding in the spending bill Congress is rushing to pass right now, he will want money by the end of the year to begin construction. Democrats and some Republicans — particularly those from border states — have said Mr. Trump hasn’t justified the wall, and wondered whether more barriers are needed given that illegal crossings are already down dramatically just months into the Trump presidency. Experts said there’s no need for a wall across the border, as Mr. Trump had at one point posited, but some of the specialists said a bit of construction would absolutely help control the flow of illegal contraband across the border. Seth M.M. Stodder, a former senior Homeland Security official, sounded a dissenting note, saying that walls are the wrong solution. He said drug smugglers will take to tunnels or fly hard drugs over the wall, and said building the wall could ruin cooperation with Mexico on anti-terrorism and anti-gang cases. “A wall will not help us address any of the most pressing challenges we face at the border — and likely will make addressing them more difficult,” he said. Mr. Judd, though, said a wall will help funnel drug smugglers, and will also cut down on the cartels’ ability to send illegal immigrants across the border as a distraction. He said smugglers have found they can draw agents’ attention to one part of the border by pushing migrants through there, then carrying or launching a load of heroin across the border elsewhere. Agnes Gibboney, whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant, said a wall would help ease her mind. “I would go and work on the wall myself,” said the woman, who is in her 60s and who appeared before Congress on the 15th anniversary of her son’s slaying. An illegal immigrant was convicted of manslaughter in the case. She bristled at those who have mocked or joked about the wall, saying they haven’t had the same experience she does. “I don’t see what’s funny about it, because they have not been affected by it personally,” she said. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, California Democrat, countered that paying for the wall could siphon money from elsewhere in the budget such as the National Institutes of Health. He said there are “equally compelling parent stories about people losing their lives because we haven’t invested there.” Mr. Judd, whose frequent testimony to Congress often contains shocking details about problems on the border, said lax enforcement policies are actually helping gangs to recruit. He said some illegal immigrants who are caught try to claim asylum and, while detained, then use their time in custody to try to recruit other illegal immigrants into gangs. “They’re actually recruiting, while they’re in our custody, they’re recruit other individuals to join their gangs,” Mr. Judd said.

The knives are out! Elizabeth Warren turns on Obama, she’s ‘troubled’ by $400K Wall Street speech Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she is “troubled” by former President Barack Obama’s decision to give a Wall Street speech for $400,000 this year. An interview between Ms. Warren and Sirius XM’s “Alter Family Politics” on Thursday addressed Mr. Obama’s upcoming conference talk run by Cantor Fitzgerald LP. The Democrat likened the money he will make to “a snake that slithers through Washington” and “ultimately threatens democracy.” “I was troubled by that,” the senator said while discussing “This is our Fight,” her new book. “One of the things I talk about in the book is the influence of money. I describe it as a snake that slithers through Washington. It shows up in so many in so many different ways here in Washington. You know, people understand […] the money that goes into campaign contributions. And when I say ‘understand,’ I don’t mean they think it’s OK — but at least people see it.” The Daily Caller noted Thursday that Mr. Obama’s speaking fees nearly double those obtained by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “The influence of dollars on this place is what scares me,” Ms. Warren said. “I think it ultimately threatens democracy. […] The rich and powerful, they got money and they got power. That’s the definition. But you know, there’s more of us than there is of them.” An analysis of the senator’s net worth on Jan. 8, 2015, by CNN Money found her to be worth between $3.7 million and $10 million. The network’s numbers did not include a three-story home with an estimated worth of $1.9 million. “Roll Call recently ranked her the 76th wealthiest out of 541 senators and representatives, based on her minimum net worth in 2013,” CNN reported. “Her average net worth of $8.75 million, including her home, secures her a spot the Top 1 percent bracket in terms of wealth.” Eric Schultz, Mr. Obama’s spokesman, said Wednesday that any talk about speaking fees for the former president should acknowledge “the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR” that were implemented during his administration.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/chad-connelly-was-on-rncs-payroll-at-start-of-sout/
GOP candidate Connelly was on the RNC’s payroll at start of his campaign One of the Republicans running in South Carolina’s special congressional election was still on the Republican National Committee’s payroll when he began his campaign in February, raising questions among some party members and politicos about the RNC’s role in the race. Chad Connelly was paid $120,000 last year and $31,000 this year by the RNC to serve as the party’s director of faith management. He collected checks until he resigned in early March, the month after he announced his candidacy. Analysts said the legality of the payments depends on the details of the arrangement — but said politically the revelation looks bad because it suggests the national party was picking favorites. “The RNC is a Washington establishment,” said Katon Dawson, a former chairman of South Carolina’s state GOP. “I’m not sure if Chad is on the payroll, but if he is, it would certainly go against what we do in South Carolina, which is we get out of the way of primaries when they start and certainly don’t put the establishment behind any specific candidate.” Mr. Connelly received his first campaign donations Feb. 10, according to federal records, and announced his campaign and filed his organization papers on Feb. 13 — but remained employed by the RNC for weeks afterward. The arrangement was first reported by a South Carolina politics blog, FITSNews.com. Mr. Connelly is one of a half-dozen candidates in the GOP primary next week, ahead of the final election June 20. “Me nor the RNC did anything wrong,” Mr. Connelly told The Washington Times. “We were super careful because we knew somebody would try to say this.” He said he visited roughly 40 states while working for the RNC, trying to rally religious leaders to back the GOP in last year’s elections. He told The Times allegations of impropriety were a political hit job on him, and he said he suspected one of his opponents was upset over his endorsements by members of the House Freedom Caucus and by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. “There’s two really wealthy, self-funded candidates, who I think they assume were going to beat me bad, and they find themselves losing,” he said. Some RNC members said they saw no problem with the overlap. “I’m fine with it. He did so much for the party and work, so I’m sure he and the RNC worked all that out, so I’m comfortable with that,” said Glenn McCall, South Carolina’s RNC committeeman. Texas RNC committeeman Robin Armstrong and Louisiana RNC committeeman Ross Little also praised Mr. Connelly’s work for the RNC and said the paychecks weren’t a concern. “I’m unclear why this is news,” said Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director. He said Mr. Connelly does not currently receive a salary from the party, and said they moved swiftly once he filed paperwork in South Carolina on March 7 to be on the ballot. “Chad did great work for the RNC, but we believed it was appropriate to part ways once it was clear he would be a candidate for Congress, which is why his RNC employment ended the week before his final paperwork was filed,” said Mr. Mahoney. “The RNC is committed to keeping the 5th Congressional District under conservative Republican leadership, and we wish all the Republicans well, but the RNC is not involved in this primary.” Federal Election Commission records showed Mr. Connelly was paid bimonthly in January and February, and collected a final payment of $7,535.34 on March 15, or more than a month after he began raising money for his campaign. Jerad Najvar, an election law attorney in Texas, said the arrangement “could be entirely legitimate,” but it depends on the specific facts of the payments and the work Mr. Connelly was doing. “You just would need more facts. You have to look at the relationship or the arrangement in place before you could determine whether it’s a problem,” said Mr. Najvar. Michael Kang, a law professor at Emory University, said there’s a risk the party could give money to the employee-candidate beyond the contribution limit. “The bigger thing here is the appearance,” said Mr. Kang. “It may be that it doesn’t look very good.” Tom Mullikin, one of Mr. Connelly’s GOP opponents, said he was “disgusted” by the payments. He said the party is supposed to be overseeing a fair and open primary. “I could not have imagined the party paying somebody who had offered himself as a candidate,” he said. R.J. May III, the spokesman for Ralph Norman, a state representative who is also in the running for the congressional seat, said Mr. Connelly had said his ties to the national party were ended. “We are as surprised and disappointed as everyone else,” said Mr. May. Morton Blackwell, Virginia’s RNC committeeman, said the salary payments raised questions. “Human institutions are imperfect, and political parties are no exception,” said Mr. Blackwell. “If a staffer for a national Republican organization was using his position in that organization to give himself an unfair advantage, the donors to whatever organization that was would consider that inappropriate.” Ada Fisher, RNC committeewoman for North Carolina, also thought an appearance of impropriety was inappropriate. “If something like that is happening, you’re going to have to investigate it to find out where the money came from, and you’re going to have to prove it,” said Ms. Fisher. “And that will be kind of hard to prove.” She said in North Carolina, the party is clear that it won’t get involved in Republican primaries. “We want it to be fair to everybody, and people who want to run should be able to run.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/donald-trumps-foreign-policy-makes-impact/
Trump’s unconventional foreign policy makes consequential impact in first 100 days It started with taking a protocol-shattering phone call from Taiwan. Then came an almost immediate realignment with Saudi Arabia against Iran, 59 Tomahawk missiles fired at Syria, an increasingly combative posture toward Russia, a massive military strike in Afghanistan and a level of North Korea brinkmanship not seen from U.S. administrations in decades. For all the roadblocks and headwinds President Trump has faced on the domestic front, there is little debate that he and his unconventional national security team have made a consequential impact on the course and conduct of foreign policy in his first 100 days in office. The man whose populist inauguration speech vowed to put “America first” has been dominating the headlines with aggressive foreign engagement and high-level meetings, including hosting leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago resort. From Canberra and Berlin, from Tokyo and Ankara, Mr. Trump has rankled foreign leaders with his abrasiveness while intriguing them with a willingness to rethink conventional wisdom and conventional policies in American diplomacy. It was at Mar-a-Lago, for instance, that Mr. Trump informed Mr. Xi on April 7 over a “beautiful” piece of chocolate cake that he had authorized airstrikes against Syria — the first by the U.S. to explicitly target the regime of President Bashar Assad over the suspected use of chemical weapons. It was also at his Florida winter White House that Mr. Trump’s increasingly bare-knuckle posture toward North Korea began to develop, when news broke that Pyongyang had tested a ballistic missile just as the president was wining and dining Mr. Abe. In the months since, Mr. Trump has ordered more U.S. military assets to South Korea and dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to the region to deliver the message that the “era of strategic patience” — a reference to Washington’s long-held policy of trying to pressure Pyongyang through sanctions and diplomacy — “is over.” With the prospect of a pre-emptive U.S. strike against North Korea a subject of deep speculation in Washington, Mr. Pence issued his statements on Pyongyang just after the administration’s preference for “hard” over “soft” power was put on dramatic display in Afghanistan with a massive ordnance air blast strike against suspected Islamic State hideouts this month. Critics contend that Mr. Trump still has articulated no clear strategy for North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan or the Islamic State group, let alone Iran, where authorities appear to be bracing for the president to follow through on threats to upend the multinational nuclear accord that President Obama pushed through in 2015. Trump supporters counter that the president’s actions have injected a much-needed degree of unpredictability and flexibility to American power projection around the world. Some argue that Mr. Trump was expected to emerge as a serious foreign policy president because the former property mogul and reality TV star was a global presence long before he had the chance to live on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bumpy ride All sides agree it’s been an unusually bumpy ride at the start, with Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, forced to resign just weeks into the administration. Large numbers of posts below the Cabinet level at the State Department and other agencies have yet to be filled, and a probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign and influence on the November election still hangs over the Trump administration. Still, Mr. Trump’s emerging foreign policy team is starting to win higher marks, with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster showing greater cohesion. World leaders have watched with curiosity as Mr. Trump has altered or, in a few cases, reversed major policy positions he pushed as a candidate. He campaigned on avoiding engagement in Syria’s civil war in favor of a laser focus on defeating the Islamic State terrorist group. Then he launched the missile strikes in retaliation for chemical attacks on civilians by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He declared NATO “obsolete” but has since embraced the alliance. He was accused of cozying up to the Kremlin. Now he is tough-talking to Russia. He branded China a currency manipulator, then ate cake with Mr. Xi. Mr. Trump has talked of these shifts as the mark of a deal-maker, saying on Twitter once: “‘Be flexible enough to adjust to changing circumstances.’ — Think Big.” A combination of impulse-driven action and deal-making savvy has defined the president’s first 100 days. Both were on display just before his inauguration in a December call with Taiwan’s president. It was the first in 40 years between a Taiwanese leader and an American president-elect in the wake of the 1979 “one China” policy. China was outraged. Although Mr. Trump later tamped down friction by saying he wouldn’t break with “one China,” the move appeared to have put Mr. Xi off balance ahead of talks with the new U.S. president. With Mr. Trump proposing a 28 percent cut to the State Department’s budget, Mr. Tillerson still has no administration-appointed deputy and has named only a few U.S. ambassadors to represent the president’s positions around the world. Foreign policy specialists say the evolving situation makes it hard to grade the administration’s diplomacy, even though several acknowledge that they have been impressed by the president’s focus on international affairs. “There remain reasons to be concerned, particularly about the administration’s trade agenda,” Daniel Twining, a director at the German Marshall Fund, said in an analysis that the organization circulated this week. “But U.S. power is back as a force to be reckoned with in a dangerous world, after what many saw as President Obama’s abdication of the U.S. role as global guarantor and following a political campaign in which the U.S. was presented as a victim of globalization rather than as its engine.” While others argue there is uncertainty over where U.S. foreign policy is headed — or which country Washington might bomb next — Mr. Twining has been joined by a range of hawkish analysts in praising Mr. Trump’s initial forays. Georgetown University Professor Matthew Kroenig, writing in Foreign Affairs, praised Mr. Trump’s aggressive posture, particularly compared with his predecessor’s. “Trump has begun to correct the failures of the past eight years and position the United States well for the challenges to come,” Mr. Kroenig wrote. “With greater adherence to a core strategy going forward, Trump may well, as [Henry] Kissinger predicted was possible, go ‘down in history as a very considerable president.’” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/nra-got-election-wins-now-wants-action/
NRA determined to turn major election wins into permanent gun rights for Americans ATLANTA — Gun rights backers need to make sure that election victories translate into action on Capitol Hill and expanded support in the states, the National Rifle Association’s legislative chief said Thursday, a day ahead of President Trump’s speech at the NRA’s annual convention. Enacting concealed-carry reciprocity, which would allow permit holders from one state to carry their weapons anywhere else in the U.S., is a top priority for the NRA now that the organization has a friendly Congress and a president it eagerly backed. But Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told The Washington Times that NRA members can’t become complacent in the post-Obama era. “We’ll leave Atlanta with a determination to make sure that November wasn’t a temporary moment but a permanent political red line,” he said. “American freedom and individual freedom is too important to suffer due to apathy. NRA members know that, and I think you’re going to see a reflection of that this weekend.” Mr. Cox said the NRA is excited to have Mr. Trump in the White House but that the work isn’t done. “This is an important time in Second Amendment history,” he said. “It was a critical battle that was won, but the war rages on and we’re still getting up and fighting every day to protect the rights of our members, and it’s going to be a big celebration of that this weekend in Atlanta.” Mr. Cox said executive actions such as the selection of Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court and rolling back an Obama-era rule on Social Security and gun background checks give Mr. Trump a solid A thus far. “Across the board, we are seeing measurables and deliverables from President Trump as it relates to the Second Amendment,” he said. “Now, does that mean everything’s done and we need to all stop worrying? Of course not. The fight’s still there; we have to continue to push the ball forward,” he said. At the top of the list at the federal level is getting the national concealed carry reciprocity bill through Congress and onto Mr. Trump’s desk. “The expansion of self-defense will remain our No. 1 legislative priority until the rights of law-abiding Americans are respected,” Mr. Cox said. “We’re working hard to educate and encourage co-sponsorship and work through the appropriate legislative process, and at the same time leveraging our greatest asset in this fight, which are NRA members all across this country,” he said. “So we feel good about our chances, but there’s a lot of work to do, obviously,” he said. All 50 states allow some kind of concealed carry, but they have different rules and requirements about how people obtain permits and which out-of-state permits are recognized. Gun rights advocates say a national standard should be set, but opponents of such a move say a federal bill could undermine states that have imposed stricter rules. “Get it passed — I don’t care how they do it,” said Paul Heimbach, 78, a retired Air Force officer from Florida. “The Democrats are going to be against it regardless.” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said he has no doubt that concealed carry reciprocity will pass the House but not necessarily the Senate. Republicans control 52 of the 100 Senate seats but would have to attract some Democratic support to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to thwart any filibuster. “Getting the bill through the Senate will be a little bit tougher,” Mr. Pratt said. “We have a clear majority of senators supporting the bill, and we are working to make sure there are enough to break a filibuster.” Beyond Congress, though, Mr. Cox said the NRA is engaged at the state level as well. “We saw in Iowa a comprehensive pro-Second Amendment bill signed into law,” he said. “We’ve seen in state after state more pro-gun laws. No anti-gun legislation has been signed into law this year, but obviously we’re working hard to make sure that holds. “Whether it takes us into the Congress or onto the airwaves or into state legislatures or into courtrooms, that’s where you’ll find us,” he said. The NRA endorsed Mr. Trump at its convention last year in Louisville, Kentucky, months before the he formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Cox said the president’s attendance this year indicates that he knows how critical that support was. On Friday, Mr. Trump will become the first sitting U.S. president to speak at the convention since Ronald Reagan. “We made that commitment early,” Mr. Cox said. “We were consistent. It was a lonely summer. There were times when we were the only group in America with the guts to support him.” “But we never wavered because the stakes of the election and consequences of [the] election never changed,” he said. Gun control activists are planning to protest in Atlanta this weekend after Mr. Trump’s appearance and have tried to organize aggressively on lobbying efforts in recent years as well. Mr. Cox said the NRA can’t go “dollar for dollar” with someone like former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who helped found the group Everytown for Gun Safety. “But what we’ve been able to do is beat him vote by vote,” he said. “So if he wants to engage in this issue, we welcome the fight.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/trump-will-continue-obamacare-payments/
Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill The White House told congressional leaders Wednesday that the administration will continue making Obamacare cost-sharing payments, eliminating the biggest sticking point as lawmakers rush to pass a final 2017 spending bill and avert a government shutdown looming at the end of the week. Democrats had wanted to include the funds in the spending bill, but Republicans had balked, saying they’d never been included before — though President Barack Obama had doled out the money anyway, in what a judge has ruled an illegal expense. The Trump administration’s promise to continue the payments without congressional approval preserves a GOP anti-Obamacare lawsuit, but still keeps the money flowing, which Democrats said was their most important goal. SEE ALSO: GOP lawmakers push one-week stopgap bill to prevent government shutdown “Our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about the [cost-sharing] payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. We’ve now made progress on both of these fronts,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. Mr. Trump agreed earlier this week to pull his demand that money for his wall be included in the spending bill. That put pressure on Democrats to drop their insistence on Obamacare funding. But Mrs. Pelosi said a deal is still proving elusive. “More progress needs to be made on some of our priorities, and we continue to be concerned about poison-pill riders that are still in this legislation,” she said. “Our appropriators are working in good faith toward a bipartisan proposal to keep government open.” The government has been running on stopgap funding since Oct. 1, or nearly seven months. Congress needs to pass a new bill by midnight Friday or else the government will face a partial shutdown. Late Wednesday, House Republicans announced a one-week stopgap bill that would carry the government through May 5. That bill, which needs to pass by Friday, would buy more room for negotiations. Obamacare payments emerged as a stumbling block earlier this month after Mr. Trump threatened to withhold the money as a negotiating tactic on the broader health care repeal. Democrats demanded certainty in the money, saying the health markets count on those payments to make Obamacare work. House Republicans, however, had challenged the payments as illegal, saying Congress had specifically nixed the money. A federal judge agreed with them, ruling Mr. Obama acted illegally. Including the payments in the new spending bill could have invalidated that lawsuit — though even some Republicans said it wasn’t fair to end the payments now while the rest of Obamacare is intact. “A lot of us, myself included, think those subsidies ought to be continued until we have an alternative. I think we owe that to the companies, I think you owe that to the people in the health care system,” said Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican. Having the White House agree to make the payments was the middle-ground solution. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Wednesday morning that there were still other stumbling blocks, including federal support for a health fund for retired miners and money to bolster Puerto Rico’s struggling Medicaid system. An even bigger hurdle, though, appears to be the personalities involved. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he’d been pushing Mr. Schumer to negotiate directly with the White House to try to get a bill done, but said the Democratic leader was refusing even to talk to the president. Mr. Schumer countered that was because he wasn’t going to negotiate at all as long as Mr. Trump was seeking funding for the border wall. “Senator McConnell wanted me to negotiate the wall with President Trump. I said to him two things: First, it’s not a negotiation. No wall. And second, I said, only you can persuade him that he shouldn’t do the wall because it’ll cause a government shutdown,” Mr. Schumer said. And Mr. Trump himself took to Twitter on Wednesday evening to blame the Democrats’ demands for the difficult negotiations. “Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!” he wrote. Democrats’ disdain for Mr. Trump bled over into the House as well, where Mrs. Pelosi met with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Tuesday night, and then attacked him as an obstructionist a day later. “Congressman Mick Mulvaney was a chief architect of the government shutdown in 2013. He not only voted to shut down government but voted against ending the shutdown. He also voted to default on the full faith and credit of the United States,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Democrats are confident that if there is a government shutdown, the GOP would take the blame, emboldening the minority party to press its demands. But Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said Democrats are the ones angling for a shutdown, believing it will energize their base. “I think Chuck Schumer and the Democrats want a shutdown,” he continued, “I think they’re trying to provoke a fight.” • Tom Howell Jr. and Sally Persons contributed to this article.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/isis-al-qaeda-in-talks-for-terror-merger/
Islamic State in talks for terrifying merger with al Qaeda as battlefield defeats mount It’s the terrorist marriage made in hell. The Islamic State group and al Qaeda, long rivals for supremacy in the jihadi struggle, are feeling more pressure to combine as the Islamic State loses its territorial base in Syria and Iraq and the still-potent terrorist network founded by Osama bin Laden prepares to welcome legions of foreign fighters fleeing the advancing U.S.-backed coalition, analysts and officials in the region say. “The discussion [on combining forces] has started now,” Iraqi Vice President Ayad Allawi warned this month in an interview with the Reuters news agency. Born out of al Qaeda’s Iraqi faction that battled U.S. and coalition forces during the bloody years of the American combat mission, the jihadis famously broke with the Pakistani-based terrorist group in 2012 to form the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Two years later, the group would declare a “caliphate,” rename itself the Islamic State and rule a wide swath of the Middle East stretching from its self-styled capital of Raqqa, Syria, to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. But with its fighters near defeat in Mosul and U.S.-led coalition forces preparing for the final assault on Raqqa, the Islamic State is poised to go underground and revert to a classic guerrilla force, analysts say. That opens an avenue for re-establishing links with al Qaeda, which has focused on developing a global network of terrorist “franchises” rather than seeking to control and administer its own territorial state. The Islamic State group briefly did what al Qaeda couldn’t do in seizing and holding ungoverned space for a “caliphate,” said one U.S. official who spoke anonymously with The Washington Times. That development helped draw thousands of foreign fighter recruits who likely would have been rejected by al Qaeda. Al Qaeda “always wanted these immaculate recruits, while ISIS wanted to take anybody willing to join,” the official said. “But now we have this next generation of foreign fighter jihadists who have been trained on the ISIS battlefield.” The flow of battle-hardened jihadis fleeing the black banners of the Islamic State in the face of the coalition onslaught in Syria and Iraq, seeking to rejoin their brothers in arms in al Qaeda, is already underway, a top national security analyst said. “We have a dispersed ISIS and a still-potent al Qaeda network to reckon with, and we may even see something of a reconciliation between the two groups,” said Thomas Sanderson, director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, al Qaeda is not the only extremist group that will benefit from the pool of recruits built by the Islamic State, said Richard Burchill, director of research and engagement at Trends Research and Advisory, an Abu Dhabi-based think tank. “Various jihadist insurgency groups and terrorists will be able to benefit from the defeat of Daesh as they can continue to recruit to the cause through the politicization of religion,” said Mr. Burchill, using the Arabic name for the group. “Unfortunately, due to the ideas of political Islam being pursued, there is a wide audience for extremism and many groups looking to exploit individuals.” Talks underway Discussions about an alliance have already begun between Islamic State chieftain Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, bin Laden’s successor, via envoys and messengers from the terrorist groups, Iraq’s Mr. Allawi said. “I can’t see ISIS disappearing into thin air. They will remain covertly in sleeping cells, spreading their venom all over the world,” likely with weapons, funding and support from al Qaeda’s network, he said. Al-Baghdadi remains in hiding within the Islamic State group’s territory in Syria after reportedly fleeing Raqqa in March. Meanwhile, al-Zawahri reportedly remains in hiding along the Afghan-Pakistani border and has just released an audiotape to followers. Al-Zawahri did not directly refer to the Islamic State in his remarks, but urged fighters in Syria to “prepare yourselves for a long battle with the crusaders and their allies the Shiites and Alawites,” a reference to the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad and his ally Iran. The divisions between al Qaeda and the Islamic State over strategy and tactics have played out on the ground in conflicts far beyond Syria. Rival Islamic State and al Qaeda factions operate in Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh. In Somalia, the jihadi al-Shabab group is divided into camps pledging allegiance to either al-Baghdadi or al-Zawahri. Aside from disputes over the value of holding territory, the Islamic State and al Qaeda show clear differences on tactical details. Islamic State operatives are typically prepared to inflict far more civilian casualties in their terrorist strikes than is al Qaeda. Despite the contentious public splintering of al Qaeda and its Iraqi faction in 2012, signs of reconciliation began to emerge in the wake of the Islamic State’s spectacular victories in Iraq and Syria. CIA Director John O. Brennan said in 2015 that while there was significant competition between the Islamic State and “core al Qaeda” under al-Zawahri’s control, he was not surprised by a call for unity by al-Zawahri because “an emphasis of al Qaeda throughout the course of its history has been that Muslims — they call themselves Muslims — should unite as part of what they see as a holy jihad.” “That call for unity has always been part of al Qaeda’s mantra,” Mr. Brennan said. “I think they point to al-Baghdadi and [the Islamic State] as being almost an aberration and as not being, in fact, true to the cause. “What [al-Zawahri], I think, is saying is that there needs to be the unification of these efforts under the rightful sort of banner of al Qaeda,” Mr. Brennan said. His 2015 comments suggested that the CIA’s view is that once the charismatic al-Baghdadi is ultimately killed by a U.S. or allied airstrike, al Qaeda will swoop in and claim the loyalty of tens of thousands of foreign fighters and other young jihadis who have flocked to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State. But as the end draws near for the Islamic State’s physical caliphate in the Middle East, one of the big questions is whether al Qaeda’s old-guard leaders — including al-Zawahri — are poised to draw in and rebrand Islamic State recruits as global al Qaeda operatives. “There’s a lot of uncertainty about the way forward and the extent to which al Qaeda and its affiliates will become a magnet for these former ISIS guys who’ve managed to slip away and go back home,” said another U.S. official, speaking on background. “But it really remains an open question how and whether core al Qaeda could benefit once ISIS leadership and [the] caliphate are taken out.” Killing the ideology All sides in the debate agree that the expected defeat of the Islamic State on the battlefield — perhaps by the end of the year — won’t end the larger war. “The defeat of [the Islamic State] on the battlefield will not bring a decline in terrorists and fighters,” said Trends Research and Advisory President Ahmed Al-Hamli. Distorted understandings given to Islam by extremist ideologues in al Qaeda and the Egyptian-based Muslim Brotherhood continue to inspire violent movements in the name of religion, he said in an interview. “They are defined by the idea of ruling in the name of God, and this dangerous ideology will continue to be a threat,” he said. But killing an ideology is not as simple as carrying out a drone strike or night raid, as Pentagon and the intelligence community have discovered. The Defense Department last year launched a secretive cybercampaign to dismantle the Islamic State’s vast online recruiting network. Touting the use of cyberbombs, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter heralded such efforts as invaluable to breaking the group’s ideological aura online, which had drawn thousands of young jihadis to the cause. But attacks continued, further frustrating the Obama administration. What has made the Islamic State so dangerous is that it is often the ideology alone that ties the group’s terrorist cells and operatives worldwide, a top U.S. counterterrorism official said. While al Qaeda has planted individual operatives inside the U.S. to plan, coordinate and launch attacks, those sleeper cells maintained ties to the group’s chain of command that U.S. and allied intelligence agencies could exploit, said Army Lt. Gen. Michael K. Nagata, head of strategic operational planning at the National Counterterrorism Center. The lack of such linkages, especially by “lone wolf” attackers and returning veterans of the Islamic State wars in Iraq and Syria, means that the potential recruiting pool of foreign fighters threatening the U.S. and the West is staggering. “A lot of what comes out of ISIS is just, ‘Go where you can and kill who you can,’” Gen. Nagata said. “There’s an inherent danger to this, because their use of foreign fighters [is] more unpredictable. “Even though they acted to save their skin by fleeing Iraq and Syria, there’s still a latent desire to wreak havoc. And they’ll find an outlet for that.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/first-amendment-under-attack-by-liberals/
Spooked by the power of words, words, words ANALYSIS/OPINION: The only thing anyone is allowed to hear on campus is a slogan. Thinking is so 20th century (and early 20th century at that). The adults paid to be in charge have retreated to a safe place, where never is heard an encouraging word and the skies are cloudy all day. The First Amendment has been under the latest assault for months, and this week Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and onetime chairman of the Democratic Party, finally said out loud what certain prominent Democrats have hinted at and alluded to, that free speech does not necessarily include extending it to anyone who disagrees with them. This poison spread, like so much of the toxic stuff polluting the body politic, from the campuses of the elite. Particularly the University of California at Berkeley, where visiting speakers with something to say can’t say it because it might offend the sophomore class. Cowardice rules in the university president’s office and ignorance rules in Sproul Plaza. A speech by Ann Coulter, the firebrand columnist, was canceled because everyone was afraid of what she might say. Miss Coulter, a slender woman who might weigh 90 pounds stepping out of a shower, was eager to take her chances facing down the mob to say her piece, whatever that piece might have been, but the Berkeley cops, the university administration, the sponsoring Young America’s Foundation and the College Republicans, all trembled, looked one way and then the other, and took a powder lest the hooded brownshirts — dressed in black with robbers’ masks, actually — disrupt the tranquility of the campus. The editors of National Review magazine observed with a bit of acid that Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California System, was Barack Obama’s Director of Homeland Security and was responsible for keeping al Qaeda out of New York and Washington, but she can’t secure a lecture hall on a California college campus. But even in defending free speech and all that free speech means, the editors prefaced their condemnation of cowardice and outrage at Berkeley with something of an apology for defending Miss Coulter: “We have had our differences with Ann Coulter over the years, differences that led to our eventually declining to continue publishing her work. She is charming and funny and sometimes brilliant. She is also a glib and irresponsible self-promoter. We suspect that she will not like having that written about her. We suspect that she might write something in reply.” But the editors think it is nevertheless wrong, or at least inappropriate, to chase her off the campus. Probably. Howard Dean likes free speech and the First Amendment well enough, but with appropriate edits and the proper emendations. He looked at the work of the Founding Fathers with a physician’s eye and saw that the guarantee was not absolute, as the Founding Fathers thought it was. The amendment does not protect “hate speech,” which he thinks is anything unpleasant for a good fellow like him to hear. The Founding Fathers thought they succeeded in writing the guarantee in stark, plain English — so plain and so clear, in fact, that even a lawyer could understand it: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” No ifs, ands, or buts, and not a single whereas. Nothing there about hate speech, exclusions, preclusions or exceptions. This gives some people palpitations. It’s no mystery why such people are invariably at the likes of Berkeley and Yale and Middlebury. You’re not as likely to see or hear proposed footnotes to the First Amendment at the likes of Southeast North Dakota State, Utah A&M or Ouachita Baptist College. “In First Amendment law,” says Glenn Harlan Reynolds, the distinguished professor of constitutional law at the University of Tennessee, “the term ‘hate speech’ is meaningless. All speech is equally protected whether it’s hateful or cheerful. It doesn’t matter if it’s racist, sexist or in poor taste, unless speech falls into a few very narrow categories — like ‘true threats,’ which have to address a specific individual, or ‘incitement,’ which must constitute an immediate and intentional encouragement to imminent lawless action — it’s protected.” There’s a reason why the Founders put the First Amendment first. It’s the most important part of the Constitution, and as important as the rest of the Bill of Rights is, the First Amendment is the most important. With free speech, the people are armed to protect all other rights. Without it, the people are disarmed, and tyrants, the vile and ignorant like the students on certain campuses among us, rule. We allow that at our deadly peril. • Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/ann-coulter-the-latest-target-of-liberal-attack-on/
Coulter the latest target of liberal attack on free speech ANALYSIS/OPINION: Liberals ready and willing to resort to violence in support of their views have just won a round in their war to suppress free speech in America. After much back and forth, conservative commentator Ann Coulter has canceled a speech at University of California, Berkeley primarily because of the lack of protection from the local police and the inability to ensure the safety of Ms. Coulter and those attending her address. Ms. Coulter called it “a sad day for free speech.” I say it’s a sad day for America. America cannot become another Cuba or North Korea, where citizens have no right to speak freely. The right to free speech is enshrined in our Bill of Rights, and those extreme liberals who are terrorizing college campuses and targeting conservatives have the ultimate goal of silencing any opposing voices. We must all stand against this kind of intimidation on campuses. Free speech should be one of those causes on which both conservatives and liberals can find common ground. Liberal professor Cornel West said on Fox News that he is committed to “unnerving students,” adding that college campuses should be “unsettled spaces rather than safe spaces.” College is a time for developing critical thought, facing tough questions and fostering intellectual curiosity — which means being exposed to different points of views. None of that can happen when liberal bullies call their conservative peers insulting names and block the expression of alternative, conservative views on campus — a traditional oasis of freedom of thought and expression. Berkeley, of course, has a history of its own on the issue. Over 1,000 students in 1964 joined the Free Speech Movement and held a protest demanding that the university lift a ban on political activities and free expression. Today, on that same campus, bandits and anarchists are effectively in charge, employing violent tactics to suppress conservative political activities and events. University administrators lack the will and the power to face down the bullies. Conservatives speakers have become an easy target for those liberals, who are always ready to denounce anyone who challenges their beliefs as sexists and racists. Ms. Coulter, thankfully, does not shy away from the controversy but confronts it, exposing the hypocrisy of her accusers at every turn. Last year, the provocative author and commentator participated in an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, a proponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants, where she answered tough questions on immigration from an audience that included those in the U.S. illegally. These individuals did not agree with her, but it was an opportunity for real give-and-take. Berkeley students have been deprived of the same opportunity by those liberals who use violence to enforce political correctness on our college campuses, creating fear, trampling on our constitutional rights and promoting an anti-American philosophy. When I was a college student, my alma mater, Florida International University, hosted an event for Cuban communists. With so many students at the school coming from families who had recently fled the murderous Castro regime, it was obviously an emotional day for many of us. I remember feeling, in Mr. West’s word, “unnerved,” but I listened to the speakers’ critical views of the United States and their doctrinal speeches on the glories of communism. We engaged in heated conversations, but the exchange was, in the end, enlightening. It helped me further understand the evils of communism and the ignorance of those individuals who live under the regime and follow the dictator’s rules. In Cuba, of course, I would never have been allowed to participate in a similar forum at University of Havana, or to criticize Castro on Cuban soil. It simply was not allowed. The United States literally came into being because of the Founding Fathers’ willingness to debate and disagree — often heatedly — on issues such as state rights, federalism and the rights of the governed. They understood more than two centuries ago that open forums of debate and discussion were fundamental to finding common ground and to the long-term health of the American experiment. The growing intolerance on campus — and the willingness of university administrators to shelter their students from challenging voices and contrary opinions — will have long-term negative effects. By excluding conservatives from their debates and allowing those willing to use violence to dominate the conversation, the universities lose their own voice and are weakened as institutions. Extreme liberal groups with a violent agenda should not win. Freedom of speech and the U.S. Constitution must prevail. • Mercedes Schlapp is a Fox News contributor, co-founder of Cove Strategies and former White House director of specialty media under President George W.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/hillary-clinton-doomed-her-inevitable-presidency/
How Hillary doomed her ‘inevitable presidency’ ANALYSIS/OPINION: While we’re examining the accomplishments of Donald Trump’s first 100 days — putting his man on the U.S. Supreme Court is the biggie — Hillary Clinton is getting the once-over (and the second and third) for all the reasons why she’s not the first woman to preside over her own first 100 days in the Oval Office. She never understood that “the fault, dear Hillary, is not in the stars, but in yourself.” In “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign,” the book Washington is talking about, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, write a sweeping drama with lots of supporting actors strutting across the stage. The characters are worthy of the Bard. It’s a tale told not in the poetry of Elizabethan tragedy, but as comedy or farce. When the curtain finally falls on election night, there are no dead bodies to drag offstage, but lots of Machiavellian characters litter the landscape, muttering asides and revealing dark insights into behind-the-scenes machinations. The cast includes a husband with no “impulse-control button,” and enough jesters, fools and sycophants to destroy the myth of the irresistible Hillary juggernaut ordained to elect the first woman president of the United States. In one richly farcical case of mistaken identity, an aide misunderstands the name of the interviewer Hillary wanted for her first television interview. She said she wanted “Bianna,” meaning Bianna Golodryga of Yahoo! News, the wife of Peter Orszag, a onetime Clinton administration economic adviser, whom she considered friendly and deferential. The aide thought she meant “Brianna,” as in Brianna Keilar, and that’s who got the live interview for CNN. She asked tough questions about Hillary’s infamous email server. Hillary grew defensive, especially when she was asked, “Would you vote for someone you didn’t trust?” This was a classic softball, which someone at ease with the press might have knocked out of the park. Instead, she glared daggers at the questioner, and replied, as if in a sulk, “People should and do trust me.” The lady doth protest too much, methinks — and so did much of the national audience. Such insights, errors and sloppy staff work dogged her throughout the campaign, and this after-the-fact focus in this season of her discontent shows her to be the culprit in her demise. “Shattered” supports why a Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that Donald Trump, despite low approval ratings, would still defeat Hillary in the Electoral College, and this time in the popular vote as well, by 43 percent for the Donald and 40 percent for the Lady Macbeth late of Little Rock. A remarkable 96 percent of Trump voters say they would vote for him again, and only 15 percent of Hillary voters would still vote for her. Richard Nixon might have felt at home in the Hillary bunker. After her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Hillary aides assigned loyalty scores to members of Congress, from 1 to 7. A score of 1 reflected high loyalty, 7 likely to commit “egregious acts of treachery.” Such expectations of disloyalty terrified everyone in the bunker. Donald Trump, by contrast, inspires a different kind of loyalty. His supporters stick with him despite his evident flaws, his angry tweets, anger that can go public in an instant. They nevertheless believe he’s got their back. There’s no mushy empathy like the Clintons’ phony assurance that “we feel your pain.” The president’s fans don’t like some of the things he’s done, but still think he’ll deliver on his promise to bring about change, and destroy the establishment of the elites that has grown fat and stale, surviving long past their sell-by date. In town halls during spring break, many voters vented anger at congressmen for their support of the president. But Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, typical of the president’s loyal friends in Congress, offered a defense. “We’d be hard pressed to find a president who doesn’t have flaws,” she said. “I support a majority of the policies versus the actual person.” A Bubba defender couldn’t have said it better. Hillary has yet to measure the man or understand the “ordinary” men and women who stand with the president. When her aides, preparing her for one of the debates, had to choose someone to play the Donald, casting was a problem because the campaign didn’t want a Saturday Night Live imitation, but someone to rattle and annoy her. Anthony Weiner, the suspect sex-texter husband of Huma Abedin, was suggested. But Phillipe Reines, a senior aide with an acid tongue and a reputation for rudeness, was selected. He helped her to an unflappable debate performance, but couldn’t do anything about the school-marm style that turned off the millions. Hillary is a woman of many gifts, but not what the poet Bobby Burns described as “the gift to see ourselves as others see us.” It was the fatal flaw. • Suzanne Fields is a columnist for The Washington Times and is nationally syndicated.

Trump to pull feds out of K-12 education President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to start pulling the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials. The order, dubbed the “Education Federalism Executive Order,” will launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts and directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government. “For too long the government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,” Mr. Trump said. “My administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab and give power back to families, cities [and] states — give power back to localities.” He said that previous administrations had increasingly forced schools to comply with “whims and dictates” from Washington, but his administration would break the trend. “We know local communities know it best and do it best,” said Mr. Trump, who was joined by several Republican governors for the signing. “The time has come to empower teachers and parents to make the decisions that help their students achieve success.” Ms. DeVos and Vice President Mike Pence were on hand for the ceremony, which was attended by about 25 people, including teachers, lawmakers and the governors. The executive order is not expected to have an immediate impact on school districts. Policy changes will follow a report on the findings of the review. The review will be spearheaded by the Department of Education’s Regulatory Review Task Force, according to the order. Ms. DeVos already has authority to modify or repeal regulations that are deemed a violation of federal law. The order, however, creates a review for identifying those areas and makes clear her mandate from the president to take action. Reducing the federal government’s role in K-12 is part of Mr. Trump’s reform agenda, which also includes the expansion of school choice programs. Among those at the signing ceremony were Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Gary Herbert of Utah, Paul LePage of Maine, Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Terry Branstad of Iowa, who also is Mr. Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China. Also in attendance were Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the Republican chairs of the two chambers’ education committees.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/planned-parenthood-defunding-lobbyists-deliver-200/
Socked: Pro-lifers deliver 200,000 baby socks to Congress in plea to defund Planned Parenthood Brightly colored baby socks flooded the halls of the U.S. Capitol Wednesday, representing the hundreds of thousands of lives lost annually to Planned Parenthood, and sending the unmistakable message to Congress to defund the nation’s largest abortion provider. Spearheaded by Students for Life of America, the SockIt2PP campaign collected 196,543 baby socks and plans to deliver a total of 323,299 to match the number of abortions Planned Parenthood performed last year. “It’s a devastatingly large number,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, standing on a podium above a giant mound of baby socks outside of the Capitol. “And we need to have images like this so that people start to reflect on the magnitude of suffering that’s happening out there.” On Wednesday volunteers delivered 88,000 socks to members of Congress — the number of abortions Planned Parenthood has performed during the first 100 days of the new administration. The demonstration comes in the midst of policy negotiations that will decide the fate of Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million in taxpayer funding every year to keep its doors open. Before delivering the socks, pro-life activists, lawmakers and students held a rally on a Capitol Hill lawn. The baby socks were predominantly white, pink and blue. Others were patterned with soccer balls, polka dots and Batman logos. Sue Thayer, a former Planned Parenthood center manager who is now a pro-life activist, said the baby socks were like something out of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum down the street. “There should be little feet in all of these socks,” Ms. Thayer said. “There should be little babies in all of these socks.” The baby socks were sent in from students at hundreds of high school and college chapters of Students for Life and other pro-life organizations. Purity Thomas, president of the Roanoke Students for Life, said it’s unthinkable that “we allow our tax dollars to go to the funding of an organization that murders innocent children daily.” “This is an organization that kills our brothers and sisters,” Ms. Thomas said. “How, as a nation, have we allowed this?” Emily Brown, youth director at American Life League, said the baby socks send an unmistakable message. “Today we’re sending a clear message to Congress that enough is enough,” Ms. Brown said. “We cannot sit around while Planned Parenthood slaughters the most innocent human beings among us.” In order to avoid a Senate filibuster, Republicans have said they will defund Planned Parenthood simultaneously with the repeal of Obamacare through the reconciliation process. The repeal bill took a major step toward enactment Wednesday, when it received the endorsement of the House Freedom Caucus. The conservative stalwarts had blocked the American Health Care Act last month because it did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare. Samuel Matthews, president of Huntington High School Students for Life, said an organization that “calls taking the life of boys and girls in the womb ‘empowering’” does not deserve taxpayer funding. “We are here because we have a problem with Planned Parenthood,” Mr. Matthews said. “And one day soon, Planned Parenthood will be defunded.” Mr. Sasse said pictures showing the humanity of the unborn are a “huge reason why” the youngest generation is more pro-life than previous ones. “And this picture that you’re trying to create today is another special way to tell the story of what we’re about.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/paris-climate-accord-eyed-as-treaty/
How Team Trump plans to kill Obama’s Paris climate deal by declaring it a treaty As President Trump’s top advisers prepare to hash out a final policy on the Paris climate agreement dumped onto their laps by President Obama, another option has hit the table: Declare the deal a treaty and send it to the Senate to be killed. The treaty option could emerge as the middle ground in the increasingly tense battle between “remainers” on the one hand, who say the president should abide by Mr. Obama’s global warming deal, and the Paris agreement’s detractors, who say Mr. Trump would be breaking a key campaign promise if he doesn’t withdraw from the pact. Mr. Trump’s principal advisers are slated to meet Thursday to hash out a final set of recommendations for the president, with several deadlines looming next month. At an initial meeting of top staffers Tuesday, several memos and letters that were circulated laid out the options, including the treaty proposal put forth by Christopher C. Horner and Marlo Lewis Jr., senior fellows at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Under their vision, Mr. Trump could toss out Mr. Obama’s decision that the Paris accord was an executive agreement, declare it a treaty and send it to the Senate, where it would need a two-thirds vote for ratification. Given Republican control of the chamber, the agreement’s opponents say senators would either shelve the deal or outright defeat it. Either option would derail the deal, the memo suggested. “That option affirms that we are a nation of laws, not men and, importantly, discourages both our negotiating partners and future U.S. officials against attempting to circumvent our system,” the memo says. A briefing paper circulated among Republican senators this week said the deal should have been sent to Capitol Hill by Mr. Obama, but he “knew that Congress would never approve such a flawed deal, so he refused to seek the Senate’s advice and consent.” Supporters of the Paris accord have their own memo drafted by lawyers in the State Department. That memo says that by sending the agreement to the Senate, the president would be giving up important powers and leave Mr. Trump and his successors open to congressional meddling. “Because the large majority of international agreements concluded by the United States are concluded as executive agreements, this could have far-reaching implications for our conduct of foreign affairs,” the State Department document says. The Paris agreement is the main international vehicle for trying to combat climate change. Mr. Obama committed the U.S. to the deal in 2015 but never submitted it for ratification, saying it was an extension of a U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which the Senate ratified in 1992. The State Department memo says there are few risks to remaining part of the Paris deal. It says the “legal obligations are relatively few and are generally process-oriented [and] discretionary in their application or repeat existing obligations already contained in the Framework Convention.” Michael McKenna, a Republican energy strategist, said anything short of withdrawal would leave the U.S. open to legal challenges, with judges potentially attempting to enforce strict climate limits based on the commitments. “The president is being asked to travel a path that leads him — ultimately — to continue the Obama administration policies on climate change,” said Mr. McKenna, who has authored his own memo calling for withdrawal. He blamed Obama administration “holdovers” at the State Department for trying to preserve their former boss’ plans. Mr. Obama committed the U.S. to cutting greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The former president tried to enforce the commitment through a series of executive and administration actions, imposing tight limits on power plants and auto emissions. Federal courts have halted some of those plans, and Mr. Trump and Congress have nixed others, easing the pressure on American industry. During the campaign, Mr. Trump also pledged to cancel the Paris deal. As a decision nears, the sides among Mr. Trump’s top advisers have become clear. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday appeared to join the remainers, though he said the deal should be renegotiated. “I’m not going to tell the president of the United States to walk away from the Paris accord,” Mr. Perry said at a conference sponsored by Bloomberg. “I will say that we need to renegotiate it.” Mr. Perry said other countries are breaking their self-imposed commitments, giving the U.S. an opportunity to insist on changes. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is a remainer, as are perhaps Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. The White House general counsel’s office also appears to be leaning toward remain, sources familiar with the negotiations said. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is pushing for withdrawal, and he is joined by U.N. Ambassador Nikki R. Haley, analysts said. Top presidential strategist Stephen K. Bannon is also a withdrawal advocate. Exxon Mobil Corp. has written a letter urging the administration to stick with the Paris agreement, and the National Mining Association said this week, after its leaders met with Mr. Pruitt, that it will push for withdrawal, Politico reported. The next test for the Paris accord will be in the middle of May, when finance ministers of the Group of Seven major economies meet in Italy. The heads of state meet at the end of the month. The leaders are hoping for a communique reaffirming the Paris agreement, while opponents within the U.S. are hoping to prevent that, saying it would tie Mr. Trump’s hands going forward.

Page says he’s the victim of ‘horrendous civil rights violations’ Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page said Thursday he’s a victim of a civil rights crime. “I’ve been the victim of one of the most horrendous civil rights violations in recent U.S. election history,” Mr. Page said on CNN. Mr. Page was investigated last year for his connections to Russian officials, and his name was in the leaked dossier concerning the Trump team’s ties to Russia. The FBI recently obtained a warrant for Mr. Page’s communications after leaving the Trump campaign, arguing there was enough probable cause to obtain the warrant. “There is no probable cause, and there could be no probable cause based on anything I’ve ever done with Russia or any Russian person,” Mr. Page said. He said he has not been more forthcoming with information because of his concerns of breaking confidentiality. “I don’t like to discuss confidential dealings. I don’t want to create any issues for people,” Mr. Page said. President Trump and the administration have denied Mr. Page had any direct contact with Mr. Trump and was not a formal adviser to the campaign. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/kelly-wright-black-fox-news-anchor-sues-race-discr/
Fox woes continue as Kelly Wright, black anchor, sues for race discrimination ANALYSIS/OPINION: Fox News is on a rolling, plunging, rocky ride of late, with all the sexual harassment allegations, suits, settlements, claim and the rest — and now, this. Black anchor Kelly Wright has joined a handful of former and present staffers accusing the cable outlet of racial discrimination. He’s the only black male anchor at Fox; he announced his intent to file separate charges during a press conference with his attorney, Doug Wigdor. He also announced he was joining the separate race discrimination suit filed by a dozen other plaintiffs against Fox, alleging race discrimination as well. “This hurts,” Wright said, the Blaze reported. “This hurts. I am here reluctantly because I prefer sitting behind an anchor desk delivering news to you, the viewer — reporting, delivering the news. … I am here reluctantly because I am not against any man or woman at Fox News. The truth is I admire, I like and even love the people who I work with and for. But I don’t like what they do.” Gulp. Here comes the stunner. Wright first made clear that he’s not joined forces with any left-wing organization to try and take down Fox. He also added his belief that Fox would continue to grow and thrive, due in large part to the millions of watchers who trust in the company mission. And then this: “But when that trust is broken with various employees because of racial bias, something has to be done.” So what’d Wright personally experience at Fox that met the criteria, he believed, for racial discrimination? Wigdor stepped in to explain. “Mr. [Bill] O’Reilly would not permit Mr. Wright to come on his show to discuss how America could focus on achieving racial reconciliation in the midst of growing racial hostility,” the attorney said. “Instead, Mr. O’Reilly told Mr. Wright that he should call up Roger Ailes and Bill Shine and offer to sing the national anthem at the Fox News town hall. Rather than viewing Mr. Wright as the two-time Emmy award recipient he is, Mr. O’Reilly saw Mr. Wright as a singing entertainer.” Wright was later asked to appear on O’Reilly’s news talk show to discuss the Ferguson, Missouri, racial upsets and divide. At that time, Wright asked O’Reilly to show “Beyond the Dream,” a series of stories about positive contributions blacks have made to their communities. “Mr. O’Reilly refused because it showed blacks in too positive a light,” Wigdor said, the Blaze reported, “declaring that he, Mr. O’Reilly, knew black America better than anyone.” Fox has denied the allegations in Wright’s suit, as well as the charges contained in the previous race discrimination suit filed by a dozen other plaintiffs.And the company, through a spokesperson, vowed to “vigorously defend these cases.” Woe is Fox, though. And woe are conservatives across the country who have watched with growing alarm the seeming endless allegations of sexual harassment against big names at the one outlet that used to represent the free-market, small-government side of arguments — and now this.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/trump-to-give-nra-speech-after-gun-rights-support/
Trump to be first president since Reagan to personally address NRA convention Gun rights activists rallied to candidate Donald Trump in ways unprecedented in modern politics, and as president Mr. Trump is about to repay them with a personal speech this week at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention. He becomes the first sitting president to appear since Ronald Reagan, and Second Amendment advocates say they are likely to give him a hero’s welcome, praising the change in attitude at the top of the administration, the Supreme Court pick of Justice Neil Gorsuch and other moves. “If I had to grade him based upon everything that’s on his plate that he has to deal with, I’d have to give him an A,” said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. “There’s no doubt that he calmed the fears of gun owners around the country that the federal government [will] be used as a tool to take their constitutionally protected rights away. I mean, there’s no two ways about that.” The NRA, in somewhat of a surprise move, endorsed Mr. Trump at its convention last year — months before he formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination. The group was one of Mr. Trump’s largest outside backers in terms of TV air support and advocacy. It marked a stunning turnaround for Mr. Trump, who in 2000 said he supported stricter firearms controls, then turned into one of the fiercest opponents of those controls as a presidential candidate. “This president ran as the most pro-Second Amendment, pro-individual freedom candidate in the history of the country, and if you look at how he’s governed over the first 100 days, he’s arguably been the most effective and most successful in the first hundred days of any presidency,” Chris Cox, the head of the NRA’s lobbying arm, said in a recent appearance on Fox News. More than 80,000 NRA members are anticipated at this year’s convention in Atlanta. In addition to Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke are also slated to address the NRA Institute for Legislative Action’s leadership forum on Friday. But Mr. Trump is undoubtedly the main attraction, and his appearance at the conference sends a solid message to gun owners, said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “He courted gun owners, and sometimes you get courted by politicians and then once they’re elected you’re” forgotten, Mr. Van Cleave said. “The fact that he’s going to the convention is just one more indication that when he’s saying something, he means it.” Gun control groups are just as energized and are vowing to oppose Mr. Trump at every turn. They are organizing a rally in Atlanta for Saturday, the day after the president’s expected speech. The groups said they are preparing to try to stop NRA-led initiatives such as national reciprocity for concealed-carry permits obtained in one state. “The extremist leadership of the NRA spent $30 million for a seat at the table in the White House, and they are doing everything they can to get a return on that investment,” said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights backers have big hopes for Mr. Trump, though early efforts have been modest. The president did sign into law a repeal of Obama-era regulations that would have required the Social Security Administration to scour its records for people with mental deficiencies and who were deemed unable to handle their finances and flag them as potential dangers who must be blocked by the national background check database. Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, applauded Mr. Zinke’s move to lift an Obama-era ban on using lead ammunition on certain federal lands. “President Trump has done more for gun rights in his first 100 days than any president in recent memory,” Mr. Pratt said. “Moving forward, we hope that whatever Obamacare ‘fix’ he pushes, it will prevent insurance companies, doctors and the ATF from furthering a gun control agenda.” Gun rights groups spent much of the past eight years trying to derail attempts by Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats to impose further restrictions on gun purchases, to expand background checks to cover personal sales or trades and to limit ammunition magazine capacity. But Americans, fearful of harsher restrictions, rushed to stock up, setting purchase records in what became known as the Obama gun boom. Early evidence suggests that the buying spree has been curtailed with Mr. Trump in office. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/drugged-driving-more-prevalent-fatal-car-crashes-d/
Drugged driving more prevalent in fatal car crashes than drunk driving: Report Drivers killed in fatal car crashes are now more likely to be on drugs than drunk, according to a report published Wednesday, prompting its authors to demand lawmakers “do something” about the uptick of drug-related casualties. Fewer drunk drivers were killed in automobile accidents in 2015 than drivers who tested positive for drugs, the Governors Highway Safety Association and the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility said in Wednesday’s report. Forty-three percent of drivers tested after fatal crashes that year had drugs in their system, compared to 37 percent who tested above the legal limit for alcohol consumption, the report said, citing data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System, FARS. “We have new data that show drugs are more prevalent to drivers than alcohol is for the first time,” Jim Hedlund, a former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official and author of the report, told CBS News. Of the drivers killed with drugs in their system, 36.5 percent tested positive for marijuana, according to the data. Amphetamine, or speed, was the second-most prevalent at 9.3 percent. “We have a drug crisis in this country. I think that’s clearly evident and it’s impacting traffic safety,” Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the GHSA, told West Virginia’s Metro News. According to the report’s authors, the findings show a clear and present need for law enforcement to detect and deter drugged driving. With drivers experimenting with hundreds of different drugs, however, police continue to wrestle with understanding the affects of various substances in addition to identifying the signs and symptoms of subsequently induced impairment. “Officers need to know more than they do for alcohol how to suspect drug impairment, and know that it can exhibit itself in different ways,” Mr. Hedlund told the Duluth News Tribune. “Drug impairment has different signs and symptoms — think of the difference between uppers and downers. “As states across the country continue to struggle with drug-impaired driving, it’s critical that we help them understand the current landscape and provide examples of best practices so they can craft the most effective countermeasures,” Mr. Adkins said. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is illegal in all 50 states. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/allergy-season-worsens-as-result-of-climate-change/
Climate change is torturing allergy sufferers For local nasal allergy sufferers, the damp, rainy weather over the past couple of days has been a respite from high levels of tree and flower pollen. But with temperatures continuing to rise year to year, longer spells of warm weather mean increased pollen counts and a prolonged allergy season for the future. “Washington, D.C., is one of many, many cities in the central and southern and eastern U.S. that have one of their warmest years, starts to the year on record,” said Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist for Weather.com and The Weather Channel. Mr. Erdman said the general consensus is that with a warming climate over the next several decades, pollen season will lengthen across much of the country. “We get more carbon dioxide in the air that makes plants more efficient at producing pollen and growing faster,” he said. “This is just one of the things we’re going to have to deal with going forward.” Researchers estimate that about 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from nasal allergies, which affect as many as 30 percent of adults and 40 percent of children, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Pollen from blooming trees — particularly birch, oak and cedar — is the culprit for nasal allergies in the spring; ragweed is the leading contributor to hay fever in the fall. Across the U.S., spring arrived about three weeks earlier than typical, according to data from the USA National Phenology Network, a research consortium on seasonal phenomena. And researchers are trying to evaluate how warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels affect the environment and humans. A 2010 report by the National Wildlife Federation asserted that “unchecked global warming will worsen respiratory allergies,” more airborne allergens will increase asthma attacks and poison ivy “grows faster and is more toxic” with increased levels of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, scientists have recorded stabilized global emissions of carbon dioxide between 2013 and 2015 — a promising trend, considering that CO2 levels in 2013 surpassed 400 parts per million, the highest amount ever recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 20 million Americans over the past year diagnosed with rhinitis, or hay fever, our bodies’ rejection of pollen in the air. Symptoms include sneezing, runny nose and red, watery eyes — a nuisance for many, but they can develop into serious respiratory infections for an unlucky few, especially children. The CDC counted 7.4 million children with respiratory allergies in the past 12 months. And data from the National Health Survey from 1997 to 2011 show that respiratory allergies are the most common type of allergy among children. For Dr. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Virginia, it’s not the uptick in new allergy cases that worries her but the increased severity of allergies in patients she already sees. She has noticed a trend in her patients needing multiple medications to control their symptoms. “Kids are requiring a lot of medication for their allergies, the kids that I’m seeing now, there’s not many of them that can be treated with one medication, most of the kids I’m seeing are requiring two, three or four medications to control their allergies,” Dr. Ahdoot said. She noted the case of one boy who was recently prescribed an inhaler and already was four other medications including a nasal spray, an oral antihistamine and an inhaled steroid. He had to be prescribed an oral steroid. Dr. Ahdoot is a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a member of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. The consortium warns that climate change negatively affects humans’ health. “Some kids have minor sniffles and is not a big deal,” Dr. Ahdoot said. “But some have significant nasal congestion, eye irritation and itching that makes them quite miserable. They get sent home from school, have to go to the doctor’s, can’t play outside, and have to take multiple medications.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/oregon-rose-parade-cancelled-after-radicals-threat/
Oregon rose parade canceled after radicals threaten to oust Republican celebrants An annual community parade in Oregon has been canceled after radicals threatened to shut down the event unless the local Republican Party was banned from participating. Organizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade in East Portland received an anonymous email urging them to bar the Multnomah County Republican Party, or “we will have two hundred or more people rush into the parade into the middle and drag and push those people out.” The 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association issued a statement Tuesday saying that it could “no longer guarantee the safety of our community and have made the difficult decision to cancel the parade originally scheduled for Saturday, April 29, at 9:30 a.m.” “The related Carnival at Eastport Plaza is also canceled,” the association said. “We are deeply disappointed that the agendas of these outside groups have so regrettably impacted East Portland and the 82nd Avenue community.” The threatening email, sent by thegiver@riseup.net, referred to previous protests and warned, “You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely.” The subject line was, “Don’t make us shutdown the parade.” The Direct Action Alliance, which had organized an event on Facebook called “Defend Portland from Fascists at the Avenue of Roses Parade,” said it was “disappointed” by the cancellation, but that “we will always defend our community.” The anonymous alliance said that “known members of neo-Nazi and anti-immigrant hate groups planned to attend the event,” but it did not specify what that meant. “[W]e intended to stand between them and those who they wanted to intimidate. We intended to block out their hate and shut down their violence,” said the alliance. Prior to the cancellation, Multnomah County Republican Party Chairman James L. Buchal had urged the mayor and police in a letter to identify the leaders of the radical group and “take steps to prevent their proposed criminal conduct.” He said the local party had participated in the 11th annual parade for years and expected hundreds of its members to attend. “The road to fascism begins with armed gangs of thugs using violence to shut down opposing points of view,” Mr. Buchal said in a Tuesday statement. “The question now is whether the city of Portland will be complicit in such conduct. We hope the city’s new leadership has the courage to respond to these threats appropriately.” The locally run parade is among many events timed to the annual Portland Rose Festival. “The Rose Festival is saddened to learn that this wonderful community event, in one of Portland’s most culturally enriched neighborhoods, has been canceled due to the ongoing political divisiveness in our country,” spokesman Rich Jarvis told KOIN-TV.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/christopher-steele-admits-dossier-charge-unverifie/
Ex-spy admits anti-Trump dossier unverified, blames Buzzfeed for publishing Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the infamous anti-Donald Trump dossier, acknowledges that a sensational charge his sources made about a tech company CEO and Democratic Party hacking is unverified. In a court filing, Mr. Steele also says his accusations against the president and his aides about a supposed Russian hacking conspiracy were never supposed to be made public, much less posted in full on a website for the world to see on Jan. 10. He defends himself by saying he was betrayed by his client and that he followed proper internal channels by giving the dossier to Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, to alert the U.S. government. SEE ALSO: Inside the court case of Christopher Steele's Trump dossier Mr. Steele has not spoken publicly about his disputed opposition research project, but for the first time he is being forced to talk in a London court through his attorneys. Barristers for Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence firm filed their first defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by Aleksej Gubarev, chief executive of the network solutions firm XBT Holdings. Mr. Steele acknowledges that the part of the 35-page dossier that identified Mr. Gubarev as a rogue hacker came from “unsolicited intelligence” and “raw intelligence” that “needed to be analyzed and further investigated/verified.” Democrats in Washington have embraced the unproven dossier as an argument for appointing a high-powered commission to investigate President Trump and his aides. In his final December dossier memo — his 16th — Mr. Steele accused Mr. Gubarev and his web-hosting companies of hacking the Democratic Party computer networks with pornography and bugging devices. Mr. Gubarev calls the charge fiction and filed a lawsuit in February. Mr. Steele’s court filing portrays him as a victim of Fusion GPS — the Washington firm that hired him with money from a Hillary Clinton backer. Fusion specializes in opposition research for Democrats and circulated the Steele dossier among reporters in an effort to injure the Trump candidacy and presidency. Mr. Steele said he never authorized Fusion to do that. “The defendants did not provide any of the pre-election memoranda to media organizations or journalists. Nor did they authorize anyone to do so,” Mr. Steele said through his attorney. “Nor did they provide the confidential December memorandum to media organizations or journalists. Nor did they authorize anyone to do so.” “At all material times Fusion was subject to an obligation not to disclose to third parties confidential intelligence material provided” by Mr. Steele and his firm Orbis, the court filing reads. Mr. Steele personally signed the seven-page filing. He is represented by two London barristers who specialize in defamation cases: Gavin Millar and Edward Craven. Mr. Steele says the ultimate responsibility lies with BuzzFeed, the liberal news website whose editor, Ben Smith, decided to post the entire 35 pages — memos from June to December — on Jan. 10 even though Mr. Smith said he doubted the far-flung accusations were true. That momentous web posting sent Mr. Steele into hiding. He re-emerged March 7 in London, made a brief statement to the press and went inside his Orbis office. The Steele dossier’s major charge is that the Trump campaign entered into an elaborate conspiracy with Russian agents to hack Democratic Party computers. The Trump White House denies the charge, as do at least four people whom Mr. Steele’s unidentified sources accused of breaking the law. The final Steele memo in December targets Mr. Gubarev and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney. That memo, after accusing Mr. Gubarev, then recounts from previous memos a supposed trip Mr. Cohen took to Prague in late August to meet with Russian agents and devise a plan to cover up the purported Trump team’s role in the hacking. Mr. Cohen calls the dossier “fabricated.” He has shown that he was in California at the time and has never been to Prague. He told The Washington Times that he has instructed his attorneys to investigate a lawsuit against Mr. Steele. The fact that Mr. Steele acknowledges that he put unverified “raw intelligence” into his December memo casts further doubt on his research techniques for the entire 35-page dossier. Although Mr. Steele portrays himself as a victim of Fusion and BuzzFeed, he acknowledges in his court filing that he provided “off-the-record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda in late summer/autumn 2016.” The narration of the involvement of Mr. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, reads like a spy novel. Andrew Wood is a former British ambassador to Moscow and is an associate at the Orbis firm. After the Nov. 8 presidential election, Mr. Wood met with Mr. McCain and David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state who is director of human rights and democracy at The McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University. By that time, Mr. Steele had written 15 memos for the dossier. As a result, Mr. Wood arranged for Mr. Kramer to meet with Mr. Steele “in order to show him the pre-election memoranda on a confidential basis,” the court filing says. The meeting occurred on Nov. 28 in Surrey, England. “Mr. Kramer told [Mr. Steele] the intelligence he had gathered raised issues of potential national security importance,” the court filing says. Mr. Kramer returned to Washington, and Fusion agreed to give a hard copy of the dossier to Mr. McCain “on a confidential basis via Mr. Kramer,” according to the filing. Mr. McCain then asked Mr. Steele, through Mr. Kramer, to provide any additional information on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence officially has concluded that Russia directed a hacking operation into Democratic Party email servers and orchestrated the release of stolen emails via WikiLeaks to help the Trump campaign. Mr. McCain has confirmed publicly that he personally turned over the dossier to FBI Director James B. Comey. But at that time, the FBI already had obtained the dossier from other sources and had been using it to investigate the supposed Trump-Russia connection. Afterward, Mr. Steele continued to receive “raw intelligence,” including the Gubarev accusations. He wrote the December memo after his work for Fusion had ended. He provided that memo to British national security officials and to Fusion through an “enciphered email,” with instructions to provide a copy to Mr. McCain. The court filing says Mr. Steele has worked with Fusion for “a number of years” and was hired in June to begin investigating Mr. Trump. It was in June when the Democratic National Committee disclosed publicly that it had been hacked and its cybersleuths singled out Russia as the likely culprit. Mr. Steele does not mention another American contact he made: The New York Times reported that the FBI, during an October meeting in Rome, offered him $50,000 to continue investigating Mr. Trump. Presumedly, Mr. Steele would continue to investigate the president as a surrogate for the FBI. The deal, however, did not go through. Some Republicans have questioned why the FBI would try to put a Democratic-paid opposition researcher on the payroll, especially one who produced a dossier that remains unproven. The Times said the FBI wanted Mr. Steele to provide more proof of his charges. Mr. Gubarev also is suing BuzzFeed for libel in Florida, where XBT has an office and where his firm Webzilla is incorporated. The lawsuit calls BuzzFeed’s posting “one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern journalism.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/most-murders-occurred-in-5-percent-of-countys-says/
Most homicides in U.S. occurred in 5 percent of counties, says study The homicide rate may be rising in some U.S. cities, but slayings are still a localized phenomenon, with most U.S. counties not seeing a single homicide in 2014. The vast majority of homicides occurred in just 5 percent of counties, and even there the murders were localized, with some neighborhoods untouched by the violence, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Crime Prevention Research Center. “I just think most people have a real misunderstanding about how heavily concentrated murders are,” said John R. Lott Jr., the author of the study. “You have over half the murders in the United States taking place in 2 percent of the counties.” President Trump vowed in his inaugural address to end “American carnage” in the nation, especially in crime-ridden inner cities, and the report offers more data points that depict a distinct urban-rural divide in the U.S. About 70 percent of the counties, accounting for 20 percent of the U.S. population, had no more than one murder in 2014, with 54 percent of counties experiencing zero murders, the report found. Meanwhile, 5 percent of the counties, which made up nearly half the population, accounted for more than two-thirds of murders in the country, with the highest numbers concentrated in areas around major cities like Chicago and Baltimore. Those results shouldn’t be entirely surprising, as other factors like poverty and human activity are also concentrated, said David Weisburd, director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. “All of these issues are factors behind why one place has more of something than the other,” Mr. Weisburd said. But even within cities, the divide was stark in certain regions. Los Angeles County saw a high number of homicides in 2014, but there were “virtually no murders” in the northwestern part of the county, the study found. It also found that in Washington, D.C., whose 105 murders put it in the top 20, the vast majority occurred in the eastern part of the city and that the area around the U.S. Capitol was “extremely safe.” Mr. Weisburd said that in his studies of larger cities, about 1 percent of the streets produce 25 percent of the crime and about 5 percent of the streets produce 50 percent of the crime. “It’s almost exactly the same concentration in New York, Tel Aviv, Cincinnati, Sacramento,” he said. Factors that account for such micro-differences can include population density, the number of employees on a given block, and even arterial roads in the area, Mr. Weisburd said. “So already, you could say that if you build an apartment building in a street and you have a 7-Eleven or other kind of store that [is] employing people and it’s on an arterial road, you ought to be ready [to] try to keep crime down there,” he said. One difference in the county-by-county numbers was that gun ownership was heaviest in rural and suburban areas where there were few murders, Mr. Lott said. “It has to do with lots of things. I don’t want to push it too far,” he said. “But the thing is, it’s still just striking.” “The places where we see the murders tend to be those area[s], the urban areas, and even tiny areas within those areas, where legal gun ownership is itself relatively rare,” he said. Other recent studies have shown that the U.S. murder rate is being driven to a large degree by the prevalence of such incidents in a relatively small number of cities that have seen a recent spike. Baltimore, Chicago and Houston accounted for about half of the increases in homicides in major cities between 2014 and 2016, according to a recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice. The report also found that murders spiked in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., in 2015 before declining in 2016. “There are some local spikes that are concerning, but the numbers simply don’t back any claims of a national crime wave,” said Ames Grawert, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Justice Program and an author of the recent analysis. Mr. Trump frequently has singled out Chicago, the unofficial hometown of his predecessor, as a prime example of the problem. In January, the president threatened to “send in the feds” if Chicago couldn’t fix the “horrible ‘carnage’” going on in the city. The Trump administration also has threatened to take away certain funding for “sanctuary cities” like Chicago that generally look the other way on illegal immigration, though a federal judge on Tuesday ruled against an executive order that had aimed to block the funds. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said Tuesday that the Trump administration has been sending a “confusing” message when it comes to federal involvement in preventing violence. “This administration can’t call itself a ‘law and order’ administration and then do something like cut the funds for violence prevention when police chiefs across America say that is just wrong,” Mr. Durbin said in a Senate floor speech.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/donald-trump-eyes-conservatives-for-court-vacancie/
Trump prepares to seat Judge Thapar, first of scores of conservatives for federal courts Fresh off his successful Supreme Court battle, President Trump will now try his luck stocking the federal appeals court with conservative jurists — and Democrats are mostly powerless to stop him. First up is Judge Amul R. Thapar, whom Mr. Trump has tapped to sit on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and who will sit for his confirmation hearing in the Senate on Wednesday. Progressive activist groups are preparing for a fight, saying Judge Thapar has several controversial rulings on his record. But Senate Democrats said they have yet to examine Judge Thapar’s nomination and haven’t revealed a strategy for him or for the rest of Mr. Trump’s federal court nominations going forward. Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat, pointed to other picks he said were higher priorities for the Senate to tackle. “I hope we will get to a process of considering nominees for the Justice Department, for the State Department, where in those case where we can quickly come to an agreement, we’ll process them so the government can function,” said Mr. Coons. “And in those cases where there’s reason for sharp disagreement, we’ll continue to stand firm against those who aren’t qualified to serve.” Mr. Trump has an opportunity to reshape the federal judiciary. Circuit courts need nominees for 19 vacancies, and district courts are waiting to fill more than 100 vacancies, but the White House has been slow to announce names. Part of the reason for the slow pace is that the Senate has been consumed with the fight over Justice Neil Gorsuch. The justice was confirmed this month — but only after Democrats mounted a filibuster, forcing Republicans to use the “nuclear option” shortcut to change the rules. Use of the filibuster won’t be an obstacle for the lower-court picks, either, because Democrats used the nuclear option in 2013 to defang the procedure for all non-Supreme Court nominees. A committee aide said Democrats will insist that the Senate respect the “blue slip” tradition, which gives senators a chance to approve judicial picks from their home states. If both senators don’t return their blue slips, nominations traditionally are scuttled. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has also signaled that she will ask the committee to wait for evaluations by the American Bar Association before nominees get confirmation hearings. The Trump administration has said it won’t wait for an ABA rating before making its nomination, breaking with the practice of the Obama administration. Progressive groups, which pushed the nuclear showdown over Justice Gorsuch, say they still want Democrats to test Judge Thupar. “Hopefully, the Senate confirmation hearing tomorrow will illuminate his views and what type of judge he will be on the 6th Circuit,” said Dan Goldberg, legal director for the progressive Alliance for Justice. “We intend, after the hearing, to certainly further educate the full Senate on Judge Thapar’s record.” Mr. Goldberg said Judge Thupar was on the list of potential nominees that Mr. Trump released last year as a presidential candidate. Democrats said the list was suspect because it was crafted with help from conservative legal advocates. Mr. Goldberg also said Judge Thapar has issued troubling rulings, including opposing campaign ethics rules for judicial candidates in Kentucky that would have limited their contributions in partisan politics. Judge Thapar was later reversed in part by the 6th Circuit — the court for which Mr. Trump has nominated him. Mr. Goldberg also said Judge Thapar rejected a family’s lawsuit against a jailhouse nurse who they claimed had acted indifferently to their family member’s medical needs. The family member died of diabetic ketoacidosis while in jail. Conservative groups were skeptical of Democrats’ appetite for another bruising fight over judges. “It’s not Supreme Court stakes at this point, and the Democrats have to go in recognizing that Judge Thapar is someone who will easily be confirmed,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. She said Judge Thapar is a “stellar nominee” and is particularly strong on safeguarding constitutional limits for all branches of government — including the courts.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/sean-spicer-san-francisco-sanctuary-cities-have-bl/
White House: Sanctuary cities have ‘blood of dead Americans on their hands’ The White House lashed out Tuesday night against the federal judge who blocked President Trump’s anti-sanctuary city executive order, and said sanctuaries like San Francisco have “the blood of dead Americans on their hands.” Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the ruling by Judge William H. Orrick misconstrued U.S. immigration laws and undercuts Americans’ faith in government. “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” Mr. Spicer said in a scorching statement. “But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the United States.” The statement was all the more striking because it conflicted with the Justice Department’s take on the case. Department spokesman Ian D. Prior said rather than blocking Mr. Trump, the key part of Tuesday’s ruling actually endorsed the administration’s current approach to sanctuary cities. Judge Orrick, who sits in San Francisco, ruled that Mr. Trump overstepped his bounds by trying to impose new restrictions on federal grants issued to states, counties and cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation agents. The judge said Congress, not Mr. Trump, has the power of the purse and gets to decide what strings are attached. Judge Orrick issued an injunction against part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order threatening to withhold potentially tens of billions of dollars from sanctuary cities. But the judge said in instances where Congress has already approved strings — such as three Justice Department programs — Mr. Trump can withhold the money. The Justice Department said those programs — the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, COPS funding and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program — were the ones they had planned to target anyway. Mr. Spicer, though, appeared to read the decision as blocking, not empowering, enforcement of that part of the law. He delivered a withering attack on Judge Orrick, and attacked Santa Clara and San Francisco, the two counties in California that had sued to halt Mr. Trump’s executive order. “San Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the well-being of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands,” Mr. Spicer said. San Francisco became the chief target in the sanctuary city debate after the 2015 slaying of Kate Steinle. The man standing trial for her killing is an illegal immigrant shielded from deportation by the city’s policies. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/24/michael-cohen-may-sue-buzzfeed-christopher-steele/
Trump’s lawyer launches legal action against BuzzFeed for publishing ‘completely fabricated’ dossier Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s personal attorney, says he has instructed his own attorney to investigate legal action against BuzzFeed, which posted an opposition research “dossier” that accused Mr. Cohen without proof of a conspiracy with Russian agents. Mr. Cohen told The Washington Times that he also is considering a lawsuit against former British spy Christopher Steele, who wrote the gossipy 35-page dossier that the liberal news website posted on Jan. 10. Mr. Steele was paid by a Hillary Clinton supporter, via the Democratic Party-linked firm Fusion GPS, to gather dirt on candidate Trump last summer and fall. GPS circulated the Steele memos to reporters and Democrats. SEE ALSO: King says he hasn’t seen evidence of Burr ‘slow walking’ Russia investigation But it was not until BuzzFeed posted the dossier that some people named in it learned that they were accused of wrongdoing. In Mr. Cohen’s case, Mr. Steele accused him of traveling to Prague in the last week of August to meet with Russian agents to devise a plan to cover up the supposed Trump-Russia hacking of Democratic Party email servers. Mr. Cohen, the attorney for the Trump Organization for 10 years, immediately denied the accusation in January. He showed his passport to the president, his close aides and reporters to prove he had never been to Prague. He also shared his itinerary for a trip he took to Southern California at the time Mr. Steele said he was in the capital of the Czech Republic. Mr. Cohen is not alone in challenging Mr. Steele. Aleksej Gubarev, CEO of network solutions firm XBT Holding, is suing for defamation. The dossier said he ran a hacking operation to flood Democratic computer networks with porn and bugging devices. Mr. Gubarev, a tech entrepreneur, called the charges “one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern ‘journalism,’” according his libel lawsuit, which was filed in Florida state court. BuzzFeed Editor Ben Smith said he doubted the dossier was true at the time it was posted. His news site responded to the lawsuit by apologizing and striking Mr. Gubarev’s name from its website dossier, but the pages already had been copied and widely circulated. Mr. Cohen’s name remains unredacted. The charges against him continue to swirl in social media even though he has shown that the Prague meeting could not have taken place. In a statement to The Washington Times, Mr. Cohen said: “I believe the entire dossier to be inaccurate, and worse, completely fabricated. I applaud Aleksej Gubarev in bringing legal action against both Christopher Steele and BuzzFeed for creating and disseminating this fake dossier/information without a scintilla of fact checking. I am currently in discussions with foreign and domestic counsel to file similar actions.” The Steele dossier mentions Mr. Cohen more than a dozen times but on just one topic: his supposed trip to Prague to meet with Russians and cover up the supposed Russia-Trump hacking. “The agenda comprised questions on how deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the Clinton campaign and various contingencies for covering up these operations and Moscow’s secret liaison with the Trump team more generally,” Mr. Steele wrote. His final memo in December stated: “In Prague, Cohen agreed [to] contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operations, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary Clinton won the presidency. It was important in this even that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that a cyber and other operators were stood down/able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces.” Again, Mr. Cohen said this account by Mr. Steele is fiction. He never attended such a meeting. If Mr. Cohen follows through with a lawsuit, he would be following a path paved by Mr. Gubarev in February in Florida state court against BuzzFeed and Mr. Smith, and in a London court against Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence. XBT, which operates more than 37,000 computer servers globally, has an office in Florida, where its web development company Webzilla is incorporated. Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Gubarev, 36, who left Russia in 2002 to live in Cyprus and launch tech companies, was recruited “under duress” by the FSB, Russia’s follow-on to the Soviet KGB spy service, to hack Democrats’ computers with “botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data.” Mr. Gurbarev’s lawsuit, filed by Boston attorney Evan Fray-Witzer and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney Brady J. Cobb, says the Steele narrative is “wholly and completely false.” “Although BuzzFeed and Smith specifically knew that at least portions of the dossier were untrue, they printed the entire document — without meaningful redactions — including those portions that falsely accused the Plaintiffs of participating in an alleged conspiracy to commit crimes against the Democratic Leadership, not to mention a conspiracy to undermine American Democracy and the 2016 election,” the action states. “BuzzFeed and Smith published these allegations without having even taken the most basic step of contacting the Plaintiffs to ask if the allegations had any merit,” it says. “As a result of BuzzFeed and Mr. Smith’s reckless publication of defamatory materials, he has found his personal and professional reputation in tatters.” Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Gubarev used a hacker by the name of Seva Kapsugovich. Mr. Gubarev says he doesn’t know and has never met Kapsugovich. McClatchy News reported that Kapsugovich is a twice-convicted pedophile who has been imprisoned in Russia in a facility where he has no access to the internet or cellphones. The lawsuit says Mr. Smith assigned four reporters to the dossier to try to prove or disprove it, yet none of them contacted Mr. Gubarev. The lawsuit against Mr. Steele was filed in London by the international law firm McDermott Will & Emery. It says the dossier caused Mr. Gubarev to lose clients all across Europe and that Mr. Steele made no effort to contact Mr. Gubarev. “It has caused [Mr. Gubarev] serious financial loss and is likely to do so in the future,” the lawsuit says. Mr. Steele gave interviews to journalists whom he tried to persuade to produce stories about his dossier, the lawsuit says. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/democrats-mark-100-days-of-resistance/
Democrats seeking revenge prepare to mark 100 days of ‘resistance’ For Democrats, the Trump administration has offered a chance for payback. Still sour over the way Republicans treated President Obama, the Democratic minority has one word to describe its strategy toward President Trump: resistance. “There is a difference between obstruction, which is what congressional Republicans engaged in in the early days of the Obama administration, and resistance, where Democrats have been opposed to policies that would be detrimental to the American people,” said Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries of New York, a newly minted member of the House Democratic leadership team. “Resistance is anchored in defending your policy priorities that are consistent with your perspective, but being willing to work with the other side of the aisle when policies are proposed, that would be good for America,” he said. Mr. Trump marks his 100th day in office on Saturday having faced unwavering opposition to his agenda from Democrats. They have erected the worst delay of Cabinet picks in U.S. history, mounted a filibuster of his universally acclaimed Supreme Court nominee, fought his efforts to rewrite Obamacare and prompted investigations into his administration’s dealings with Russia. They also have cheered from the outside — and occasionally assisted with legal briefs — as the federal courts have blocked Mr. Trump’s immigration plans. The anti-Trump sentiment has become so ingrained in the Democratic mindset that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi struggled to come up with an answer Thursday when asked if she had something positive to say about the president’s first 100 days. The California Democrat instead talked about Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter. “I was thinking he was more of a creature that stalked the night, that these things just came out at night like a vampire, that he tweeted these things,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “But now it’s spread to the morning. So let me think for a while.” Democrats came out on the losing end of the November elections, ceding control of the White House and failing to win the House or the Senate — the latter of which had seemed within reach in the waning days of the campaign. As they pick up the pieces, Democrats have concluded that their path back to power relies not on finding common ground but rather on fighting Mr. Trump at every turn, save for the few issues where he agrees with them. “I think our caucus and the party as a whole after the election and the loss to Trump went through a whole defining period: Who are we?” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, Arizona Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “I think what has occurred now is that at least in this caucus now in the House, I see more unity than I have ever seen before. There is some common purpose.” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York set the tone before Mr. Trump was sworn in. “If the president-elect proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure and trade and closing the carried interest loophole, we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it, but when he doesn’t, we will resist,” Mr. Schumer said in his first address to the chamber as the Democratic leader. Mr. Schumer’s stance marks a stunning reversal. He used to criticize House Republicans for being beholden to the right-wing tea party movement, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, says it’s now Mr. Schumer who is beholden to his left flank. Mr. McConnell said that has led to “just delay for delay’s sake.” Progressives, though, say they want to see still more obstruction. They forced Democrats to filibuster Justice Neil Gorsuch, which Senate Republicans countered with the “nuclear option,” altering the rules and making it easier for Mr. Trump to get more nominees to the high court. Unbowed, liberal activists say the energy of the fight was worth it. They say Democrats can win by channeling the anti-Trump energy, sending a clear message that the Democratic Party is united after a nasty presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders. “I’m telling right now, the Democratic Party, there is a new spirit y’all,” Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the vice deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told progressive activists this week. “It is not the same old thing.” Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a progressive group, said the public is behind the resistance. “I think it is pretty significant that the first 100 days of his presidency there has not been a significant bill passed,” said Mr. Chamberlain, adding that Democrats will have little incentive to change their tactics unless Mr. Trump starts to deliver on the promises he made to working-class voters. “It seems like it is just a fantasy to discuss a situation where Democrats should be willing to work with him,” he said. “When you think about the future, the future is continued opposition. It is strong opposition.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its candidate recruitment for the midterm elections next year is off to a good start. “The amount of top-tier candidates already stepping forward to run for Congress this early in the cycle is very encouraging,” said Tyler Law, DCCC spokesman. “There’s no question that we’re seeing a huge uptick in energy at a time when Democrats are on offense across an expanded battlefield.” For now, Democrats have had to take solace in moral victories. They touted the 7 percentage point loss they suffered in a special election race in a deep-red congressional district in Kansas as a win and are playing up Democrat Jon Ossoff’s chances of winning a June runoff race in Georgia — though many political observers say Republican Karen Handle is the favorite. On Capitol Hill, Democrats celebrated this week after Mr. Trump backed off his demand for funding for a border wall in a short-term spending bill that lawmakers are trying to hash out to avoid a government shutdown. That concession still wasn’t enough for Mr. Schumer. He said Thursday that he would block the stopgap bill. Democrats also cheered on the more conservative elements of the Republican caucus that sunk the White House’s opening bid to repeal and replace Obamacare. Asked about the performance of his party over first 100 days of the Trump administration, Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said, “It is still a work in progress.” “We are in a special position here as the minority — not only a minority, but a superminority with the House and the Senate, and obviously with the presidency [in Republican control],” he said. “So our ability to initiate, to actually demand things on the floor is more than limited — it doesn’t exist. “So I think the standard of success is completely different from that of the majority,” he said.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/one-week-stopgap-bill-pushed-fund-keep-government-/
GOP lawmakers push one-week stopgap bill to prevent government shutdown House Republicans introduced a short-term spending bill late Wednesday that would avoid and end-of-week government shutdown and buy seven more days’ time to finalize a full 2017 spending deal. If the one-week extension passes it means the government will have operated on stop-gap funding for more than seven months of the year. The current funding expires at midnight Friday. The new bill would extend funding through May 5, averting a partial shutdown that would ensue without any more money in the pipeline. SEE ALSO: Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill “This continuing resolution will continue to keep the government open and operating as normal for the next several days, in order to finalize legislation to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year,” said Rep. Rodney Frelinguysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Negotiations on the full 2017 bill hit snags earlier this week when Democrats insisted on including controversial Obamacare money and President Trump insisted on initial funding for his border wall. Mr. Trump eventually dropped his wall demands, and Democrats on Wednesday relented on their Obamacare demand after the administration made clear it wouldn’t unilaterally halt payments.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/6/mainstream-media-loses-its-mind-over-susan-rice/
An epidemic of TDS in the Marx Bros. media ANALYSIS/OPINION: Just about the time the fever on the nut left seems to be subsiding there’s another outbreak of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Normal-looking folk who sound like they escaped a Marx Bros. movie fall into a relapse. The bombshell that Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s chief source of intelligence, was guilty of “unmasking” Trump campaigners identified in intelligence findings, unhinged several commentators on the television networks. Colleagues and bystanders couldn’t decide whether to call security or medics. The Chicken Noodle Network demonstrated why it has fallen on hard times, saying it would not report bad news about its favorite political personalities. “Let us be very clear about this,” said Don Lemon, one of CNN’s star news readers and part-time house dick. “There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team was spied on illegally. There is no evidence that backs up the president’s original claim. And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you [with] a diversion.” Mr. Lemon’s viewers who want to know would have to go to another channel for another investigator. At MSNBC, the leading television network on Planet Pluto, Chris Matthews was more than willing to talk about the bombshell but first he had to find someone to help him get a grip. The bug that crawls up his leg when he thinks about Barack Obama was biting again. When he thought about it, he was sure that the Rice bombshell, with the implication that whatever U.S. intelligence sources had picked up about the Trump campaign had been passed on to the Insurrection, was fake news the new president was pushing to distract attention from the investigations into contacts, if any, between Mr. Trump and the Russians. “Why is [the president] going after Susan Rice?” he demanded of no one present. “It’s like he pulls out — he’s like an old [disc jockey]. He pulls out old records from 20 years ago and plays them again.” Then he played video clips from three Republican senators — Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — raising questions about Miss Rice’s behavior, and read a tweet from Mike Huckabee speculating about Susan Rice in an orange prison jump suit. Sen. Cotton called her Typhoid Mary, for showing up every time there was a scandal or shame in the Obama administration. “Oh, God,” cried David Corn, a guest panelist. “I mean,” said Chris, “Huckabee has no shame. These guys are trooping along, like camp followers of Trump.” Piped up another guest, one Simon Marks: “They’re looking for a pinata. They found one in Susan Rice. I do think — “ Chris allows no thinking on his show, so he cut him off in midsentence. “Notice it’s a female. Just a thought.” (Only Chris is permitted an occasional random thought.) “Well, said Simon Marks, trying to get back in the conversation, “that’s true. That’s also true. But I do think she slightly played into her hand — into their hands. “Typhoid Mary?” asked Chris. Well, no. Mr. Marks was talking about Susan Rice. Chris does not always pay attention when someone else is talking. He interrupted again. “Susan Rice’s job is to watch national security,” Chris said, apparently unaware that Susan Rice hasn’t had that job since America changed presidents. There’s not only a new president, but a new adviser with the job of “watching national security.” But then Chris wanted to talk about the movies. He suggested that Susan Rice, or maybe it was Tom Cotton or Mike Huckabee, he wasn’t sure, had been living in the Bates Motel, with a deranged killer from the famous Alfred Hitchcock movie “Psycho.” Chris watches a lot of movies and sometimes has trouble keeping the characters straight. Then it was off for a history lesson. The Trump family, particularly First Daughter Ivanka Trump Kushner, reminds him of the Romanovs, the Imperial Russian family slain by revolutionaries in 1917. Trump Derangement Syndrome apparently encourages fantasies about assassinations. A columnist for The Washington Post seemed to observe not long ago that assassinations often put an end to unhappy eras. Treating Trump Derangement Syndrome is not easy. Dr. Quackenbush, the celebrated physician would tell you that we must be patient, because there will be episodes of intense derangement, and then the affliction subsides, only to flare again. The confirmation this week of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to unhinge Chris, David and Don again. Dr. Quackenbush, who achieved celluloid immortality in the Marx Brothers movie “A Day at the Races,” was trained to doctor horses, and he would know which end of Chris and the guys to examine. If only he were here. • Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Remember when the establishment thought Trump was crazy? ANALYSIS/OPINION: Remind me again: Who is the impulsive, trigger-happy pugnacious brute who cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes? It’s Donald Trump, according to universal bipartisan proclamations from establishment Washington lifers who broke into such hysterics over a gauche real estate titan who thought he could do their job better than them. These people should know, considering they are the same people who have managed to keep America at a constant state of war for about 15 years now. These people cannot agree on pretty much anything else. But spending gobs of money policing the world with never-ending foreign wars? They suddenly break out in hot pulsating bipartisanship. So perhaps it should come as little surprise that these people who so loathed Donald Trump the candidate are so thrilled with Donald Trump the president for firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian civil war that American voters are pretty adamant about staying out of. The sudden applause for Mr. Trump came from the strangest corners of the political world. The Senate’s “renegade” rogue Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham — ardent foes of Mr. Trump during the campaign — commended him for his warrior bluster. “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,” they said. “For that, he deserves the support of the American people.” Even Sen. Marco Rubio — famously dubbed “Little Marco” — cheered the president for “acting decisively.” “President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,” Little Marco said. Across the aisle, even Democrats were gushing over the expensive military intervention. “Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer enthused. Even Hillary Clinton hopped aboard the Trump Train for bombing Syria. Her only complaint seemed to be that Mr. Trump may not have gone far enough. “I believe that we should have, and still should, take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them,” she said. This is the same Hillary Clinton who warned us in the most alarming terms during the campaign that under no circumstances should Mr. Trump be trusted with America’s war-making arsenal. “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she said last summer. “It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” Well, apparently Syrian dictator Bashar Assad got under Mr. Trump’s very thin skin, and Mrs. Clinton’s only complaint now is he didn’t go far enough. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/4/melania-trump-official-portrait-sparks-liberal-out/
Melania Trump’s official portrait sparks liberal outrage ANALYSIS/OPINION: Trump Derangement Syndrome is real, folks. The latest example is the liberal reaction to first lady Melania Trump’s official portrait, which was unveiled on Monday. Cosmopolitan Magazine declared the photo was heavily airbrushed — Cosmo, of all sources, which heavily airbrushes many of its scantily clad cover models every month. Mrs. Trump’s face “appeared to be heavily airbrushed,” the women’s magazine lamented, adding a bit of snark: “This soft lighting is like only the classiest ‘90s mall glamour shot photo could offer!” Wire service Agence France-Presse reported: “Melania Trump portrait stirs controversy,” which was then carried and featured on the front-page of Yahoo News on Tuesday. “While some commenters gushed that the first lady was ‘beyond beautiful’ and ‘gorgeous,’ others mocked the image as highly airbrushed and compared the gauzy background — a window in the White House residence — to 1990s school portrait settings,” AFP reported. Former Comedy Central “The Nightly Show” writer Sasha Stewart wrote on Twitter, “Anyone know why Melania Trump’s portrait was taken in front of the Muppet Babies window?” The Hollywood Reporter took offense Mrs. Trump wore her wedding ring in the picture. “Melania Trump’s official White House portrait puts her 15-carat wedding ring front and center,” its headline blared, adding: “Compared to Michelle Obama’s first official portrait first portrait, which shows the former first lady in the now-famous sleeveless Michael Kors dress in the Blue Room of the White House in 2009, Melania’s portrait has an almost surreal glow about it, not unlike a mall glamour shot. The air of perfection, however, might just be a result of her prior experience as a professional model. We’ll never know.” The U.K.’s Daily Express also took note of her ring, saying she was “flaunting an ENORMOUS diamond ring” and “chose to flaunt her wealth, power and status in her first official portrait as First Lady.” You know what I think? So what? The picture’s gorgeous, and her ring is beautiful. She and her husband made no secret of their wealth when Mr. Trump ran for office, so why are we shocked now? There’s no reason. Unless you’re looking to nitpick. Unless you detest Mr. Trump and his presidency so much, nothing is off limits, including his criticism of his wife. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome. And unfortunately, I think it’s an incurable disease for many in the media. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/buying-illegal-drugs-is-immoral/
Why buying illegal drugs is immoral ANALYSIS/OPINION: Purchasing illegal drugs is an immoral act, regardless of where one stands in the legalization debate. When drugs are legally prohibited, criminal organizations assume control of production and distribution, making violence inherent in the process. Drug proceeds are used to fund criminal and terrorist organizations, enabling them to murder innocent people, attack police and military, bleed our tax dollars, and destroy the rule of law. Drugs are a major source of income for terrorist groups and other criminal organizations, due to the high profit margins in these illegal markets. For example, one kilogram of heroin costs $2,500-$5,000 in Afghanistan and it sells for $60,000-$90,000 in the United States. That same kilogram is worth approximately $1.5 million after is it diluted and divided into individual dosage units. Profits made from illegal drug sales are also unreported income, allowing unlawful enterprises to remain in the shadows. There is a strong nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism. According to DEA’s FY2016 Performance Budget Congressional Submission, 22 of 59 designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations had possible ties to drug trafficking. This number is probably low, because evidence is difficult to obtain, and it doesn’t address two recently designated terrorist groups. As an example, Afghanistan produces most of the world’s opium, morphine, and heroin. In Afghanistan, drug producers, traffickers, and transporters have deep connections to the Taliban, Haqqani network, and other terrorist groups. Drug traffickers use terrorists for protection and terrorists use drug traffickers to fund their activities. Terrorism is not the only violence associated with drug trafficking. Criminal groups regularly commit crimes against humanity. For example, Mexican organized crime was responsible for an estimated 80,000 deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to a Congressional Research Service report on Mexican Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Organizations. Violent, transnational criminal gangs, such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) also fund their criminal activities through drug trafficking. Violence is inevitable in illegal activity, especially in businesses like drug trafficking that involve large sums of money. Criminal groups exist outside of the judicial system; therefore they have no recourse with police or in the courts when they are victimized by other groups. When a criminal group retaliates against another, it engages in forms of tribalism and anarchism, where justice is determined by those most willing to use force. Drug dealers become modern warlords, operating outside of accepted institutions and societal norms. Drugs are not the only unlawful trade that should be avoided. For example, illicit cigarette trafficking in the United States has been linked to terrorism funding. Numerous criminal investigations have shown that profits from some illicit cigarette sales support terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda. The Iran-backed Hezballah, which was designated by the U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997, has links to both untaxed cigarette sales and drug trafficking. Hezballah, which is also supported by Iran, is responsible for terrorist activities across the globe. While there are compelling arguments to legalize certain drugs, the policy argument needs to be divorced from the morality of purchasing illicit drugs. It’s ironic that many celebrities and public intellectuals call for boycotts against corporations, like Nike and Apple, because of the low pay and poor working conditions these companies offer workers overseas, but some of the same people also openly admit to buying marijuana illegally. They don’t see the hypocrisy of condemning businesses, while buying marijuana from Mexican drug cartels or heroin from the Taliban; both of which murder innocent people. They mistakenly justify the purchase of illegal drugs based on their belief that drugs should be legalized, while ignoring the fact that their actions subsidize murder. The next time one considers buying illegal drugs, one should consider that the money might be going to Hezballah, the Taliban, or a drug cartel. If one believes a specific drug should be legalized, then one should encourage legislators to change the law, not violate the law. Until the law is changed, illegal drug purchases will continue to support evil men who commit acts of violence against the innocent. • Jeffrey James Higgins is a retired DEA supervisory special agent, with 25 years of law enforcement experience, and an expert in narco-terrorism.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/gun-misinformation-harms-fair-debate/
Challenging inaccurate information about guns ANALYSIS/OPINION: When you receive glowing media attention and have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, you don’t really have to debate. Michael Bloomberg just announced last week that he would be putting $25 million into next year’s House and Senate races. From 2013 to 2016, he donated $48 million toward congressional races. By contrast, the NRA contributed a measly $2.1 million. And Mr. Bloomberg spent about 85 percent more on lobbying, more on television advertising, and much more for state and local political races. Mr. Bloomberg’s groups, like other gun control organizations, usually have control over whom they debate on TV and radio. I know this from personal experience. On a half dozen occasions, I have been asked to appear on CNN or elsewhere, only to be canceled on because the representative from Mr. Bloomberg’s group didn’t want to appear with me on the show. I have even been told this as I was driving to the studio. All that the producers could give me was their sympathy. A couple of them even asked me if I could recommend someone to replace me. In April 2015, C-SPAN’s Washington Journal invited me to participate in a one-hour debate with Ted Alcorn, research director at Mr. Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety. Mr. Alcorn had already agreed to appear, but said he was unavailable as soon as the C-SPAN producer informed him of my participation. He said something had come up. When the producer suggested that the two of us could appear in separate, half-hour segments, his availability changed once again. However, he was only available for the half-hour segment after mine. Conveniently, that prevented me from responding to his points. I learned all of this from the C-SPAN producer, who encouraged me to let viewers know about Mr. Alcorn’s unwillingness to debate me. From the show transcript: Lott: “I was really disappointed that the people from Everytown — your producer said that I should mention this — weren’t willing to go on with me right now to discuss this. I think that the audience would gain a lot more from the give and take, where someone could make a claim, and the other person could rebut it. I am disappointed that they have continually refused to appear at the same time.” When Mr. Alcorn finally appeared on “Washington Journal,” the first caller asked him about his unwillingness to debate. Caller: “my first comment is that I think it is quite telling that the people who are opposed to gun rights refuse to appear on screen with Dr. Lott or other economists or criminologists … why is that?” After responding with a long discussion about how we “live in a moment when gun rights in the U.S. have an unprecedented level of protection,” Mr. Alcorn eventually got to his point. Alcorn: “When there’s a credible scientist — somebody who wants to have a real constructive conversation about this, we’re going to be there. But folks who seek to minimize the issue of gun violence, the grave issue of gun violence in this country or to draw attention away from the real issues to themselves — that’s not a conversation that I think is productive to be a part of.” I don’t minimize the issue of gun violence. I just disagree about what policies will effectively combat that violence. But Everytown can afford to make excuses and miss opportunities for debate. After all, they have massive resources and can count on the mainstream media to push their agenda. In my experience, only Fox News has stood its ground. Once more, Everytown refused to participate as soon as they learned that I would be appearing at the same time. But the show went on, and host John Stossel pointedly mentioned their unwillingness to participate. On literally hundreds of occasions, however, gun control advocates have refused to have a straight-up debate. Last November, popular Las Vegas talk show host Alan Stock tried to set up a debate about Mr. Bloomberg’s ballot initiative in Nevada on gun background checks. But a person working on the campaign reportedly told Mr. Stock that they would “only debate a local person who didn’t know as much about the issue.” Last month, the prestigious, bipartisan Texas Lyceum invited me to debate gun control issues. They asked Everytown, the Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center if they would participate. Once again, they refused. Mr. Bloomberg and his groups are unwilling because they don’t want viewers to see their inaccurate information being challenged. They would rather people just take their falsehoods at face value. • John R.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/donald-trump-immigration-agenda-remains-in-flux/
Donald Trump’s conflicting messages ANALYSIS/OPINION: One hundred plus days into his topsy-turvy presidency, Donald Trump and his administration are sending conflicting messages about the agenda he ran on in his 2016 campaign. In many cases, he appears to be backing away from the hard-core positions that appealed to his legions of cheering supporters who catapulted him into the White House. In recent weeks, President Trump and his advisers have abandoned key components of his plan to deport millions of illegal Hispanic immigrants, suggesting that many or even most of them will remain in this country. His campaign pledge to build “an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,” seems to be crumbling among Republicans on Capitol Hill. And it is now clear that his endlessly repeated promise to make Mexico pay the tens of billions of dollars the wall would cost to build isn’t worth the paper it was printed on. Instead, he’s pleading with Congress to include a billion dollar down payment in the 2017 federal budget that is now being taken up in the House. Meaning that taxpayers will foot the entire bill. Conservative talk show firebrand Rush Limbaugh, who was one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest supporters throughout his campaign, isn’t happy with the president’s flip-flop on this issue. Mr. Trump was “caving on his demand for a measly $1 billion in the budget for his wall on the border with Mexico,” Mr. Limbaugh told his radio audience this week. His switchboard lit up with angry phone calls. “I’m afraid he’s starting to dip his foot into the swamp,” said one caller. Another said he feared that Mr. Trump would just continue to “kick this can down the road.” Meantime, Republican congressional leaders are no longer talking about building a 2,200 mile wall. Instead, the talk is all about beefing up security along the border with drones and other surveillance gear and personnel. Even Mexico’s president Felipe Calderon is now saying nice things about Mr. Trump’s increasingly softer tone on the border issues. “I believe that the current administration after 100 days has been more moderate than was expected,” he said. “And I think we need to reinforce such behavior.” Mr. Trump ran flat out by repeatedly condemning China as a “currency manipulator,” but now says that designation no longer applies to them. He preached “America First” in his campaign, a political cry in World War II from Americans who opposed our entry into the war, urging that we retreat from institutions like NATO that he said had become obsolete. And he was critical of corporate welfare programs like the Export-Import Bank. But now he opposes Republican efforts to abolish the Ex-Im bank and stoutly defends membership in NATO, saying that a muscular Europe is “very, very important to me as president of the United States” and “very much to everybody’s advantage.” Perhaps nowhere is the administration’s backtracking more surprising, and confusing, than the growing internal debate about whether illegal immigrants, other than those who have committed crimes, should be deported. That debate has centered on “dreamers,” illegals who were brought here when they were very young by their parents. Many are now nearing their 20s and some are either attending colleges or expecting to enter soon. They come under the protective Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA program enacted under President Obama. In an interview with The Associated Press last Friday, Mr. Trump appeared to support the “dreamers” program, saying they should “rest easy” and not be concerned about deportation. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked about the president’s remark on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, he said, “There’s no doubt the president has sympathy for young people who were brought here at early ages.” But when the program’s host, George Stephanopoulos, asked if Mr. Trump’s remark meant that they could remain in the country, Mr. Sessions said this: “Well, we’ll see. I believe that everyone that enters the country unlawfully is subject to being deported. However, we’ve got — we don’t have the ability to round up everybody, and there are no plans to do that.” Mr. Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly went even further in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. These people were here “unlawfully,” he acknowledged, but added, “we are not targeting — my organization has not targeted these so-called dreamers, DACA.” Then, in a stunning turnabout, Mr. Kelly addressed the broader immigrant community: “If you are simply here illegally, we don’t really have the time [to] go after you. We’re looking for bad men and women.” The president made many dubious promises in his campaign, but now he’s having trouble with another wall, constructed by our Founding Fathers, and made up of three, totally independent branches of government. They were designed to deal with the very situations we face today in the Age of Trump. • Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/conservative-journalists-have-different-take-on-tr/
Talking right ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Trump did something Monday I have long advocated. He met with a small group of conservative journalists, pundits and radio talk show hosts. I was among them. After ticking off a list of what he said were his accomplishments leading up to the arbitrary 100-day marker of his presidency, we asked him questions. What differed from the crowd of liberal journalists who ask questions during formal news conferences — and those who toss questions at his spokesman, Sean Spicer, at the daily press briefing — is that our group asked questions with the intent of getting information, instead of the accusatory tone and “gotcha” questions that often characterize what has come to be known as the mainstream media. The session was supposed to be on “background,” meaning the president could not be quoted, but halfway through he declared it on the record, which is how news broke of his decision to impose a 20 percent tariff on Canadian lumber entering the United States. Mr. Trump said it is “unfair” for the Canadian lumber industry to receive government subsidies. Reciprocity, he called it, “a word I like.” The questions were substantive, including mine about North Korea (“Given your stated budding friendship with China’s President Xi Jinping and what you say are his efforts to dissuade North Korea’s nuclear program, would you say war is less likely, or about as likely?”) The president said he doesn’t discuss military matters in public, but in his answer to my follow-up question he said he’s not sure some of the armaments recently paraded through the streets of Pyongyang are real, “but we’ll see.” Conservatives should not be lapdogs for a Republican president. No one asked the types of softball questions the media usually toss at a Democratic president. The president told us he doesn’t expect to be free of criticism, but appreciates fairness. He allowed that conservative journalists are likely to be fairer to him than those his strategist, Steve Bannon, has called “the enemy” and “opposition party.” A side note: Mr. Bannon stood off to the side at our meeting with the president, frequently smiling. Evidence that the major media tilt left is undeniable. The Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog organization, has calculated that during the first 30 days of his presidency “the president and his team were the subject of 16 hours of coverage on just the Big Three evening newscasts, or more than half (54 percent) of all of the news coverage during this period. And while most new presidents enjoy a media honeymoon, the tone of Trump’s coverage was nearly as hostile (88 percent negative) as we found during last year’s presidential campaign (91 percent negative).” The New York Times on Tuesday provided a useful service. It carried a story noting how differently conservative and liberal reporters and commentators have treated Mr. Trump and his administration. Reading these suggests not just different perspectives, but different realities. The mini news conference ended with a promise by a White House staff member that there would be more of these gatherings. They seem to be an outgrowth of Sean Spicer’s strategy to broaden media access beyond the usual collection of liberal journalists and even beyond Washington, as he does with occasional questions via Skype from reporters and anchors in other cities. Most of these have also been substantive and reflect issues and perspectives from outside the Washington Beltway. While some reporters have groused about this exercise in ideological pluralism, the public is getting more information and a different perspective than what they are used to. That can only be good for the country, for conservative journalists who are often ignored by the major media, and for the president. • Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/go-donald-trump-go-pare-back-the-national-monument/
Go, Trumpm go — pare back the national monuments ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Donald Trump is taking aim at some of Barack Obama’s national monuments — most notably the ridiculously large Bears Ears 1.3 million acre set-aside signed into being in Utah last December — as well as at designations made by other presidents during other administrations. And this is great news. Terrific news. When it comes to the country’s national monuments, this White House’s attitude should be one of slash and burn — not conserve and preserve. Let’s be real here. Obama’s 12th-hour Bears Ears National Monument declaration was not about protecting land, saving properties from future destruction, preserving our country’s historical records or artifacts. It was about sticking it to the Constitution, that little piece of paper Obama used mostly for Kleenex. And it was about thumbing his nose at the states — mostly Republican states — that had previously maintained control of some of these public properties (which is just another way of sticking it to the Constitution, the 10th Amendment). Believe it or not — and truly, most people these days fall into the latter category of “not,” primarily because that’s where political conditioning has led — the Constitution really does address private property rights and really does provide protections for land- and business-owners. One such protection can be found in the Fifth Amendment, the section that reads: “nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” That means the government can’t simply grab private property or affix so many regulatory restrictions on the property that it becomes virtually useless — that it becomes the subject of a regulatory taking. Courts, and the Antiquities Act of 1906, have since eroded the concept of the Fifth Amendment, however. The Antiquities Act was established by Congress as a means of protecting those public properties seen as historically, culturally and scientifically significant to America — properties like the Grand Canyon, for instance. And it was established primarily as a means of stopping the widespread acts of vandalism that destroyed or degraded several of the countries’ notable properties. The logic? That the federal government, better than the states or even private sectors, could manage and oversee these lands. In other words: The Antiquities Act was never supposed to be a means of controlling the population, of scoring political points, of rewarding special rights, of catering to radical interests or of advancing progressive-socialist ideals. But that’s what it’s become. That’s what Obama’s lame-duck and Republican-opposed naming of 1.35 million acres as federally protected and managed Bears Ears land was. That’s what Bill Clinton’s 1996 Republican-opposed naming of 1.9 million acres of Grand Staircase-Escalante land as a national monument in southern Utah was. And there are scores more that could be listed — scores more by presidents from both political parties that came in the face of widespread opposition from political officials, gaming groups, hunters, recreational vehicle clubs, fishers, miners and business- and private property groups. But the main point is this: The declaration of national monuments by our nation’s presidents has gotten way out of control. And the fact that Trump’s willing to take a look at some of these properties and give them a second look to see if hey, maybe they can be scaled back a bit, or even outright removed from the federal program, is a very happy day for those who’ve watched the growth of the federal land management hand with alarm. Specifically, Trump’s issued an executive order for dozens of national monuments declared over the past 20 or so years to be reviewed. Among: Bears Ears and Grande-Escalante. Happily, the review may also include recommendations for Congress to reform the Antiquities Act and make it a bit tougher for a president, unilaterally, to restrict human use on such massive swaths of land. As Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said: “[This order will restore] the trust between local communities and Washington.” Quite right — so long as the review leads to real action. And when the environmental and conservation groups sue? Let ‘em. They’re already crying about the fact the Antiquities Act doesn’t allow for properties to be removed from federally protected status — only added. Well, here’s a thought on that: Who makes the rules? Right. The same people who created the rules that allowed the properties to be protected in the first place. Saying the rule makers can’t change the rules they made — by doing their rule-making jobs — is ridiculous. It’s just a ploy to halt the fight before it even begins. Besides, we’re not talking about turning over the federally managed lands to housing developers. We’re talking about coming up with options that reel in the heavy fed presence — options that could include turning the properties to the states to manage, dwindling the boundaries to more manageable levels, putting some land in the control of public-private sectors, etc. What’s wrong with that? So to repeat, let the leftists sue. This administration is pretty handy on the ‘ol court circuit. And this time, it looks like Republicans in Congress and at the state level are on the same policy track as Trump — the one that says with the Antiquities Act, maybe less is more.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/obama-iran-nuclear-deal-showing-little-effectivene/
Tangled in Obama’s Iran nuclear trap ANALYSIS/OPINION: On April 18, the State Department certified Iran to be in compliance with its commitments under the Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). As France’s iconic foreign minister, the Marquis de Talleyrand, once reportedly said: “This was worse than a crime; it was a mistake.” The applicable statute not only did not require such a certification, it openly invited President Trump not to make one if circumstances warranted, as they clearly did here. More seriously, the certification raises fundamental questions whether the State Department’s bureaucracy knows or cares that U.S. Iran policy has changed with the Trump administration’s advent. The applicable reporting statute requires that, at least every 90 days, the president must determine whether he “is able to certify” that among other things, “Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements,” and that “Iran has not taken any action, including covert activities, that could significantly advance its nuclear weapons program.” By the explicit terms of the reporting obligation, the president (whose authority had been delegated to the secretary of State) was required only to decide whether he could avow Iran’s full implementation of its JCPOA obligations. He was not required to make a binary choice, either certifying that Iran was complying or that Iran was not complying. He could have sidestepped, especially given his administration’s short time in office and its ongoing review of Iran policy, not to mention what we know about Iran’s violations just from publicly available information. Of course, one consequence of not certifying compliance is that the reporting statute also provides for expedited legislative consideration of new anti-Iran sanctions legislation. That may have been the bureaucracy’s motivation, but, given Mr. Trump’s clear views on the Iran deal, could hardly have affected the White House view. How could such a mistake have been made? Perhaps because of a significant challenge facing Mr. Trump, namely avoiding becoming entangled in a bureaucratic trap set by his predecessor. In critical respects, President Obama negotiated the JCPOA to be inherently unverifiable. The vaguely written and internally contradictory text of the agreement, with language invariably favorable to Iranian interpretations that would subvert its ostensible intent, is the opposite of how arms agreements should be written. This is no surprise, because a verifiable nuclear agreement was not what Mr. Obama wanted. Instead, he sought a political agreement with Tehran that would neither require Senate approval nor be easily terminated by subsequent administrations. Given that objective, a tightly written, readily verifiable agreement with which Iran never had any intention of complying would have been an obstacle rather than an aid. Equally troubling were steps taken during Obama’s administration to lessen the State Department’s capacity to determine compliance with all international arms-control agreements. In 1999, a remarkable bipartisan coalition led by Sens. Jesse Helms and Joe Biden, over the Clinton administration’s vigorous objections, created in the State Department a Bureau of Verification and Compliance (VC). The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in its report on the legislation creating VC, rejected the Clinton State Department’s proposed “demotion of verification and compliance functions” by putting them under the assistant secretary for arms control. Noting “a true commitment to vigorous enforcement of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and sanctions cannot be maintained by submerging compliance analysis within other bureaus,” and given “the inevitable tension between enforcement of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and the implications of enforcement with various countries,” the VC assistant secretary was to provide the essential independent voice on verification and compliance matters “at the most senior level of the Executive Branch.” VC was never accepted by State’s arms-control bureaucracy. When Mr. Obama took office, his appointees immediately and effectively downgraded VC. Knowing that repeal of the Helms-Biden legislation was politically impossible, the Obama administration instead merged VC into State’s arms-control bureau, creating the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. The verifiers were thereby all but silenced. In fact, the merger essentially recreated the situation that had given rise to the Helms-Biden legislation in the first place. As a result, there was no institutional check on the Obama administration’s desire to get a deal with Iran at any cost, particularly when it came to verification. As assessed in the Sept. 2, 2015 Letter of Experts to Mr. Obama, verification of the JCPOA, is “completely ineffective.” Thus, the very bureaucracy that negotiated the deal now gets to assess Iran’s compliance. In addition to the vagueness of many of the JCPOA’s terms, the agreement expresses many Iranian commitments as being voluntary, based on Iran’s “plans.” For example, “Iran will abide by its voluntary commitments, as expressed in its own long-term enrichment and enrichment R&D plan to be submitted as part of the initial declaration for the Additional Protocol to Iran’s Safeguards Agreement.” That is, after Iran’s nuclear program is declared to be peaceful in eight years. Candidate Trump called the JCPOA “the worst deal ever negotiated.” Now, the State Department personnel who helped John Kerry ensure it was a U.S. diplomatic Waterloo will be free to color the Trump administration’s review of their work. President Trump and his team should urgently address this critical deficiency, or with absolute confidence, we can predict it will return to bite them again. • John R.

The anatomy of a Trump decision ANALYSIS/OPINION: When Donald Trump’s Florida lawyer Paul Rampell first proposed turning the future president’s Mar-a-Lago estate into a private club, Mr. Trump pronounced the idea “dumb.” Over the next month, Messrs. Rampell and Trump argued back and forth about the idea until Mr. Trump finally agreed with Mr. Rampell. What happened in between provides an anatomy of how Mr. Trump makes decisions and gives insight into what sometimes seems like chaos in the Trump White House. Mr. Trump bought Marjorie Merriweather Post’s 114-room 1927 estate for $5 million in 1985. A white elephant, the estate cost $1 million a year to maintain. By 1991, Mr. Trump wanted to subdivide the estate’s 20 acres into lots. He consulted Mr. Rampell, who argued that the best use of the property would be a private club. Mr. Trump derided the idea, saying it sounded like a Studio 51, a nightclub that would not be attractive in Palm Beach. Mr. Rampell said that unlike a nightclub, club members could dine and celebrate weddings and other occasions. Mr. Trump could create a spa facility, add tennis courts, and provide beach services. Mr. Rampell, who is Jewish, said that unlike some of the other private clubs in Palm Beach, the club would admit Jews and blacks. Mr. Trump countered that no one would want to join the club if it did not have a golf course. Mr. Rampell said other clubs in Palm Beach without golf courses do just fine. On and on the argument went. After meeting with Mr. Rampell in person at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump called him almost every day over the next month, sometimes speaking with him several times a day. As he does in the White House, Mr. Trump consulted a range of other people. He told Mr. Rampell that friends who are in real estate told him the idea would never work. Several other lawyers also threw cold water on the idea. In determining legal strategy, Mr. Rampell says, Mr. Trump consults a number of lawyers, then makes up his mind. Often no one can guess the outcome until Mr. Trump announces his decision. In canvassing different opinions, Mr. Trump does not necessarily limit himself to experts. I remember when my wife Pamela Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter, and I flew down with Mr. Trump to stay at Mar-a-Lago as part of the research for my 1999 book “The Season: Inside Palm Beach and America’s Richest Society.” Mr. Trump drove Pam and me in his Durango SLT to a $2.5 million waterfall being built at his new Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach. Trump had to decide what color rocks to use. He liked the whiter ones, but he asked Pam and me and the workmen which color we preferred. We all liked the reddish ones, so Mr. Trump went with them. In the days leading up to his 2017 New Year’s Eve party, when I chatted with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago about problems in the Secret Service and other matters, he asked my opinion on Israeli settlements and the two-state solution. I know as much about the Middle East as Mr. Trump knows about the Talmud, but I gave my opinion. Indeed, that was the way Mr. Trump first learned about Mar-a-Lago, chatting with his limousine driver and asking about properties for sale. “Trump constantly canvasses opinions from people around him, even security guards or housekeepers,” Mr. Rampell, who has turned down over 100 requests for interviews about Mr. Trump, tells me. “It was fun to argue with him,” he says. “He would use these great New York expressions like “Fuggetaboutit” and “Are you outa your mind?” When Palm Beach Town Council members opposed turning Mar-a-Lago into a club and later tried to impose crushing restrictions on it, Mr. Trump enlisted Mr. Rampell to use the carrot and the stick. Mr. Trump believed that the prejudice of Palm Beach Town Council members, some of whom belonged to clubs that discriminate to this day, was in part behind their opposition to his plan to turn the estate into a private club that would not discriminate. Mr. Rampell sent DVDs of “Gentleman’s Agreement,” a movie about anti-Semitism in the 1940s, and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” about anti-black prejudice, to the mayor and to each of the town council members. Guided by Mr. Rampell, Mr. Trump invited members of the town council to play golf or tennis with him. He invited them to parties with beautiful young women at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Rampell helped raise money for one council member’s campaign and let her use his office for phone banks. Mar-a-Lago opened as a club in 1995. The club makes a profit of $15.6 million a year. The property, which fronts on both sides of the 3.75-square-mile island, is worth an estimated $300 million. If Mr. Trump consults a wide circle of people before making decisions, he is also loyal to them. One day, Mr. Rampell opened the door of his Palm Beach home to find an expensive computer from Mr. Trump for his son’s birthday. Mr. Rampell later learned that Mr. Trump had gone shopping for it himself and delivered it himself. “He is very open-minded and has a humanitarian side to him that people don’t see,” Mr. Rampell says. “He will pay off people’s mortgages and hospital bills. At the same time, he is willing to take risks. Other lawyers told him the town would never approve Mar-a-Lago. He went ahead against long odds.” • Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, is the author of “The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents” (Crown Forum).

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/government-shutdown-can-still-be-avoided/
Ending the threats of a government shutdown ANALYSIS/OPINION: We are looking at another potential federal government shutdown this week. The high drama over passing a budget, passing spending bills under regular order, and the lifting of the debt ceiling has gone on for far too many years. Congress and the White House should be able to at least complete the basics of governing smoothly or be forced to do so by risk of a personal penalty or fine. The three triggers for punishing members of Congress should be related to the three most basic parts of their job — passing a budget, funding the federal government under regular order, and managing the debt status of the United States. The personal fine on members of Congress would have to be very severe and must be immediate. Make members of Congress cut their own wrists before they pull the life support from the American people by not passing critical legislation when due. I strongly believe they will rush to find common ground at least among their own party members, ignore those who are hopelessly opposed to doing so, and pass aforementioned legislations on time. It must not wait until Election Day. The record would show that the vast majority of the members of Congress do not fear elections with many not having a serious challenger in decades and others could not be beaten by Mother Teresa, if she registered with the opposition party, due to political gerrymandering and historical trends. The American people want our Congress to do its job. And that takes 535 members and the White House working together. I was an elected official for more than a decade with most of that time as a member of Congress from the great state of Connecticut. I’m Republican — and I go way back. I can remember meeting President Reagan in the White House as an elected official. I was the first black conservative elected to Congress, and I was the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in nearly 60 years back in 1990. It is my belief that the most skilled members of Congress are the ones who are able to work with other members to help their constituents, state and nation. Voters can only reward you so much for “trying and failing” — and today, Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. There are no excuses. Achievements are what warrant praise. Giving your supporters false expectations or overpromising would slowly come to an end. Everyone understands that Rome was not built in a day. It often takes small steps to truly make a positive difference. The more steps taken, the closer you get to your goal. It took a while for Congress to get to this point. Eliminating earmarks stripped the party leadership of a large amount of its strength. The expanded use of gerrymandering in congressional districts created more polarization and has made it very difficult to beat an incumbent. Thus, there are little consequences for a person’s actions. On the rare occasions when a member of Congress is defeated, they are frequently replaced with a person more to the left or right. To achieve nothing is not an achievement. That is why the approval ratings for Congress have been so low over the years. We should fine all the members of Congress and the president if they are unable to do the basic parts of their aforementioned jobs and eliminate the anywhere, anytime threat of removal of a speaker. We would have a much smoother running federal government. (To affect Congress it would only take a rule change). How hefty should the fine be to get their attention and how should it be done to ensure fairness? After all, some members are multimillionaires and a fine too small would cause them to ignore it. On the other hand, some members are living month to month from their paycheck, and you do not want the fine to be too crippling for those folks. The solution is to make it a percentage of their adjusted gross income (AGI) from their most recent federal tax return. This would make it fair. Make the fine equal to 10, 15 or 20 percent of their AGI payable to a nonprofit like the United Way of America. The result — gridlock is over. Politicians would learn not only to work with others who have different views but they will also learn to manage the expectations of their constituents. Those who are the best and the brightest will shine in such an environment and the American people would benefit the most. • Gary Franks is a former Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Connecticut.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/2020-election-could-be-another-1972-for-democrats/
Will 2020 be another 1972 for Democrats? ANALYSIS/OPINION: Forty-nine years ago, Vice President Hubert Humphrey was the Democratic candidate for president. The year 1968 was a tumultuous one that saw the assassinations of rival candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. Lyndon Johnson’s unpopular lame-duck Democratic administration imploded due to massive protests against the Vietnam War. Yet Humphrey almost defeated Republican nominee Richard Nixon, losing the election by just over 500,000 votes (43.4 percent to 42.7 percent). Infighting Democrats could have defeated the unpopular Nixon if not for a few unforeseen developments. Their convention in Chicago turned into a creepy carnival of televised rioting and radical protests. Hippies and leftists were seen battling police in the streets on prime-time news. The former Democratic governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ran as a states’ rights third-party candidate and drew 13.5 percent of the vote. Wallace destroyed the Democrats’ traditional hold on the old “solid South” by winning five Southern states outright. He also siphoned off enough traditional Democratic supporters to give Nixon astonishing Republican victories in half-a-dozen other states in the region. Nixon won over a few Northern blue-collar states that had often voted Democratic, such as Wisconsin and Ohio — again with help from Wallace, who appealed to fed-up, working-class Democrats. What was the lesson from 1968? The Democrats could have recalibrated their message to appeal more to working-class voters. They should have rebuilt the old Franklin D. Roosevelt-era coalition that had elected Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, mostly by appealing to paycheck issues and avoiding radical agendas. Yet despite picking up 12 House seats in the 1970 midterm elections, and instead of attributing the 1968 loss to Wallace’s third-party populism and voter pushback against radicalism, the Democrats went off the rails and veered hard left in 1972. The lowering of the voting age to age 18 in 1971 also tricked Democrats into wrongly thinking that most new young voters were leftists and would vote in record numbers for leftist candidates. So the Democrats in 1972 foolishly nominated die-hard left-wing South Dakota Sen. George McGovern. Although President Nixon wasn’t a popular political figure, he was busy unifying voters by moving all over the political map. The wily, flexible and pragmatic Nixon talked hard-right but actually moved to the center. He created the Environmental Protection Agency. He vastly expanded the welfare state and pushed for universal health care. Nixon also had imposed wage and price controls, and visited Communist China. Nixon ridiculed conservative icons such as California Gov. Ronald Reagan and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. as right-wing troublemakers and elitist ideologues. In other words, Nixon was as controversial — and as politically unpredictable and misunderstood — as Donald Trump. The November 1972 election proved one of the biggest Republican landslides in American history. Nixon was re-elected with more than 60 percent of the popular vote, winning 49 of 50 states. Democrats held on to Congress only because sober Democratic senators and House members up for re-election never followed the far-left trajectory of McGovern. Democrats would remain out of the White House until 1980, when Jimmy Carter ran a winning Humphrey-like campaign as a centrist populist outsider from the South. Will the 2020 end up like 1972 for Democrats? So far, the similarities are eerie. Hillary Clinton lost the election but won the popular vote over Mr. Trump. Had she campaigned more in the so-called “blue wall” states of the Rust Belt and Midwest, and not stupidly labeled a quarter of the country “irredeemable” and “deplorable,” Mrs. Clinton may have won in the Electoral College as well. As in 1968, the future lesson from the lost 2016 election was for Democrats to appeal more to working classes — and not to pander on polarizing hot-button cultural and social issues. But it appears that Democrats may be on their way to another hard-left McGovern-style blowout. Democrats are now even blaming Mrs. Clinton for being too centrist rather than for running a terrible campaign. The newly elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, is a polarizing far-left figure. The highest-profile Democratic Party supporters are increasingly smug Hollywood actors, rich Wall Street and Silicon Valley elitists, and embittered members of the media, along with careerist identity groups and assorted protest movements — a fossilized 1972 echo chamber. Democrats’ politically correct messaging derides opponents as deplorable racists, sexists, bigots, xenophobes, homophobes, Islamophobes and nativists. That shrill invective only further turns off middle America. Being merely anti-Trump is no more a successful Democratic agenda than being anti-Nixon was in 1972. Of course, anything can happen in politics. Mr. Trump may not seek re-election or could become as unpopular as Lyndon Johnson. War or economic depression could overshadow politics. The Democrats could find a charismatic candidate like Barack Obama who could win on personal popularity. Nonetheless, if in 2020 Democrats go hard left as they did in 1972, then they will likely lose just as big. • Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/democrats-cant-chart-their-way-forward-in-this-wil/
Democrats can’t chart their way forward in this wilderness ANALYSIS/OPINION: In the fog of breathless media coverage of the Trump White House, scant attention has been paid to the civil war breaking out on the other side of the aisle. Like most minority parties that lose the White House, the Democratic Party is without a national leader. Their legislative caucuses in the House and Senate have elected leadership, but the party itself has several elected officials fighting to lead it into the future, all with an eye toward 2020. And the party’s most visible figures aren’t exactly fresh faces. Consider: Hillary Clinton is 69, Sen. Bernard Sanders is 75, former Vice President Joe Biden is 74, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is 77, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the baby of the group, turns 68 in June. Not one of these five Democrats were born in the second half of the 20th century. Does this look like the Party of the Future? AUDIO: Matt Mackowiak with Roger Stone Now couple that aging leadership with fissures within the party that have broken out into the open just in the past two weeks. A “unity tour” featuring new DNC Chairman Tom Perez and Mr. Sanders resulted in: negative headlines, unhappy attendees booing the speakers, Mr. Sanders admitting he still won’t call himself a Democrat, and the bizarre spectacle of Mr. Perez consistently using vulgar language in public. How unifying. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the new DNC vice chair, sharply criticized former President Obama, saying, “Given we lost a lot of statehouse seats, governorships, secretary of states [under Mr. Obama], his true legacy is in danger, and I think he can’t say that he wasn’t part of those losses.” Mr. Sanders campaigned in Omaha for a mayoral candidate who several years ago supported a pro-life bill in the Nebraska legislature, sparking fierce and unrelenting criticism from the party’s pro-choice left wing. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Pelosi argue that not all Democratic candidates must support abortion rights, a position Mr. Perez rejected entirely. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 28 percent of Americans think the Democratic Party is “in touch with the concerns of most people in the U.S.” — 10 percent lower than the comparable finding for President Trump. Back in 2014, the same poll found that 48 percent believed Democrats were “in touch,” a 20-point drop in just three years. Ms. Warren, a liberal icon, stood out among Democrats in openly opposing Mr. Trump’s popular and proportionate response to the chemical attack in Syria, insisting there was “no compelling strategic justification” for the action. The result: In the aftermath of one of the most devastating and shocking national election losses in American history, Democrats remain divided on their future. Opposition to President Trump may unify them, but that is not a policy agenda, and should Democrats gain seats in the midterm elections, it will not offer them a mandate. For now, Democrats appear entirely uninterested in contributing to the public debate, content to offer no new solutions or ideas. Do they have a tax reform plan? No. How would they propose Congress “fix” Obamacare? Crickets. Do they support stronger border security? Of course not. Incredibly, Democrats appear to believe that Hillary Clinton unthinkably lost this election because she was not liberal enough. In fact, Mrs. Clinton lost because she ignored the white working class in the Midwest and ran as a status quo candidate in an election year when voters were craving change. The Clinton campaign arrogantly assumed that opposing Mr. Trump would be enough to win the White House. It was not. Democrats now appear to want to double down on that losing strategy. While Republicans are working to unleash the power of the economy, repeal and replace Obamacare, reform the tax code, rebuild the military and secure the border, Democrats appear unwilling to partner with them on any of these priorities. Not even the Democrats up for reelection in districts and states that Mr. Trump won have moved in the White House’s direction — yet. Elected Democrats are deeply frightened of their own base, fearing primary fights from more liberal challengers next year. The dynamic became evident in the debate over Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, one of the best qualified nominees in recent decades. Democrats chose to pursue the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history, rather than ask tough questions and begrudgingly support Mr. Trump’s qualified choice. Will Democrats offer nothing of any substance for the rest of 2017? Perhaps they are trying to forestall messy policy debates that divide their party. Simple math should tell them to come back to the middle ideologically. But alas, their base demands otherwise. • Matt Mackowiak is the president of Austin-based Potomac Strategy Group, a Republican consultant, a Bush administration and Bush-Cheney re-election campaign veteran, and former press secretary to two U.S. senators.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/hillary-clinton-failure-was-due-to-the-democrats/
The Democratic Party’s ‘Gong Show’ ANALYSIS/OPINION: “[T]he Democratic Party is extremely weak and incapable of organizing people.” — Sen. Bernard Sanders, April 3, 2017. Finally, the Democrats admit it wasn’t the Russians, James B. Comey or sexism that brought Hillary Clinton down. We are now told by journalists, leading Democrats, and even a former Democratic presidential candidate, that it was the inept dysfunction of the party itself, Hillary, and her abused and frightened team that has reduced them all to irrelevant, vapid political busybodies. The poor sops. For such a long time, they told us they were beset by evil Russians, a dastardly FBI director, and that ubiquitously hideous misogyny. Such drama and international intrigue. But we now know the Democratic Party’s woes are not, at all, akin to a James Bond movie. Alas, they’re more like the “Gong Show.” The other week, Hillary Clinton made much of a book she’s working on that, she attested, pins the blame for her failure on the Russians, Mr. Comey and sexism. Sadly, someone beat her to the real story and actually reports the truth of the matter. In “Shattered,” authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes spoke with more than 100 people involved with the campaign, which they describe as “miserable even before it started.” In great detail, they describe a dysfunctional campaign, disconnected candidate, and campaign teams wracked by infighting. In a review of the book, Entertainment Weekly noted, “Although ‘Shattered’ is filled with examples of bad decisions and mishandled crises, it posits the Clinton campaign’s main failure was Hillary’s inability to explain ‘her motivation for seeking the presidency.’ “ Oh, so it was her fault? That’s going to leave a mark. Unless, of course, Mr. Allen and Ms. Parnes are actually Russian agents. Or working for Mr. Comey. Or maybe they, too, are souped-up misogynists being paid by the Koch Brothers. Or something. The blame game, however, is now so dead, even Sen. Bernard Sanders and new leftist leaders of the Democrats are admitting in public that the party is in trouble. On CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Mr. Sanders was blunt: “Well, I think what is clear to anyone who looks at where the Democratic Party today is, that the model of the Democratic Party is failing,” he told host John Dickerson. “Clearly, the Democratic Party has got to change. And, in my view, what it has got to become is a grass-roots party, a party which makes decisions from the bottom on up, a party which is more dependent on small donations than large donations, a party, John, that speaks to the pain of the working class in this country.” Fascinatingly, Mr. Sanders recognizes it’s the party itself that is the problem, but then inexplicably goes on about changing the decision-making process and how they get their money, still refusing to admit that after eight years, we didn’t want any more of what liberals were selling. The Democrats’ problem isn’t cosmetic; rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic wouldn’t have kept her from sinking. Mr. Sanders’ comments offer up a shocking revelation: The Democrats still don’t understand what happened in 2016, and they have no idea how to adapt. The issue isn’t about “bottom up” decision-making, it’s the fact that they can’t even begin to address the economic and national security issues that matter most to Americans. Mr. Sanders pandering about their party needing to “speak to the pain of the working class” of the country is also an insult. It was the Democratic Party and then-President Barack Obama that inflicted that pain on every class of Americans. And yet here is Uncle Bernie trying to pretend the Democrats have been dropped onto Earth from Mars, really, really outraged about whoever it was that set this country on fire. Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made his feelings clear about who’s responsible for the destruction of the party itself. He blames Barack Obama. At a University of Minnesota event he noted, “Barack Obama could have been a better party leader. … Given that we lost a lot of statehouse seats, governorships, secretaries of state, his true legacy is in danger. I think he can’t say that he wasn’t part of those losses. … He’s really good at getting himself elected. … Your legacy is not a building that he’s going to construct in Chicago housing his presidential papers.” Ouch. Finally, someone in the party is admitting the obvious, even if it was cautiously stated: Mr. Obama destroyed the party while creating his own cult of personality. This is so obvious, Josh Earnest, Mr. Obama’s former press secretary and now a contributor at MSNBC, said this: “What Deputy Chairman Ellison just said is true. Barack Obama didn’t run to be a party leader, he ran to be president of the United States.” But then Mr. Earnest admitted this disaster was on Mr. Obama’s mind because, “There are consequences for this deterioration of Democratic strength all across the country for the president’s legacy.” This was a perfect summation of the inept malevolence of Mr. Obama, the man. His enablers and sycophants admit that only Mr. Obama matters, and in their scramble to “fundamentally transform America,” he may have damaged the United States, but in true malignant, narcissistic fashion, his lasting legacy is the destruction of the Democratic Party.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/congress-has-been-stalling-border-wall-funding/
Congress has been stalling border wall funding ANALYSIS/OPINION: A full decade after voting to construct a secure barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico, Congress continues to refuse to lay out the money required to build the damned wall. This, even after the stunning upset in last year’s elections by the juggernaut presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, who won the presidency on a clarion vow to voters that he would once and for all build a wall along the border. Mr. Trump’s historic upset came after years and years of both Democrat and Republican politicians talking tough about illegal immigration and promising to crack down on the porous border, yet refusing to actually fix the problem. Because they are politicians. If you fix the problem, then you can no longer campaign on the problem. This wall, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign, would finally halt not only illegal immigration, but also the highly destructive drugs, gangs and slavery pouring over the southern border. Despite the clear message from voters last year, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismisses the wall as “immoral, expensive and unwise.” Her comment made history as the moment Nancy Pelosi finally discovered morality. Also noteworthy is that it was the first time Nancy Pelosi has every found anything to be too “expensive” to stick to the poor, innocent American taxpayer. As for her mention of wisdom? Well, clearly, that was some kind of typo or another one of her random brain sizzles. It wasn’t so long ago that Ms. Pelosi’s fellow Democrats were all for the immoral and expensive. Her party’s last two standard-bearers — former President Barack Obama and twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — both voted in favor of the so-called “Secure Fence Act of 2006.” After passing the construction of that barrier into law, Congress balked at actually paying for it and ultimately scrapped much of it in favor of — well, whatever the White House felt like doing. Under former President Bush and then President Obama, that wasn’t much. Since then, problems at the border have only grown worse. Today, there are untold millions of illegal aliens in the United States, including many who are criminals. “Bad hombres,” Mr. Trump calls them. Increasingly, we hear reports of staggering violence committed by the international gang MS-13, made up primarily of illegal aliens from Central America. These vicious thugs peddle the drugs across the border and import slavery in the form of human trafficking. The violence they are capable of is beyond the imagination of civilized people. To be sure, these gangs got much stronger under Mr. Obama. Throughout his entire presidency, the U.S. border had a giant blinking neon “WELCOME” sign, encouraging men, women, children and criminals to storm across the border. This beefed up the ranks of MS-13 and led to who knows how many crimes against Americans. Everyone remembers Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old killed two years ago while walking along a pier with her family in San Francisco. Charged with her murder was an illegal from Mexico who had been deported five times. It is a fair question: How many Kate Steinles are there? The answer is maddening: We have no idea. That is because the federal government, which keeps records of how many toilets every citizen has in their homes, does not keep track of how many Americans are killed by illegal aliens who are supposed to be kept out of the country by said federal government. Such information is scattered, and federal bureaucrats are shockingly incurious about compiling that information. Any information they do have is not shared with the public. “During the Obama administration, it seemed to be very intentional. The numbers were hidden,” explained Timothy Lyng, president of The Remembrance Project, a group dedicated to giving voice to the victims killed by illegals. But there is hope. President Trump says he remains committed to building the wall. Already, he has done more than the last five presidents and 40 years of Congresses to fix the problem. Just since taking office, border crossings have plummeted by an unthinkable 70 percent or more. Mr. Trump has earned the credibility to get the money he wants for the wall from a Congress that has proved itself utterly incompetent when it comes to fixing the border. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

Why Boeing and Airbus deals with Iran shouldn’t fly ANALYSIS/OPINION: Sometimes international law is ambiguous. Sometimes not. When it comes to murdering civilians and using chemical weapons to get the job done, there are no gray areas, no fuzzy lines, no mitigating circumstances. Such practices are clearly and specifically prohibited under what’s called “the law of war.” That makes Bashar Assad, Syria’s dynastic dictator, a war criminal. And it makes Iran his chief accomplice. As far back as 2005, Jane’s Defense Weekly reported that Iran’s rulers were actively helping Mr. Assad launch an “innovative chemical warfare program” — providing technology to build equipment that would produce “hundreds of tons of precursors for VX, sarin nerve agents and mustard blister agent.” When it comes to the Islamic republic, President Trump and his advisers are under no illusions. “Everywhere you look, if there’s trouble in the region, you find Iran,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis said last Wednesday during a visit to Saudi Arabia. “Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed the same day. The clerical regime, he added, “is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon and continuing to support attacks against Israel. An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.” So what’s the Trump administration’s strategy for checking Iran? That’s still a work in progress. But some measures can and should be taken immediately. In particular, unlike his predecessor, Mr. Trump should refrain from facilitating Iran’s support for terrorism and war crimes. For example: During the final months of the Obama administration, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a license for Boeing to sell 100 new planes to Iran Air, “the airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Treasury also issued licenses to Airbus for a similarly sized deal. Iranian officials claim these aircraft will be used for civilian purposes only. The evidence suggests they’re lying. Emanuele Ottolenghi, my colleague at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, has been painstakingly tracking Iran Air flights between Tehran and Damascus. There have been 768 since Jan. 16, 2016, the day that President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was implemented. Of those 129 were on Iran Air. Mr. Ottolenghi believes few, if any, are ferrying tourists keen on sightseeing, shopping and fine dining. He believes they are supplying military equipment and fighters in support of Mr. Assad’s forces and those of Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanon-based proxy militia, which has been deployed to help defend Mr. Assad’s regime. It’s worth recalling that, in 2011, Treasury “designated” Iran Air for providing material support and services to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, which had itself been designated for proliferating weapons of mass destruction. Treasury particularly noted that Iran Air had been transporting “missile or rocket components to Syria.” Then, suddenly, just over a year ago, Iran Air’s designation was removed. Administration spokesmen declined to explain why except to say they were acting “pursuant” to the JCPOA. An educated guess: President Obama had added a sweetener — one of many — to a deal he saw as essential to his legacy. Decades of sanctions against Iran’s civil aviation sector were lifted as well. In congressional testimony earlier this month, Mr. Ottolenghi said that from Iran’s perspective, the timing could not have been better: This was the point at which the aviation sector “became vital to Tehran’s war efforts in the Syrian theater.” Mr. Ottolenghi is recommending that the Trump administration, at the least, now “suspend licensing for aircraft deals while it conducts a thorough review of their role in the airlifts to Syria.” The U.S. intelligence community has the means to determine what’s moving between Iran and Syria. If these flights are, in fact, military rather than commercial and civilian, Mr. Ottolenghi would urge the administration to sanction — or rather resanction — Iran’s entire aviation sector. Because these would be non-nuclear sanctions, doing so would not violate the JCPOA. Airbus’ license can and should be suspended as well because its planes contain key parts made in the USA. The same week Mr. Assad used chemical weapons to slaughter more than 70 people in northwestern Syria, yet another Iranian airline, Aseman, signed yet another deal to purchase Boeing planes. Aseman’s CEO, Hossein Alaei, spent most of his career in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Ministry of Defense, a branch of Iran’s government also designated for proliferating weapons of mass destruction and their delivery system. Mr. Trump should instruct Treasury not to grant a license to Aseman, either. Executives, stockholders and lobbyists for Boeing and Airbus will not be pleased by what I’ve written above. But they should ask themselves: Do they really want history to record that they helped Iran Air enable Mr. Assad’s mass murder of innocent men, women and children? Under the JCPOA, Iran’s rulers agreed to delay — not end — a nuclear weapons program whose existence they do not acknowledge. In exchange, they’ve received billions of dollars as well as permission to join the nuclear weapons club a few years down the road. What if, at that point, they’re still the world’s leading sponsors of terrorism, vowing genocide against Israel and “Death to America!”? Under the deal Mr. Obama concluded, that won’t matter. When it comes to the threats Mr. Obama left for his successor, none is more daunting than that posed by Tehran. In principle, Mr. Trump should be encouraging Boeing and other American companies to make a buck abroad. But as a matter of principle, Mr. Trump should not allow Boeing nor any other American companies to be in the business of aiding and abetting terrorists and war criminals. • Clifford D.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/hillary-clinton-loss-detailed-in-book-shattered/
Hillary as seen by official Washington ANALYSIS/OPINION: We call it Kultursmog, it being that collection of attitudes, ideas, tastes and personages that are polluted by the politics of the left and that predominate on both coasts. And who are we? We are the freethinkers who are immune to the Kultursmog by virtue of our natural skepticism and reliance on empiricism, which is to say, reliance on evidence. Thus, we understand and generally accept that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. We also accept that Hillary Clinton, assisted by her hubby and their consultants, lost the election. In fact, she lost the election after outspending Donald two to one and turning many of her consultants into millionaires. Now the question being asked by political wizards is why Hillary lost despite being the smartest candidate, the most virtuous candidate, and, oh yes, the candidate with the best sense of humor since W.C. Fields, though she is a lot prettier. And the question being asked by us — that is to say, us skeptics — is: Has the Kultursmog learned anything since Hillary’s defeat, by which we mean her latest defeat? You will recall that in her 2016 race she was dubbed the “inevitable” one, at least until the clock struck 8 p.m. on Nov. 8, much as she was dubbed the “inevitable” one through the election cycle of 2008 until there emerged a little-known community organizer. Incidentally, does anyone wonder how Candidate Trump would deal with Candidate Obama? That would be a campaign for the ages. Now there has appeared from the hazy vapors of the smog a book attempting to explain the election, and all the smog’s outlets are reviewing it. The book is titled “Shattered: Inside Hillary’s Clinton’s Doomed Campaign.” The best thing about it is the title, “Shattered.” After that it is pretty uneven. There are a few glints of understanding, but from what I can tell from reading “Shattered” and its reviews, the Kultursmog remains securely in the dark. According to it, Hillary was the victim of plots by FBI Director James B. Comey, Russian hackers, errors made by her staff, the sinister doings of “the deplorables,” and misogyny. Six decades after the dawn of feminism, with the feminists’ fingerprints all over the republic, Hillary still cannot get a break. Though I am told by reliable sources that up there in the Kultursmog she is contemplating another suicidal run in 2020. She does not take no for an answer. As I say, there are glints in “Shattered” that suggest the authors have learned a thing or two about the new political scene that we were being presented with in 2016, though there are few references to Donald Trump and the unique campaign he waged. He proved to be the finest campaigner in my adult life going all the way back to Bob Kennedy in 1968. And Hillary, after all the absurd laudations that the Kultursmog has basted her in, is about the worst. As the authors say, “The campaign was an unholy mess, fraught with tangled lines of authority, petty jealousies, distorted priorities, and no sense of purpose.” Hillary never could explain why she was running for president. The only other candidate who had trouble answering that question was, as I recall, Teddy Kennedy as he sat frozen before CBS’ Roger Mudd in 1980. So “Shattered” does provide some answers as to why Hillary lost and what the Kultursmog has learned, which is very little. One learns this by noting what the smog neglects to mention. For instance, there is only a brief mention of why she nearly collapsed on a New York street and nothing about the dark glasses she wore, provoking her critics to question her health. Others get angry in this book and even use coarse language but not Hillary, despite years of witnesses quoting her foul mouth. There is no mention of her election night tantrum fueled by alcohol. Why not at least mention that her critics were leveling such charges that night? Finally, there are people who ought to be mentioned, but are not. Why no David Brock, her controversial ally, or Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime adviser? The best chapter in this book is the chapter on Hillary’s server and her failure to deal with it honestly and expeditiously. But by not mentioning Mr. Blumenthal and the 23 classified memos that the Daily Caller reported from his correspondence with her (they were classified as “Confidential” and “Secret”), knowledgeable readers will suspect a cover-up. This is why when we skeptics come across some artifact fashioned by the Kultursmog, we sense that it will be in some way untrustworthy. We are rarely wrong. Just over the weekend, The Washington Post reported polls that suggest Donald Trump’s days are numbered. It is not until readers get to the very end of the report that they discover Donald Trump still beats Hillary 43 percent to 40 percent — an even wider margin than on election night. • R.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/net-neutrality-must-be-fixed-by-congress/
Controlling the nation’s internet ANALYSIS/OPINION: Do you remember the last time you had an issue with your internet connection and the federal government cheerfully helped you resolve it? Me neither. Yet the same federal government who spent $2 billion on a website that was more likely to dish out electric shocks than work properly is now literally in control of our nation’s internet, under the false rubric of promoting “net neutrality.” Since 1996, the internet had been designated as “information services” and left unregulated. But under the Obama administration’s 2015 FCC order, the internet was redefined as a “common carrier,” putting it under the thumb of Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, the Depression-era law that kept our nation’s telegraphs and rotary phones humming. The core concepts of true net neutrality are simple. They include no blocking of information or resources, no intentional slowing or reduction in available bandwidth, no “pay to play” allocation of higher speeds, and protection of consumers’ online privacy. There’s broad agreement on these principles, the crucial difference is how we enforce them. The open, fair, and innovative internet we’ve all come to rely on got where it is today through market forces, not government oversight and regulation. It was consumers who sorted out the winners (Facebook, Mozilla, Google) from the losers (MySpace, Netscape, Pets.com) and that’s exactly as it should be. The internet has worked because it remained largely a democratic free-market, unsullied by an overarching government scheme. The internet now will be dripping with government scheme, as Title II regulates internet providers as it would a monopolistic utility from 80 years ago. Government’s heavy hand is already wreaking damage by throttling the investments which help fuel the engine of innovation. Since the Title II order went into effect, investment in broadband has gone down each quarter — a first. This has led to providers having to slow expansion, upgrades, and new services for their customers, reversing the trend of the internet giving us more content, better service, faster speeds, at less cost. Consumers lose with government regulating the internet like a utility, but big content providers like Google, Facebook and Netflix love it because they win no matter what rules the government imposes on our modems or local internet providers. Title II limits its regulations to service, not content, seemingly oblivious to the reality that content relies entirely on broadband infrastructure and service technology. Before the FCC chose to butt-in, the FTC capably protected consumers from unfair competition and deceptive practices. They successfully took multiple companies, including Google, to court for various transgressions. There is no reason why this enforcement mechanism cannot continue to serve consumer interests. With new technologies on the horizon that will provide unprecedented speeds, processing power, and opportunities for innovation, it is critical that we return to a free-market framework of limited regulation which allowed the internet to become the powerful tool of innovation and economic transformation it is today. Repealing the current stifling rules will unleash a flood of online investment, experimentation, and innovation. Grave concern over the government regulating the internet is even shared by the very person who coined the term “net neutrality,” law professor Tim Wu, who worries that the FCC’s present rules gives government the power to shape “media policy, social policy, oversight of the political process, [and] issues free speech.” That is a frightening amount of power for the government to have, especially given their recent record of wholesale privacy violations. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it a priority to establish a policy framework that protects both consumers and the future of the internet. The key rests with Congress, who ought to work with Chairman Pai to see this vision become reality and endure as administrations come and go. Over time, the concerns about net neutrality, security, privacy, and free and fair competition will only grow more urgent. Now is the time to put workable rules in place that will definitively protect the interests of consumers and make sure the internet remains open to everyone. • Gerard Scimeca, a lawyer, is vice president of CASE, Consumer Action for a Strong Economy, based in Arlington, Virginia.

Jake Tapper, CNN anchor, sells $1.4-million Northwest D.C. home: Report CNN anchor Jake Tapper has sold the Northwest Washington, D.C., home he and his wife have owned for almost a decade, Variety reported Thursday. The property went for $1.4 million. The magazine describes the residence as a nearly 3,000-square-foot, 5-bedroom home in the capital’s Forest Hills neighborhood, just “about five miles due north of the White House.” Mr. Tapper and wife Jennifer purchased the home in June 2007 for $1.25 million and it was hailed as a “stylish Washington retreat” in a March/April 2008 profile for Home & Design magazine. “I had a deep emotional connection to it on one level because it reminds me a lot of my grandparents’ house,” Mr. Tapper said at the time.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/24/trump-warned-on-supreme-court-picks-by-pro-life-re/
Conservative groups trying to derail two potential Supreme Court picks As President Trump nears a decision this week on his Supreme Court nominee, conservative groups are actively trying to derail at least two of the judges reported to be at the top of his list, saying they can’t be relied on to pursue conservative goals from the federal bench. One group is running ads accusing 11th U.S. Circuit Court Judge William Pryor of showing hostility toward religious liberty in a 2011 case, and another is warning Mr. Trump not to pick 10th U.S. Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, saying he has not shown enough devotion to pro-life causes. Mr. Trump met with top senators Tuesday to begin the consultation process. He said he wants to make his decision this week and announce the nominee next week. SEE ALSO: Donald Trump to name Supreme Court pick next Thursday The next justice will tip the ideological balance on the now-deadlocked Supreme Court and replace Antonin Scalia, a conservative stalwart whose seat has been empty since his death nearly a year ago. Public Advocate, run by conservative activist Eugene Delgaudio, has launched online ads in the Washington area trying to raise opposition to Judge Pryor, a former Alabama attorney general, saying he didn’t do enough to protect Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in a 2003 legal battle over posting the Ten Commandments at his courthouse. “Public Advocate has budgeted a lot of money refuting some of the legal issues [Judge] Pryor takes so lightly, and as I point out frequently: No other judge has removed an elected official, like Roy Moore, for believing in God and the Ten Commandments in the history of our country,” Mr. Delgaudio said. SEE ALSO: Tom Perez: Democrats should filibuster ‘hard right’ Supreme Court nominee His ads also highlight a case in which Judge Pryor was involved in which the appeals court ruled that a college did not discriminate against a student who was expelled for refusing to attend a gay pride parade. Going to the parade was part of “remediation” measures for the Christian student, who was studying counseling. Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious liberties law firm, represented the Christian student but declined to comment to The Washington Times about Judge Pryor’s possible selection. The Judicial Action Group said Judge Pryor’s judicial record demonstrates that he “failed to interpret the Constitution as the framers intended.” Some pro-life activists, meanwhile, say Judge Gorsuch would not meet Mr. Trump’s pledge to put pro-life judges on the federal bench. Andrew Schlafly, a lawyer at the Legal Center for Defense of Life and son of the late conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, said Judge Gorsuch uses pro-choice terminology in his writings and may not be willing to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national constitutional right to abortion. “Gorsuch is not pro-life,” Mr. Schlafly said. “That would break Trump’s pro-life pledge to pick Gorsuch.” Defending the choices Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said the attacks on both judges were misplaced. “Pryor does have a very, very solid record on having a principled approach to the Constitution,” Ms. Severino said. “He’s a stellar lawyer, so I think he would be an excellent choice.” As for Judge Gorsuch, she said, those attacking his record are looking for the wrong characteristics in a justice. “It’s important for the serious pro-life groups to make clear that they’re not looking at people who are supposed to be basically activists, bypassing the law on any issue,” she said. Judge Gorsuch, through the clerk of court for the 10th Circuit, declined to comment. Judge Pryor did not respond to a request for comment. American Family Association public policy analyst Abraham Hamilton III said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans dare not “err in filling this vacancy,” saying the pick must live up to the legacy of Justice Scalia, one of the most forceful conservative voices on the court for decades. He said Judge Pryor had a distinguished record but was not sure he lives up to Justice Scalia’s vision “as an originalist constructionist” in some areas of constitutional law, including religious liberty. “The country would be served best by filling Justice Scalia’s vacant seat with a Scalia-like nominee,” Mr. Hamilton said. Mr. Schlafly said he was worried about who had Mr. Trump’s ear in the selection process. He pointed in particular to the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian law professors, students and scholars. “The problem is really Trump’s advisers, to be honest with you,” Mr. Schlafly said. Mr. Trump said the Federalist Society, The Heritage Foundation and other conservative activists helped him shape his initial list of potential nominees, which he released in an unconventional move in the middle of the presidential campaign. The list won widespread praise from conservatives and helped him consolidate support among the Republican base after a contentious primary. Democrats have signaled that they will fight whomever Mr. Trump picks if they deem the nominee out of the mainstream. Many Democrats remain angry that the Republican Senate majority blocked any vote before the election on President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the Scalia seat. “Clearly, what they did with Garland was wrong, but we’re not playing tit-for-tat here. We want a mainstream nominee because we want what’s right for America,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer countered in his Tuesday briefing, “I think it’s pretty mainstream to support the Constitution, pretty mainstream to respect, to follow the law and not to create laws from the bench.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, rejected Democratic complaints about how the Garland nomination was handled. He said there was a difference between stopping a nominee from a lame-duck president in the months ahead of a presidential election and stopping a pick at the start of a president’s tenure. He also said that when Republicans were in the minority in the Senate, they didn’t mount filibusters to block nominees in the first years of either President Clinton or Mr. Obama’s administrations. “What we hope would be that our Democratic friends would treat President Trump’s nominees in the same way we treated Clinton and Obama,” Mr. McConnell said. • Dave Boyer and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/7/nationals-park-led-billboards-concern-southwest-wa/
Nationals Park LED billboards concern Southwest waterfront residents Some residents of the Southwest waterfront fear the neighborhood could be pestered by flashing billboards after the D.C. Council on Tuesday passed a measure that allows the Washington Nationals to install massive LED ads on the baseball stadium’s exterior walls. Questions remain about how the signs will affect the waterfront district, even though the legislation underwent several revisions to restrict the number, size and location of the billboards. “It’s still a bad bill because it permits five gigantic, electronic, light-polluting, ad-spewing machines on the side of the Nats stadium,” said Meg Maguire, a member of The Committee of 100 on the Federal City — a nonprofit organization founded nearly a century ago to monitor development in the District. “The restrictions don’t take away the problem.” The Committee of 100 on the Federal City is joined by Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Andy Litsky in opposing the lighted signs — opposition that goes beyond where and how the signs will be placed, Ms. Maguire said in an interview. “This comes at a time when we know that light pollution has an effect on human health,” she said. “We know that LED bulbs can be injurious to sleep, and now we’re putting up these massive machines. They’re going to pollute our beautiful, emerging, mixed-use communities.” The measure allows the Nationals to erect five LED screens no larger than 38 feet by 25 feet outside the 8-year-old stadium. The team says billboards will generate up to $5 million a year in ad revenue — a tidy sum for a young club looking to make another playoff run and possibly pick up more talent along the way. The team hopes to have the billboards in place for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game, which the Nationals are scheduled to host. Council member Charles Allen, who represents the Ward 6 neighborhood where Nationals Park is located, said lawmakers made some concessions in revising the legislation to address criticism about the lighted signs since the first public hearing on the measure in November. Originally, the bill called for 10 signs and had few restrictions on their placement. The revised bill, which the council passed 12-1 Tuesday, cuts the number of billboards in half and prohibits them from directly facing South Capitol Street or residential buildings. Mr. Allen acknowledged that the legislation wouldn’t make everyone happy, but said there are enough provisions to quell any fears that the signs will start popping up all over the city. He said those kinds of sings aren’t appropriate everywhere, but LED billboards make sense in a lively entertainment district with a baseball stadium. But that wasn’t enough to persuade council member Elissa Silverman, the lone dissenting vote on the council. “This thing was fast-tracked in a month,” the at-large independent told The Washington Times on Wednesday. “Perhaps there’s a time and place for them, but what’s the rush to judgment here?” Ms. Silverman said she wants to know more about the signs’ impact on property values, how they could affect drivers and how they could change the character of the neighborhood. Ms. Maguire pointed to Chinatown as an example of LED billboards degrading residents’ quality of life. The Verizon Center in 2012 was approved for an exemption of the city’s 1931 moratorium on issuing permits for large signs. “Do you want that in your face night and day?” she said. “The excuse is that it will somehow enliven the public space, but that’s a problem best solved by urban designers, people who operate at a human scale. You don’t just call up a billboard company.” And Ms. Silverman is still concerned about giant signs popping up across the District, despite provisions in the bill excepting the stadium from the mostly citywide ban on lighted billboards. “There’s a legitimate fear that if you create a carve out for the Nats, it’s a Pandora’s box,” she said. “It’s not like that’s unfounded.” Ms. Silverman said property owners near the stadium already have started lobbying for their own digital billboards. With the bill likely to get final approval later this month, Ms. Maguire said she’s more focused on trying to fix what’s wrong with it. She held fast that The Committee of 100 would work in coming weeks to revise the bill before its second vote on Dec. 20. “We understand that at this point, the votes to overturn aren’t there. We don’t like that, but there are other bad things in the bill that need to be corrected. We’re going to continue to tell people what this bill does,” she said. “We want this bad bill to be as good as it can when it comes out.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Corey Lewandowski: Loretta Lynch should ‘absolutely’ recuse herself in Clinton email case Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, said on Friday that Attorney General Loretta Lynch should “absolutely” recuse herself from overseeing the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “What I suggest is she should absolutely recuse herself,” Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN’s “New Day.” Republicans have stepped up their calls for Ms. Lynch to recuse herself in light of a private meeting the attorney general held earlier in the week with former President Clinton at an airport in Arizona. Ms. Lynch said the meeting touched mainly on personal matters and that the investigation did not come up. But The New York Times, citing a Justice Department official, reported Friday that Ms. Lynch plans to announce that she will accept whatever recommendation career prosecutors and the FBI make about whether to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. “The optics are terrible. It should have never been done. She should have never been on that airplane,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “This is a disaster, and this is the problem with Washington, D.C.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Obama lifts ban on selling U.S. arms to Hanoi in a bitter irony for Vietnam veterans U.S. President Obama on this week lifted a half-century ban on selling arms to Vietnam, a move that is raising concerns among some Vietnam War veterans. “At this stage, both sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect,” said Mr. Obama in Hanoi during his first visit to the country. “This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.” He said every U.S. arms sale would be reviewed case by case to take into account Vietnam’s human-rights record. At a joint press conference with Mr. Obama, Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang said the two countries are “former enemies turned friends.” “And now we are comprehensive partners,” he said. More than 58,200 U.S. soldiers were killed in Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in 1975. But the administration saw advantages in easing the embargo, both as a warning to expansionist China and as leverage to compel the communist regime in Hanoi to improve its record on human rights. “We are thinking through how our evolving security cooperation [is] going to look moving forward,” said White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes prior to the visit. “They regularly raise this issue with us. We are looking at, of course, how our broader relationship is evolving, including our continued commitment to support human rights in Vietnam.” The notion of selling more lethal weaponry to Vietnam is a bitter irony to some veterans of the war and to some Vietnamese-Americans who fled the communists. “They are still a communist country,” said retired Army Maj. Wulf Linden, a Georgia resident who served two tours in Vietnam. “If it’s the cream of our crop [of weapons systems], obviously that would be a bad mistake. It would be nice if we’re not selling to a regime that’s a documented communist regime. That’s my concern.” Army veteran Ralph Riccio, a Pennsylvania resident who served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969, said he has mixed feelings about the potential arms sales. “As somebody who got shot at in Vietnam, I find it a little bit ironic that we’re selling them weapons now,” Mr. Riccio said. “I find it a little bit uncomfortable to come to grips with.” But he noted other examples of the U.S. embracing former wartime adversaries, such as Germany and Japan after World War II. “I understand that one day somebody’s an enemy and the next day they’re not that much of an enemy,” he said. Joe Frank, a former national commander of the American Legion and an Army veteran who lost the use of his legs to a land mine in Vietnam, said he never dreamed in the late 1960s that the U.S. would one day seek a closer alliance with Hanoi. But he said he accepts the politics of the move. “I lost a lot of friends in Vietnam. They’re on that black granite wall [the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington],” Mr. Frank said. “A soldier like me, just like the Vietnamese, we were just taking our orders from those up above. This [arms sales] is politics. It doesn’t bother me as long as long as this is well-researched.” Beefing up Vietnam’s defenses is a crucial step for the Obama administration in standing up to China’s military influence, said James Zumwalt, a retired Marine infantry officer who served in Vietnam and has written extensively about Southeast Asia. “I am not an Obama fan,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “But this is one of the few things they’ve done in the foreign policy area that I totally agree with.” He said the administration must do more to confront China over its territorial claims in the South China Sea, a region of major shipping lanes and energy deposits where Beijing has been building artificial islands. “China will try to do anything and everything they can in the remaining 200-some days that Obama’s in office to establish themselves in the South China Sea,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “That’s why I think it is absolutely imperative that Obama show some backbone and take this step and do it in a way that leaves no doubt in the minds of the Chinese that we’re upset with what they’ve done. We’ve let China get away with so much, this is kind of an inexpensive way of conveying a message to China.” Mr. Obama said his decision to lift the ban on arms sales “was not based on China,” although he added that he wants to help Vietnam “improve their maritime security posture.” “My decision to lift the ban really was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship,” the president said Monday. “Given all the work we do together across the spectrum of economic, trade, security and humanitarian efforts, that it was appropriate for us not to have a blanket across-the-board ban.” Vietnam has purchased much of its military equipment, including submarines, from Russia and is seeking costly high-tech weaponry from the U.S. The U.S., however, wouldn’t feel the effects of an arms sales agreement overnight, said Richard Fontaine, a defense analyst at the Center for New American Security who served as an adviser to Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican. Mr. Fontaine said the anti-Vietnam sentiment in Congress has faded. “It’s no longer the political obstacle that it was even 10 or 15 years ago,” he said. “The general sentiment on Capitol Hill has been, as long as Vietnam is moving in the right direction — even rather gradually toward opening up the political space and the religious freedom space and the rule of law — then we want to have an increasingly close relationship. At the same time, [on] the defense side of things, I don’t think that you will see and you shouldn’t see the United States sell truncheons and tear gas and the kinds of things that could be used for domestic repression.” Many Vietnamese-Americans say the repressive communist government doesn’t deserve the benefits of closer military and economic ties with the U.S. Bao Nguyen, the mayor of Garden Grove, California, has written a letter to Mr. Obama and to Secretary of State John F. Kerry about Vietnam’s “atrocious” human rights record, including its imprisonment of dissidents in solitary confinement without charges. “While we have an arms surplus to deal with, I don’t think dumping those arms on developing nations is the most effective way to counter China,” Mr. Nguyen said. “That’s because there’s no way to know that the government won’t use those weapons against its own people. Especially a government as corrupt and autocratic as Vietnam.” Mr. Zumwalt said the U.S. sometimes needs to work with unsavory partners, as it did with autocratic Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos during the Vietnam War. “Would I like to see a democratic government in Vietnam? I sure would,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “But I see Vietnam as being the lesser of two evils. We’ve got to show some backbone. We’ve got to show it with the Vietnamese, and we’ve got to convey the point to China that enough’s enough.” Mr. Obama’s 47th foreign trip will include three days in Vietnam and a Group of Seven summit in Japan, where he will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima. He will promote the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which includes the U.S., Vietnam and Japan. The deal is stalled in Congress and faces strong opposition from the leading presidential candidates and most Democrats, who say it doesn’t protect U.S. workers from unfair trade practices. On the issue of human rights in Vietnam, five Republican senators sent a letter Friday to Mr. Obama calling Hanoi “one of the most repressive regimes in the world” and urging Mr. Obama to press Vietnamese leaders to do more to improve religious freedom and other human rights. The letter was authored by Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, John Boozman of Arkansas, John Cornyn of Texas, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Human rights groups are urging Mr. Obama to call on Vietnamese leaders, who held a rubber-stamp election of their one-party rule last weekend, to release political prisoners and other activists. “Obama should stand next to Vietnam’s leaders in public and call on them to respect the right to freely choose government representatives, stand for office and peacefully advocate for democracy,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “If this trip is partially about legacy-building, as some suggest, there can be no more meaningful legacy than helping the people of Vietnam achieve fundamental reforms.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Nugent: Obama’s fault no guns allowed at Trump NRA speech LOUISVILLE | Rock legend Ted Nugent on Sunday said a failed criminal justice system under the leadership of President Obama is why NRA conventiongoers weren’t allowed to bring their guns with them into a Friday forum featuring likely GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mr. Nugent opened up the floor for questions during his Sunday event, and a man asked him about the Secret Service’s preventing people from bringing their guns into the Trump speech — a speech in which Mr. Trump pledged to get rid of gun-free zones. “It’s a dichotomy if ever there was one,” Mr. Nugent said. He recalled his own run-in with the Secret Service and described it as a positive experience. That was an apparent reference to a meeting prompted by comments he made at an NRA event in April 2012 that if Mr. Obama was re-elected, Mr. Nugent would either be dead or in jail by the same time the following year. “In fact, I admired and saluted ‘em face to face when they came to investigate me,” he said. “They are our friends,” he said. “The majority of law enforcement, including the feds, the majority are on our side. “The reason that policy has to exist is because of our failed court system,” he said. “Rapists, murderers, child molesters, ‘knockout’ game monsters walk the streets with us,” he said. “But instead of just keeping devils in cages, our failed anti-justice system has freed them into our communities, and now [with] Barack Obama, now there’s tens of thousands of more. “And so that’s why law enforcement has to err on the side of caution, knowing that our judges and our prosecutors and our states’ attorneys and mostly the U.S. attorneys — they have freed monsters among us,” he said. “That’s who the Secret Service is protecting Donald Trump and the other candidates from,” he said. “They’re not protecting ‘em from NRA members. “If we would keep rapists and murderers and ‘knockout’ gamers and carjackers in cages forever, no one would have to protect anybody from anybody,” he said to cheers and applause. “Everybody knows — everybody knows — that sex crimes, [molesting] is a 100 percent recidivistic crime. Everybody knows that, and our system lets them out,” he said. “Shoot them and kill them. Since they won’t control them, we shall. “’Nugent was recommending vigilanteism,’” he then said mockingly. “Whatever.” A woman also asked Mr. Nugent if he would make some phone calls because she has tickets to his July 1 show in Arizona and was afraid they wouldn’t allow guns there. “You got to me kidding me,” he replied. “We usually frisk people. If they’re unarmed, we loan ‘em one. “I will make those calls. I can’t promise anything. I’m not going to not perform, because I’ll have my gun,” he said. “That is upsetting,” he said. “So there’s going to be moments in life that don’t make any sense, and I can’t just move into Arizona and move into every state” and decree a new law, he said. “I got a lot of power, but I ain’t got that much,” he said. “So I will work on that and I will talk to the authorities.” “And I would have no problem,” he said. “In fact, I happen to know that most of you are armed right here, and I’ve never felt safer in my life.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

King says he hasn’t seen evidence of Burr ‘slow walking’ Russia investigation Sen. Angus King of Maine said Tuesday he hasn’t seen any “evidence” of the Senate’s investigation on Russia stalled by Republicans in charge. “I understand the frustration, I feel it myself,” Mr. King said on CNN, in regards to the committee’s the slow progress, but he added that he doesn’t believe it’s because of the leadership. “I haven’t seen evidence of Chairman Burr slow walking this. If I do I’ll poke him,” Mr. King said. SEE ALSO: Trump’s lawyer launches legal action against BuzzFeed for publishing ‘completely fabricated’ dossier The Maine independent was responding to reports that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr was slow to sign off on collecting evidence in the committee’s investigation on Russia. But Mr. King explained the investigation is “complex” and involves several government agencies, a foreign government and thousands of pages of documents to read through, which can be a slow process. “I think Richard Burr understands, as I told him the other day, history has its eyes on us,” Mr. King said.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/25/donald-trump-name-scotus-pick-thursday/
Donald Trump to name Supreme Court pick next Thursday President Trump will announce on Thursday of next week who he wants to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, which has remained vacant for nearly a year. There are three judges reportedly in the running as Mr. Trump’s top picks for the high court. Those include: 11th U.S. Circuit Court Judge William Pryor, Judge Neil Gorsuch of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman. “I will be making my Supreme Court pick on Thursday of next week. Thank you!” Mr. Trumptweeted early Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump consulted with senators on Tuesday about his pick for the federal bench. The court has remained deadlocked since Scalia passed away last February. Republicans hope Mr. Trump will fill the seat with a staunch conservative who will defend the Constitution and follow the founders’ constitutional intent. “With Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing, Republicans cannot err in filling this vacancy,” American Family Association public policy analyst Abraham Hamilton III told The Washington Times. “In many respects, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick(s) will define his presidential legacy, especially considering that his SCOTUS appointees’ tenure will far exceed his own.” Democrats have suggested they will protest Mr. Trump’s pick if they deem that person to be unfit. “We want a mainstream nominee because we want what’s right for America,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, stated. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Tom Perez: Democrats should filibuster ‘hard right’ Supreme Court nominee Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Wednesday that Democrats should filibuster President Trump’s next U.S. Supreme Court nominee if the candidate supports the “hard right.” “If they support the hard right, absolutely,” Mr. Perez said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “If they’re going to continue to go to the hard right, I think you have to do that.” Mr. Trump indicated Wednesday he’d be making his decision on his choice to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia next Thursday. Mr. Perez, the labor secretary under former President Barack Obama, is also running to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He said he’s a fan of data analytics, but that they’re no substitute for “good, old-fashioned organizing.” “I think Howard Dean was right: We need a 50-state strategy, along with the territories, and when you do that, when you work with states to make sure we’re fielding candidates from school board to the Senate, that’s how you rebuild the Democratic party,” he said.

Winter storm hampers NCAA travel, hits cherry blossoms That’s Stella, as in Stella the double-fisted winter storm that’s threatening to punch her way from the Plains eastward before moving into Maine. It seems the last laugh isn’t on those of you who took the word of prognosticator Shipoke Sheena over trusty-dusty Punxsutawney Phil. After all, Sheena is merely a dog in groundhog’s clothing while Phil is the real deal. Phil saw his shadow on Feb. 2 (remember?), predicting six more weeks of winterlike weather. Now along comes Stella — or, more acutely, STELLA!!! (The storm that’s forecast to deliver a blow the mid-Atlantic and move straight on to New England is worthy of my best Marlon Brando impression.) As with any winter storm, Stella’s whipping skirt tails are expected to disrupt our daily routines, including happy hour. However, she’s also going to disrupt our planned activities — and why not. As the humorous insider saying goes, “If you want to see God laugh, tell him your plans.” The cherry blossoms are in bloom again. The first four NCAA match-ups begin Tuesday, and the first dance to the Division I championship tips off on Thursday in Buffalo, New York, where snow and below-zero temps are winter staples. “There’s concern about the Buffalo site,” Mark Hollis, chairman of the NCAA Division I men’s basketball committee, said Sunday. “The process is, we’re trying to get everyone in earlier. We’re maneuvering with our travel agents to make that happen for teams and officials.” The schools’ students and fans need to get to those games safely, too. You do not, of course, have to be a hoops fan to appreciate his concern for safety. Travel agents for Jane and John HittheroadJack are on the lookout for warmer climates and, with spring break around the corner, they and their college-age dependents are looking for a break. Fortunately, airlines learned over the weekend that Stella could get her groove on. Airlines already have canceled more than 4,000 flights. The really good news is that the airlines also have granted waivers, but please — please — check with your carrier because there are stipulations. As for the cherry blossoms, chalk it up to trying to fool Mother Nature, who granted a warmer-than-usual winter that led National Park Service predictors to push the peak-bloom dates to Tuesday through Friday. Then, Stella blew that down. Now, the peak date changed to Sunday through March 22. Perhaps Punxsutawney Phil read the “Old Farmers Almanac” before venturing out for his prediction. The Almanac, established in 1792, offered a head’s up. Its prediction was “March 12-20: Periods of rain and snow, cold.” And so it is. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump skeptical of Obama’s political boast President-elect Donald Trump took aim at President Obama’s political prowess Tuesday, pointing out that Mr. Obama couldn’t sway voters in key battleground states during the presidential campaign. “President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. The president said in an interview broadcast on Monday that he believes he would have won a third term against Mr. Trump if he had run again. The Constitution forbids presidents from serving more than two terms. But Mr. Trump pointed out that Mr. Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton in swing states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump won. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/29/congress-boost-troop-levels-duck-gay-rights-fight-/
Congress to boost troop levels, duck gay-rights fight in final defense bill Congress agreed to boost the active-duty strength of the military and maintain a ban on shipping terrorism suspects from Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. in the annual defense policy bill, negotiators said Tuesday — though lawmakers punted on a major fight over gay rights and federal contractors. Republicans had sought to roll back an executive order banning federal contractors from discrimination based on sexual orientation but retreated in the final deal, believing they can win that fight with the new Trump administration instead. “New paths have opened up to address those issues,” a staffer said in briefing reporters on the final agreement, which will be made public on Wednesday and is slated for a vote in the House on Friday. The defense policy bill, known officially as the National Defense Authorization Act, is considered the only must-pass bill of the year, and is always saved for the end of the year to serve as a catchall for unresolved fights. This year, with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, and with President Obama on his way out and about to cede power to a Republican, the final negotiations were made easier. Mr. Obama had threatened to veto earlier versions of the bill over what he saw as meddling with his ability to run the Defense Department. Negotiators said they dropped all of those fights. The only potential sticking point is the bill’s authorized price tag, which is $3.2 billion higher than the White House had sought. Mr. Obama and fellow Democrats didn’t object to spending more on defense, but had insisted it be tied to a corresponding increase in domestic funding — something that doesn’t appear likely. Negotiators avoided a number of tricky issues, including halting a push to have women register for the selective service military draft. The bill that cleared the Senate in June would have required female registration, while the House bill initially had a similar provision that was dropped before it cleared that chamber. The final House-Senate agreement only calls for a study on the effectiveness of the draft. The new bill also breathes life into a special visa program designed to provide a pathway into the U.S. for Afghan citizens who risked their lives helping American forces in the war there. Some 1,500 new visas have been made available, with Afghans engaged in the most dangerous duties getting priority, negotiators said. In terms of personnel, the new agreement would require the army to have at least 476,000 active-duty troops next year, which is a boost of 1,000 over 2016 — but is 16,000 more than Mr. Obama had called for. At 185,000, the Marine Corps has 3,000 more active-duty troops than the president sought, and the Air Force will be 4,000 higher, at 321,000 troops. To pay for the higher troop strength yet contain costs, negotiators said they put off spending on ships and aircraft. The staffers who briefed reporters on the deal said it’s tougher to build back troop strength than it is to kick-start production on equipment. “This is a victory for common sense,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, who had urged his colleagues to forgo a “culture wars” fight on the defense bill. “It’s encouraging to see Congress do its work instead of jumping into a fight about drafting our mothers, sisters and daughters when the military isn’t demanding an end to our all-volunteer fighting force.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/17/tim-ryan-ohio-democrat-challenge-pelosi-house-demo/
Tim Ryan of Ohio to challenge Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader Rep. Tim Ryan announced Thursday that he will challenge Rep. Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the House Democratic Caucus, giving the party’s moderates a rallying point as they try to drag the party back toward the center after last week’s elections. Mr. Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, will struggle to topple Mrs. Pelosi, who said she had commitments from two-thirds of House Democrats. Mr. Ryan doesn’t have much time to peel away her support — the vote is scheduled for Nov. 30, and lawmakers will be in recess next week for the Thanksgiving holiday. But his announcement underscores growing unrest with Mrs. Pelosi, who has helmed House Democrats for 14 years and rarely faced dissent. PHOTOS: 13 Things Liberals Want To Ban “Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929,” Mr. Ryan said in announcing his bid. “This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections.” He said Democrats have lost touch with Americans in the middle of the country — particularly in the Midwest and Rust Belt, which used to be the party’s blue-collar strength. Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania voted for Republican Donald Trump for president, and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania re-elected Republican senators. Overall, Democrats had a bad night, losing the White House, failing to retake either the Senate or House, and sustaining further losses in state legislatures. Mrs. Pelosi shrugged off accusations that she was responsible for the poor showing. The California Democrat said she proved she could lead her party to a majority when it took control in 2007. She said its failure to retake the chamber last week was the fault of others, including FBI Director James B. Comey, who made a late campaign season decision to renew his agency’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Mrs. Pelosi said her party had the right positions for voters but failed to convey the message. “The problem is more with the communication than it was with our policy,” she said. She said the Democratic majority from 2007 through 2011 was never as strong as it seemed because it was infiltrated by a “big boll weevil faction” of conservative Democrats. She remains a clear favorite to win the Nov. 30 vote. “Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me,” she told reporters at a press briefing Thursday on Capitol Hill. “It’s a funny thing in a caucus or any place when somebody challenges you. Your supporters turn out both internally in the caucus and in the country, whether it’s supporters at the grass-roots level, financial supporters, intellectual resources to us.” Undeterred, Mr. Ryan entered the race hours later, lamenting that Democrats have less power now than at any other time in decades. “We have lost over 60 seats since 2010. We have the fewest Democrats in state and federal offices since Reconstruction,” he said. “At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership.” The liberal group MoveOn.Org quickly endorsed Mrs. Pelosi and rejected the notion that the party needed to move to the center. “Progressives are also counting on congressional Democrats to express a populist and inclusive vision for the future that speaks to Americans across lines of race, class and geography,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “We believe that Nancy Pelosi is best positioned to lead House Democrats in this direction, and support her candidacy for Democratic leader.” Christy Setzer, a Democratic strategist, said the showdown in the House Democratic caucus is part of a broader battle over how best to respond to the electoral setback. “Democrats are conducting their autopsy of 2016, and many like Rep. Ryan are taking to heart the lesson that we can’t be a party of coastal so-called ‘elites’ — and must do more to reach the working-class voters who once made up our base,” Mrs. Setzer said. “But it’s a tricky line to walk: The party also can’t ignore the diverse rising majority who are being alienated by the right. It’s not a zero-sum game — we can and must entice both groups.” The National Republican Campaign Committee, meanwhile, rushed to the defense of Mrs. Pelosi, saying, in jest, “No single person deserves more credit for House Republicans’ historic majority than Nancy Pelosi.” “Under Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, House Democrats have become completely irrelevant, and there is no better way to ensure that remains the case than by keeping her as minority leader,” NRCC Communications Director Katie Martin said. “The NRCC offers its full support to Nancy Pelosi as she attempts to fend off this challenge to her failed leadership from within the ranks of her own party.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Samuel L. Jackson says he isn’t moving to South Africa despite Trump victory South Africans were looking forward to seeing whether actor Samuel L. Jackson would turn up after Republican Donald Trump’s presidential win, but it looks like he’s staying put. Several South Africa news websites broke the news to readers this week after the star of movies like “The Hateful Eight” and “Pulp Fiction” informed Trump supporters needling him on social media that he wasn’t serious. “Sit down‚ we might have some bad news for you,” said the Herald Live in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. “It seems that veteran U.S. actor Samuel L. Jackson is in no hurry to leave America … even for South Africa.” Unlike other celebrities who have since reneged on their leaving-the-country pledges, however, Mr. Jackson has a legitimate excuse: He made his comment about moving to South Africa during a sketch in December on ABC-TV’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” in which he played the voice of the “hateful eight ball.” Asked during the skit to predict if Mr. Trump would be the next president, Mr. Jackson replied, “If that mother–– becomes president, I’m moving my black a— to South Africa.” Reminded of his comment by persistent social-media followers, Mr. Jackson said on Twitter, “When you learn the difference between My Actual Opinion & A Kimmel Skit … Maybe we can talk.” Later, an exasperated Jackson told Splash News TV, “Look, everybody keeps saying I said I was leaving.” “I was doing a Jimmy Kimmel skit. I was portraying a Magic Eight Ball. You remember that? Did you see that? So why does everybody think that’s my personal opinion?” Mr. Jackson said in a video posted Thursday on YouTube. So far none of the two dozen celebrities vowing to leave the country in the event of a Trump presidency have followed through, at least not publicly. Those begging off include comedians Chelsea Handler and Amy Schumer, singer Miley Cyrus and the star of HBO-TV’s “Girls,” Lena Dunham. So far, no public word from celebrities such as Cher, Whoopi Goldberg and Barbra Streisand. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

Cmdr. Mike Wagner with the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday the marijuana grow found inside the home southwest of Boulder was illegal, but The Daily Camera reports https://goo.gl/aXxIZY investigators are still trying to determine if drugs played a role in the killings. The bodies of 54-year-old Wallace White, 56-year-old Kelly Sloat-White and 39-year-old Emory Fraker were found April 15, and the possibility of murder-suicide was quickly ruled out. Investigators have said the home was specifically targeted, but they have not released any information about a suspect or a possible motive.

Kickboxing champ sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud HONOLULU (AP) - A former world kickboxing champion has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for tax fraud and other charges. A federal judge in Hawaii sentenced 58-year-old Dennis Alexio Thursday. A federal jury in January 2016 found him guilty of 28 counts of defrauding the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of more than $700,000 in illegally obtained tax refunds. U.S. prosecutors say he used cashier’s checks to launder the money. Another jury in September convicted him of 18 counts in an indictment alleging he used fake documents to steal nearly $200,000 in silver coins and gold bars. Prosecutors say he also stole $16,000 from an internet currency exchange company based in Boston. Defense attorney Richard Gronna says Alexio will appeal.

Andrew Cuomo marked the opening of the first span of a project to replace the Kosciuszko (kuh-SHOOS’-koh) Bridge with a dazzling light show. Thursday night’s show involved LED lights installed on the span that can change color and synchronize to music. It’s the first performance of “The New York Harbor of Lights.” Seven MTA-operated bridges will eventually have these lights. Bridge traffic between Brooklyn and Queens will begin at 11:30 p.m. Thursday. Traffic will go in both directions until the construction of the second span is complete, expected to be early 2020. Sections of the old bridge are scheduled to be demolished this summer. The bridge opened in 1939. The new bridge would be used by up to 200,000 commuters per day.

Top Kansas lawmaker suggests fee on utility bill for schools TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - The Kansas Senate’s majority leader is suggesting that the state impose an extra fee on utility bills to provide new dollars for public schools. Overland Park Republican Jim Denning said Thursday that he’s drafting a proposal to charge residential customers $3 a month on each of their water, electric and natural gas bills. He said he would seek a $10-per-month charge for businesses. Denning doesn’t know yet how much money the plan would raise. He outlined his idea as the House and Senate budget committees had preliminary discussions on budget issues before lawmakers return Monday from an annual spring break. Some lawmakers oppose increasing consumers’ utility bills. Kansas faces projected budget shortfalls totaling $889 million through June 2019 and the state Supreme Court has ruled that education funding is inadequate.

Trump to sign order aimed at expanding offshore drilling WASHINGTON (AP) - Working to dismantle his predecessor’s environmental legacy, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Friday that could lead to the expansion of drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. With one day left to rack up accomplishments before he reaches his 100th day in office, Trump will order his interior secretary to review an Obama-era plan that dictates which locations are open to offshore drilling, with the goal of the new administration to expand operations. It’s part of Trump’s promise to unleash the nation’s energy reserves in an effort to reduce reliance on foreign oil and to spur jobs, regardless of fierce opposition from environmental activists, who say offshore drilling harms whales, walruses and other wildlife and exacerbates global warming. “This order will cement our nation’s position as a global energy leader and foster energy security for the benefit of American people, without removing any of the stringent environmental safeguards that are currently in place,” Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday evening. Zinke said the order, combined with other steps Trump has taken during his first months in office, “puts us on track for American energy independence.” The executive order will reverse part of a December effort by President Barack Obama to deem the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic as indefinitely off limits to oil and gas leasing. It will also direct Zinke to conduct a review of the locations available for offshore drilling under a five-year plan signed by Obama in November. The plan blocked new oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. It also blocked the planned sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska, but allowed drilling to go forward in Alaska’s Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage. The order could open to oil and gas exploration areas off Virginia and North and South Carolina, where drilling has been blocked for decades. Zinke said that leases scheduled under the existing plan will remain in effect during the review, which he estimated will take several years. The order will also direct Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to conduct a review of marine monuments and sanctuaries designated over the last 10 years. Citing his department’s data, Zinke said the Interior Department oversees some 1.7 billion acres on the outer continental shelf, which contains an estimated 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and 327 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas. Under current restrictions, about 94 percent of that outer continental shelf is off-limits to drilling. Zinke, who will also be tasked with reviewing other drilling restrictions, acknowledged environmental concerns as “valid,” but he argued that the benefits of drilling outweigh concerns. Environmental activists, meanwhile, railed against the expected signing, which comes seven years after the devastating 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Diana Best of Greenpeace said that opening new areas to offshore oil and gas drilling would lock the U.S. “into decades of harmful pollution, devastating spills like the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, and a fossil fuel economy with no future. “Scientific consensus is that the vast majority of known fossil fuel reserves - including the oil and gas off U.S. coasts- must remain undeveloped if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” she said. Jacqueline Savitz of the ocean advocacy group ocean advocacy group Oceana warned the order would lead to “corner-cutting and set us up for another havoc-wreaking environmental disaster” in places like the Outer Banks or in remote Barrow, Alaska, “where there’s no proven way to remove oil from sea ice.” “We need smart, tough standards to ensure that energy companies are not operating out of control,” she said, adding: “In their absence, America’s future promises more oil spills and industrialized coastlines.” ___ Follow Matthew Daly and Jill Colvin on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC and https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Actor Diane Guerrero meets immigrant taking refuge in church DENVER (AP) - Actor Diane Guerrero has met with a woman who is seeking refuge from deportation in the basement of a Denver church. Guerrero, who stars in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, met with Jeanette Vizguerra on Thursday and told the woman and her daughters not to make the same mistake she did as a child by remaining silent. Guerrero was 14 when her parents and her older brother were deported to their native Colombia. She decided to stay behind and live with friends. Guerrero was in Denver for a gathering of immigrant rights activists. Vizquerra has been living in the basement of the First Unitarian Church since February out of fear of being deported. She was recently named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people of the year. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/arkansas-executions-halted-due-to-lack-of-drugs/
Future of Arkansas executions in limbo over lethal-injection drug access The final execution in Arkansas’s condensed April timetable was scheduled for Thursday night, but it could be months or even years before the state is able to carry out another one. The Arkansas Department of Correction has been unable to procure additional doses of midazolam, the sedative in its three-drug protocol, to replace those that expire Sunday, a dilemma faced by a growing number of states as pharmaceutical companies balk at having their products used for executions. The result is that Arkansas, which had not executed an inmate since 2005 as a result of a legal battle that was resolved Feb. 21, may have no choice but to change the way it puts prisoners to death, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “States are faced with several choices, most of them problematic,” Mr. Dunham said. “They can continue to try to obtain the lethal injection drugs they currently use; change their execution protocol to permit the use of other drugs; change the method of execution; do nothing; or repeal the death penalty. We’ve seen states follow each of these approaches.” Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson set eight executions to run from April 17-27 in order to beat the expiration date, which would have been the most in an 11-day time period since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. It didn’t work out that way: Four of the eight prisoners won stays of executions or delays. Three inmates were put to death as scheduled. That left 30 inmates on Arkansas’ death row. One of those, 38-year-old Kenneth Williams, was slated to be put to death at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Cummins unit, which would make him the fourth Arkansas inmate to die this month. Williams was sentenced to death for the murder of farmer Cecil Boren after breaking out of prison. During his escape, Williams crashed Boren’s truck into that of a water-delivery driver, Michael Greenwood, killing him as well. He had been serving a life sentence for the 1998 kidnapping and killing of Dominique Hurd, a University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff student. Williams later confessed in prison to committing another murder in 1998. Greenwood’s daughter Kayla Greenwood bought plane tickets for Williams’ 21-year-old daughter Jasmine and 3-year-old granddaughter so that they could see him before he died, the Springfield News-Leader reported. “I told him we forgive him and where I stood on it,” said Ms. Greenwood, who sent a message to Williams through his attorney. “When he found out that we are bringing his daughter and granddaughter to see him and that my mom and dad bought the tickets, he was crying to the attorney.” Robert Blecker, professor at New York Law School and a proponent of the death penalty, has advocated for states to change their method of execution from lethal injection to firing squad, saying the use of drugs is too clinical and morally ambiguous. But the firing squad has another advantage: No such execution has ever been botched, according to Amherst College professor Austin Sarat in his 2014 book, “Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death Penalty.” On the other hand, “lethal injection had the highest rate of botched executions,” at 7.12 percent, according to a graphic prepared by the DPIC. Lethal injection drugs have also been challenged repeatedly in court over allegations that they cause pain or fail to work as designed on all inmates. This month in Arkansas, for example, attorneys argued that the three-drug protocol would be ineffective and result in suffering for two overweight prisoners who suffered from diabetes. One of the inmates weighed about 400 lbs., and the other had had his leg amputated. Courts rejected their appeals, and the inmates were put to death as scheduled on Monday in the first back-to-back execution in any state since 2000. Given the problems with drug protocols, Mr. Blecker said states may eventually return to the firing squad. The problem then becomes what to do about inmates already sentenced to die by lethal injection who insist upon it. “Here’s how I envision the scene playing out: They get smart and they get right morally, and they change the method to the firing squad,” said Mr. Blecker. “But then these guys challenge it, saying, ‘We have a right to be lethally injected, and you can’t lethally inject us because you can’t get the drug.’” States have also looked into creating their own pharmacies and compounding their own drugs, although Mr. Blecker said the argument then becomes that “there’s no assurance it’s safe, etc.” Then there’s the problem with public opinion. Mr. Dunham pointed to a 2015 YouGov poll showing that all methods of execution were viewed as cruel and unusual — except lethal injection. “While most Americans do not consider lethal injection to constitute cruel and unusual punishment, most believe that all of the other execution methods are,” Mr. Dunham said. — This story was based in part on wire service reports.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/trump-moves-reverse-obama-limits-offshore-drilling/
Trump moves to reverse Obama limits on offshore drilling President Trump on Friday will begin to reverse his predecessor’s limits on new offshore drilling, potentially opening up vast new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf for oil-and-gas exploration. White House officials said Mr. Trump will sign an executive order directing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review all aspects of the nation’s offshore drilling regulations. As part of that review, Mr. Zinke will examine President Obama’s five-year ban on any new offshore leases, which would have lasted through 2022, and will make recommendations on whether to open up new areas in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans to drilling, as well as new waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The order also will temporarily prohibit the designation of any new marine monuments off U.S. shores, ending an Obama-era practice of using the century-old Antiquities Act to protect waters from drilling. In justifying the new policy — which came under immediate, scathing attacks from environmentalists and Democrats on Capitol Hill — Mr. Zinke told reporters Thursday night that federal revenue from offshore drilling has dropped from $18 billion in 2008 to just $2.8 billion in 2016. Some of that drop can be attributed to drops in the price of oil, but the Trump administration argues much of it is due to federal regulation. Mr. Zinke said there are both economic and environmental benefits to expanding offshore drilling, and he rejected outright the notion that the U.S. should curb energy exploration solely out of concern for the environment. “It is better to produce energy here under reasonable regulations than to have it be produced overseas with no regulations,” he said. “Environmentally, I can tell you we have the highest standards in the world, and if you doubt that, I invite you to visit some of the energy opportunities in the Middle East and Africa, which are catastrophes as far as the environment is concerned.” The executive order does not immediately open up new areas for drilling, nor does it have any impact on existing oil-and-gas company leases off of U.S. shores. Still, the very idea of expanding offshore drilling ignited a firestorm among Trump critics. Environmentalists pointed to past drilling disasters, such as the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, to argue that allowing even more energy exploration is a foolish move. “Seven years, almost to the day, after offshore drilling caused the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, President Trump is taking aim at expanding this dirty and dangerous industry into new areas like the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans, as well as the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Let me be clear: that would be a huge, bad, stupid mistake,” said Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, a leading conservation group. “I doubt President Trump would want to see Mar-a-Lago, or any of his other coastal resorts, covered in oil.” Ahead of Friday’s official announcement, a coalition of 27 Senate Democrats on Thursday wrote a letter to Mr. Zinke urging him to scrap the plan. They said that current leasing plans will provide more than enough fuel, and they charged that oil companies are doing nothing with some of the leases they already hold. Existing policy “already makes available more than 45 billion barrels of oil for drilling. It makes available more than half of all known oil and natural gas resources on federal lands offshore,” the Democratic lawmakers wrote. “Extracting and burning even these fossil resources would already be disastrous for our climate. But when oil companies are currently holding and warehousing leases … we should first ensure that they are taking full advantage of the areas that are already available before contemplating opening new areas to oil drilling and the threat of a spill.” Energy companies reject that charge and say that not all of the areas they lease contain recoverable fuel. As for environmentalists’ fears, Mr. Zinke said there are legitimate concerns with offshore drilling that must and will be addressed. He didn’t specifically mention the BP spill in 2010 or other environmental disasters, but he vowed that the administration will not expand offshore exploration without first ensuring it can be done safely. “The truth is, we can expect during the review process we will find ways to look at our regulatory requirements that strengthen our safety and environmental policies,” the secretary said.

$30K settlement for Honolulu police excessive force lawsuit HONOLULU (AP) - A $30,000 settlement has been reached in a lawsuit alleging a Honolulu police officer used excessive force in arresting a man reported to be harassing an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. Jamie Kalani Rice’s lawsuit says he stood motionless as an officer used a baton to hit him in the arms, torso and legs in 2014. He was arrested after National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration volunteers called police to report he was harassing the seal at an Oahu beach. Rice’s attorney Richard Gronna calls the settlement made public in court Thursday adequate. It requires City Council approval. Video by the NOAA volunteers shows Rice kneeling next to the seal before walking away as the officer follows. The officer hit Rice with the baton several times until Rice fell to the ground.

West Virginia State sues Dow over groundwater chemicals CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - West Virginia State University has sued Dow Chemical Co. claiming its plant outside Charleston contaminated groundwater under the neighboring university. The suit filed Thursday wants Dow and the plant’s previous owners to clean up the contamination and pay damages. According to the suit, chemicals have been manufactured at the plant, a quarter-mile from the university, since 1947. In between lies the West Virginia Rehabilitation Center, property the school acquired in 2014. The university says the dioxane, dichloroethane and chloroform in the groundwater can vaporize into the air, including in its buildings. President Anthony Jenkins advised students’ parents that the university gets water from a local utility and that nobody on campus drinks, bathes or cooks with the groundwater. A Dow spokeswoman says they didn’t know the suit was filed and declined comment. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/gavin-mcinnes-lauren-southern-headline-free-speech/
Trump supporters headline free speech rally at University of California, Berkeley Trump supporters descended upon the University of California, Berkeley on Thursday to reaffirm the principles of free speech and robust debate after the school canceled a scheduled lecture by conservative author Ann Coulter. Canadian contrarians Gavin McInnes and Lauren Southern headlined a free speech rally at MLK Park and read an excerpt from Ms. Coulter’s planned speech in her stead. “They may be able to stop us from speaking on the campus, they may be able to throw punches, to spray pepper spray, throw bricks at us, but they can’t stop an idea,” Ms. Southern said. “They can’t stop the history of this nation and the determination to defend free speech and protect God-given rights.” Berkeley officials canceled Ms. Coulter’s speech last week citing security concerns and the possibility of violence, but quickly reversed course after a backlash ensued. Despite the university’s assurance that she was welcome, Ms. Coulter said she had to cancel the speech Wednesday after losing the backing of the student group that invited her, Young Americans for Freedom. The free speech rally was mostly peaceful, with protesters and hecklers only sparsely populated in the surrounding area. Among the hundreds of attendees were representatives from Oath Keepers and Bikers for Trump, who said they were there to ensure the event remained peaceful. Many of the participants were clad in black and wore motorcycle helmets. The excerpt from Ms. Coulter’s speech argued against accepting Muslim immigrants and those in need of government assistance. “When Trump merely proposed we stop importing people whose religion teaches them to kill us, the media called him a racist,” Mr. McInnes read. “Republicans said that’s not who we are. They know us so well. There are 7 billion people in the world; we don’t have to take any of them. There’s no constitutional right for the rest of the world to move here. “Immigrants are showing up with a lot of needs and a lot of grievances,” he continued. “Why do we owe them? If you have grievances, go home and address the perpetrators. We owe you nothing. By my reckoning, they owe us.” Mr. McInnes echoed those sentiments in his own remarks, asking why “American citizens, American immigrants and American millennials” aren’t more grateful to live in America. “As an immigrant myself, I gotta say, I’m kind of shocked to get here and see the number of ingrates both within my fellow immigrant community and within the American citizen community,” he said. He also noted that speakers who hold controversial liberal opinions have been allowed to speak on college campuses without the threat of violence. “You have Linda Sarsour giving a speech at CUNY,” he said, referring to the co-chair of the Day Without a Woman Protest. “No problem with that. This is a woman who supports Shariah law. This is a law where women have half the vote of men, a husband can rape his wife, a man can beat his wife.” The cancellation of Ms. Coulter’s speech comes less than three months after rioters set fire to the campus in response to a scheduled lecture from conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart editor. Young Americans for Freedom and the Berkeley College Republicans filed a lawsuit against the university, arguing the school failed to accommodate the club with a safe venue for the speech, giving them no choice but to cancel it. “In effect, our free speech has been stifled because the university has decided not to assist us in making sure the event can occur successfully,” Troy Worden, president of the Berkeley College Republicans, said in a press conference Wednesday. “We aren’t going to have a dangerous event.” For his part, Mr. Yiannopoulos has vowed to return to Berkeley in the fall for a whole week. “My proposed Free Speech Week will proceed as planned later this year,” he said Wednesday on Facebook, breaking out into all capital letters to declare: “I will bring an army if I have to.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Ex-county commissioner pleads guilty to tax charges DEL RIO, Texas (AP) - A former border county commissioner has pleaded guilty to federal tax charges. Ramon V. Ramon had been commissioner of Val Verde County Precinct 1 commissioner from 2003 until Jan. 1. The 64-year-old Del Rio man pleaded guilty to underreporting his total income on federal income tax returns for three separate years. Court records show that, between 2005 and 2012, Ramon accepted about $47,000 in payments from a San Antonio developer, about $10,500 from a group of New Braunfels business interests and $5,000 from a California businessman to manage a Val Verde County real estate project. Ramon admits that he failed to report that income on his income tax returns for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Ramon faces up to three years in federal prison. No sentencing date has been set.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/trump-tower-fated-not-to-rise-in-indonesian-isle-o/
Trump tower fated not to rise in Indonesian isle of the gods TANAH LOT, Indonesia (AP) - Thousands of people flock daily to the centuries-old, sacred Hindu temple at Tanah Lot, a rock formation that juts into the Indian Ocean. An island at high tide and flanked by sheer cliffs, it’s among Bali’s most photographed sites, particularly for the mesmerizing sunsets that transform the waters into a shimmering orange vista. It’s getting a new neighbor, described as “Trump International Hotel and Tower” in the Trump Organization’s promotions for what will be its first resort in Asia. They promise breathtaking views, a super-sized golf course overlooking the temple and an “enchanting and unrivaled getaway from the current luxury hotels” in Bali. For those weary of mere five-star opulence, it offers six. Nothing that one might consider a tower is going to fly on Bali, where height restrictions prohibit structures higher than the island’s plentiful coconut palms - about 15 meters (49 feet). Locals welcome new investment in the popular Indonesian resort island but are determined to preserve their unique traditions. Neighbors are resisting efforts to expand the Trump site. And if a tower ever starts rising, local authorities are ready to flatten it. “If suddenly they build an unapproved tower, of course we will stop them and demolish it,” said Ida Bagus Wiratmaja, head of the district’s development and planning agency. “There are special rules for the temple and the temple area.” Tanah Lot and other temples dotting the cliffs are more than a lure for tourists. They’re the heart of life in the surrounding Beraban village, where tradition and spirituality are woven into daily living. The Balinese are proud that their island’s Hindu culture has flourished for centuries even as later arrivals - Islam and Christianity - supplanted it elsewhere in the Indonesian archipelago. The height restriction is the key regulation the Trump hotel must contend with, since the 100 hectares (250 acres) where it will rise is already occupied by a golf course and aging resort owned by President Donald Trump’s Indonesian business partner Hary Tanoesoedibjo, who also harbors presidential ambitions. At a cost of about $300 million, Tanoesoedibjo’s conglomerate MNC will redevelop the site. The Trump Organization will manage the new property under an agreement made with MNC in 2015. That was before Trump was elected, so it does not conflict with his pledge not to make new business deals as president. The two groups are also working together near the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, to build a super-luxury “Trump Community” in a 3,000-hectare (7,413-acre) mini-city alongside a national park that is one of the area’s last refuges for endangered species. MNC and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment on the Bali project. MNC in March reportedly promised to respect height restrictions and says it is still designing the new resort despite plans to shutter the existing one around the middle of the year. Still, the Trump Organization continued to bill the project as a hotel and tower as recently as Thursday. MNC will also have to work around a temple on the site, leaving it completely undisturbed. “Whatever they build should not deviate from our Hindu culture because it is the soul of the Balinese people,” said Made Rumawa, the religious leader of Beraban. “As a priest, I insist they comply with the rules because they have been set out clearly,” said Rumawa, a towering man clad in white from head to toe. “So, whoever comes, whatever their intention, do not be blind and walk in the darkness.” Plans to expand the land available to the resort, in part to accommodate a larger golf course, are struggling. Villagers said MNC has had an offer on the table since 2015 to buy adjacent land, which is mostly used for growing rice and other crops. Wayan Surata, a former resort worker who helped MNC compile a list of landowners several years ago, said about 80 percent of the owners have rejected it. Ketut Sukarjaya, who works at the old resort and is close to retirement, said land belonging to him and his brother has been in their family for several generations and they had no financial need to sell it. Surata said he was one of the few who has agreed to sell. Pointing to a verdant stretch of land bordering the resort, he said he sold with a “heavy heart” because he urgently needed money for a garment business he had started. MNC’s offer of 150 million rupiah ($11,290) per a Balinese measure of land that is equal to about 100 square meters (1,076 square feet) is far below what villagers believe is fair given the prime location, Surata said. Most think it’s worth three to seven times that. Selling is also a fraught issue because the island’s farmland is gradually being depleted, increasing a lopsided reliance on tourism. In Beraban, about 40 percent of arable land already is being used for housing and tourism. “We are optimistic it will be more difficult to buy land because the people are now more aware that land cannot be created,” said Made Sumawa, the village’s stern-faced guardian of custom and tradition. “The investors wanted to expand the area but after they learned of the people’s character here, they realized it’s difficult to buy the land from them.” ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia contributed to this report. ___ Follow Wright at www.twitter.com/@stephenwrightAP Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/garrett-1st-to-browns-bears-trade-up-for-qb-trubis/
Offensive draft early, QBs prized after Garrett is No. 1 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - With defensive studs everywhere in this draft, NFL teams turned offensive. With an emphasis on quarterbacks. Hardly stunning in a pass-happy league, except that no quarterbacks in this crop have been highly touted. Yet three went in the first dozen Thursday night, with two whopping trades putting the Bears and Chiefs in position to grab QBs. Chicago paid a whopping price to move up one spot to second overall for North Carolina’s Mitchell Trubisky. Kansas City gave up its first-rounder next year to go from 27th to 10th for Texas Tech’s Patrick Mahomes. Altogether, eight of the first dozen picks were to aid offenses, including Clemson QB Deshaun Watson to Houston - which also traded up for a passer. All of which overshadowed the predictable at the top of the draft: Roger Goodell got booed, then Myles Garrett was picked first by the Cleveland Browns. “C’mon, Philly, C’mon,” Goodell said Thursday night amid the boos, not even wincing at the reception. Moments later, he was back onstage announcing the Texas A&M; defensive end’s name. Garrett, a junior and All-American considered the best pass rusher in this crop, is the first Aggie selected No. 1 overall. Garrett was not on hand, but promised Cleveland fans “great things are coming.” Cleveland went 1-15 last season and has holes everywhere. It ranked 31st defensively and had only 26 sacks. Then the Bears sent a third-round pick, a fourth and a 2018 third to San Francisco to switch that one slot and take Trubisky, who started only 13 games for North Carolina. “It was crazy,” Trubisky said. “There was no call. I didn’t think I was going to be picked until the commissioner said my name.” San Francisco was up next, and new general manager John Lynch already was looking good for bringing in such a haul to drop back to No. 3. The 49ers took DE Solomon Thomas from just down the road at Stanford. Next was pretty much an offensive onslaught. “We had a lot of scenarios, but we did not have any scenarios like what’s happened here,” Eagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman said. LSU running back Leonard Fournette, who some scouts compared to Adrian Peterson, went to Jacksonville; new Jaguars boss Tom Coughlin is enamored of powerful running backs. “He’s special,” Coughlin said. “We need playmakers. We need people to put the ball in the end zone. We need to do something about balance. We need to do something about creating a better situation where the quarterback doesn’t have the entire game on his shoulders.” Another LSU player, safety Jamal Adams, whose father, George, was an NFLer, was taken by the New York Jets, one pick after Tennessee, needing an upgrade at wide receiver, selected Corey Davis of Western Michigan. Davis is the FBS career leader in receiving yards with 5,285 and was a key to the Broncos’ turnaround last season. Two more skill position offensive players went seventh and eighth. Receiver Mike Williams, who came off a serious neck injury in 2015 to help Clemson to the national championship last season, was taken by the Chargers. Then Christian McCaffrey, son of former NFL wideout Ed McCaffrey, wound up with Carolina. The Panthers, eager to get back to the form that won them the 2015 NFC title, got a versatile running back from Stanford who also can play receiver and return kicks. Cam Newton sure must be smiling. “Can’t wait to grind every single day for that team, the fans, for everybody there,” McCaffrey said. More picks and more offense followed. A third receiver, John Ross of Washington, was taken by Cincinnati, which desperately needs a complement to A.J. Green. Ross tore a ligament in his left knee in 2015 that didn’t slow him down much. He ran a record 4.2 in the 40 at the scouting combine. The next trade saw Buffalo’s new coach, Sean McDermott, deal with his mentor, Chiefs coach Andy Reid. The Chiefs surged up for … a quarterback. They took Mahomes, whose stock soared in workouts this year. Mahomes comes from a spread attack and will need to learn a pro-style offense, but Kansas City has Alex Smith in place right now. “Right now, Patrick isn’t absolutely ready to play. He’s got some work to do,” Reid said. “But he’s coming into a great room, he has an opportunity to learn from Alex (Smith), which will be a great for him. We have to have some patience with him, but he has tremendous upside.” What KC no longer has is its first-round choice next year, which went in the deal that also saw the Bills get a third-rounder on Friday. Nine of the first 10 picks were underclassmen. Watson, another junior who led Clemson to the national title, landed with the Texans after they moved from 25 to 12, and included their No. 1 selection in 2018 in the trade with the Browns. Houston got out of the big contract it gave Brock Osweiler as a free agent last year by dealing him to Cleveland earlier this offseason. Surprisingly, no one from Alabama was chosen until cornerback Marlon Humphrey went 16th to Baltimore. Two more Crimson Tide players went in the next three picks: DE Jonathan Allen to Washington and tight end O.J. Howard to Tampa Bay. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Texas House OKs plans for future business tax cuts AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - The Texas House has preliminarily approved authorizing cuts to, and the eventual phasing out of, taxes levied on businesses in the future, when the state potentially has shaken off the current oil price slump marring its economy. Angleton Republican Rep. Dennis Bonnen’s bill passed 98-45 late Thursday. A final vote will send it to the state Senate. The bill doesn’t cut taxes in the 2017-2018 budget, which lawmakers are devising and which has been hit by low oil prices. But it could affect future years. The Senate already approved a plan gradually eliminating the “franchise tax” on businesses. That plan mandates future cuts when Texas’ economy grows. Democrats oppose cuts since business taxes help fund public schools. But conservatives want the tax fully eliminated, saying it’s too costly for businesses.

Portland protesters call for reinstating parade canceled over threat of protests Portland “antifascist” groups have called for bringing back Saturday’s rose parade, even though fears of violence from left-wing protesters are what prompted organizers to nix the popular event in the first place. The Direct Action Alliance and Oregon Students Empowered, which had planned to protest the parade in order to counter “Nazis” and “fascists,” urged supporters on Thursday to sign a petition to bring back the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade, held in East Portland. “This community has already been threatened and affected by these radical Christian extremists enough,” said the Direct Action Alliancepost on Facebook. SEE ALSO: Portland parade canceled after protesters threaten to rough up Republicans Both groups insisted they had nothing to do with an anonymous email threatening to shut down the event unless the Multnomah County Republican Party was excluded, but those commenting online were stunned by the protesters’ chutzpah. “Seriously guys? You [expletives] are the reason it got canceled to begin with,” John DeGroff said on Facebook. “Victimizers playing the victim.” Parade organizers cancelled the 11th annual event Tuesday after receiving an email that offered a choice: Bar the local GOP, or “we will have two hundred or more people rush into the parade into the middle and drag and push those people out.” “You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,” said the email from thegiver@riseup.net. Oregon Students Empowered said it had “no affiliation to the letter,” adding “we wish that the parade organizers could have removed these nazis from marching in Portland instead of shutting down the parade for everyone who has nothing to do with it.” The petition posted on Change.org by Diane Gill called for a compromise, asking the Multnomah County Republicans to “proactively exclude those who wish to use the parade to promote hateful, biased, exclusionary messaging against immigrants, the queer community, communities of color and other marginalized groups.” In return, protest groups like “Rise Up, the Direct Action Alliance and/or any other group” were asked to “refrain from committing and/or threatening to commit violence or damage during the parade.” Direct Action Alliance accused the Multnomah County Republicans of planning to allow a “neo-Nazi hate group march in their event,” and linked to a Jan. 30 story in Willamette Week about a protest group called Bible Believers. “We will continue to be a voice for non-violent resistance and we will always defend our community,” the alliance said. More generally, the group has equated supporters of President Trump to Nazis. An April 22 post shows a man wearing a red “Make America Great Again” ball cap against the backdrop of a World War II Nazi soldier raising his hands in surrender when confronted with a bayonet above the caption, “We beat ‘em before, we’ll beat ‘em again!” The alliance also made it clear that it had no problem with taking action at the parade. “The nazis know that we’ll keep shutting their marches down, they are now planning to march within other parades to protect their message of hate and white supremacy — it WON’T work,” said the DAA in an April 22 post promoting the parade protest. “Nazis will not march through Portland.” Multnomah County Republican Party Chairman James Buchal dismissed the alliance’s claims about Republicans working in league with neo-Nazis as “libelous nonsense.” “As a practical matter, we post an event on our website. People show up. We do not take applicants and screen participants,” Mr. Buchal said in an email. “If someone shows up and wants to march with us carrying a swastika, or to shout at parade onlookers and tell them they are going to Hell, you may rest assured we are not going to put up with that.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/david-dao-physician-dragged-flight-settles-united/
Physician who was dragged off flight settles with United The Kentucky doctor who was violently removed from a United Airlines flight reached a settlement with the airline Thursday, less than a month after cellphone video footage of the incident made international news. Lawyers for Dr. David Dao said the settlement was reached at the same time that United issued changes to improve customer service. A provision in the settlement requires its dollar amount to remain private. United issued a statement on its website highlighting 10 changes it will make to improve customer service. The first is limiting the use of law enforcement to safety and security issues only. On April 9 at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, United Express Flight 3411 was overbooked, and airline managers had asked passengers to give up their seats to allow the last-minute travel of four airline employees to Louisville International Airport. When no passengers acquiesced, the managers chose four at random. Three complied, but Dr. Dao refused. Airline managers directed airport security personnel to forcibly remove Dr. Dao. He bloodied his face on an armrest during the struggle, and he was dragged apparently unconscious through the plane as cellphones captured the incident on video. Dr. Dao’s lawyers said he suffered a concussion, injury to his sinuses, a broken nose and two broken teeth. A failure by United CEO Oscar Munoz to properly address and apologize for the incident drew condemnation from the public, media and government officials. “Mr. Munoz said he was going to do the right thing, and he has,” Dr. Dao’s lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, said in a statement. “Dr. Dao has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers.” “Our review shows that many things went wrong that day, but the headline is clear: Our policies got in the way of our values and procedures interfered in doing what’s right,” Mr. Munoz said in a statement. One change United introduced Thursday directs managers to offer passengers up to $10,000 in compensation to voluntarily give up their seats. The federal Transportation Department requires airlines to offer a maximum compensation of $1,350, but the Flight 3411 staff offered only $800 and the cost of meals and hotels. In the immediate aftermath of the April 9 incident, Delta Air Lines said it would offer $10,000 compensation to passengers on overbooked flights. Other changes at United include: ⦁ Reducing the amount of overbooking. ⦁ Not forcing seated passengers to give up their seats unless safety or security is at risk. ⦁ Creating an automated system for soliciting volunteers to change travel plans. ⦁ Ensuring staffers are booked onto flights at least an hour before departure. ⦁ Eliminating the red tape on permanently lost bags by adopting a “no questions asked” policy on lost luggage. In addition, United said it will provide more training for employees and empower them to resolve customer service issues in the moment. The airline also will set up a “customer solutions team to provide agents with creative solutions such as using nearby airports, other airlines or ground transportations to get customers to their final destination.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Portland parade canceled after protesters threaten to rough up Republicans Protesters in Portland, Oregon, have gone from blocking streets and disrupting City Council meetings to threatening to rough up Republicans, and James Buchal is sick of it. The chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, Mr. Buchal accused city officials of kowtowing to “domestic terrorism” after an annual parade was canceled over a warning from radicals who said they would wreck the event unless Republicans were excluded. “[O]nce again, local civic leaders didn’t do enough to prevent organized gangs of criminal thugs from running rampant in the city,” Mr. Buchal said Wednesday in a statement. “According to the criminal elements, they control the streets of Portland.” SEE ALSO: Ann Coulter drops plans to visit Berkeley: Report Organizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade scrapped the Saturday event after receiving an anonymous email offering a choice: Either bar the Multnomah County Republicans or “we will have two hundred or more people rush into the parade into the middle and drag and push those people out.” “You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,” said the email from thegiver@riseup.net. There was little doubt that the protesters could make good on their threat. Left-coast cities like Portland and Berkeley, California, have borne the brunt of the resistance’s wrath since President Trump was elected, despite their status as havens of liberalism. Conservative author Ann Coulter on Wednesday canceled her speech at the University of California, Berkeley after Young America’s Foundation withdrew its support amid threats of violence. “It’s sickening when a radical thuggish institution like Berkeley can so easily snuff out the cherished American right to free speech,” Ms. Coulter tweeted. Like Berkeley, leftist Portland has been rocked since November by a relentless stream of left-wing demonstrations against the president, in some cases resulting in vandalism and arrests. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, cracked down on protesters in March after they repeatedly shut down city council meetings by interrupting council members and staff. Commissioner Nick Fish advised his staff to stop attending meetings over safety concerns. Mr. Wheeler spent two nights in a hotel after activists blocked access to his Portland Heights home. There’s evidence that other Portlanders grow weary of the mayhem. A video posted Jan. 26 by Fox12 Oregon showed onlookers cheering as police broke up masked protesters blocking a busy city street. After the Tax Day protest on April 15, Oregon Republican Party spokesman Kevin Hoar blasted the “pointless perpetual protests by anti-Trump fringe groups.” “It must be frustrating for so many Oregonians who want to enjoy a beautiful, sunny Easter weekend in Portland to have perpetual, professional, astroturf protesters disrupting their day with POLITICS, especially over an issue that only fringe activists care about,” Mr. Hoar said in a statement. The 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association cited “threats of violence” for its decision, saying that it could “no longer guarantee the safety of our community and have made the difficult decision to cancel the parade.” The Direct Action Alliance, which had organized an event on Facebook called “Defend Portland from Fascists at the Avenue of Roses Parade,” said it was “disappointed” by the cancellation, but vowed that “we will always defend our community.” The alliance said that “known members of neo-Nazi and anti immigrant hate groups planned to attend the event.” “[W]e intended to stand between them and those who they wanted to intimidate. We intended to block out their hate and shut down their violence,” said the alliance. It was unclear what was meant by “hate groups.” Members of Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump group that opposes the “antifa” movement, had scheduled a March for Free Speech on the same day in Portland. Mr. Buchal said the local Republican Party had participated in the 11th annual parade in East Portland for years and had expected hundreds of its members to attend. “The bottom line is that Portland needs to choose between supporting terrorist thugs and protecting average citizens who want to participate in their community,” he said. “The Multnomah County Republican Party is not composed of ‘Nazis’ and ‘white supremacists,’ and those who think we would tolerate marching in a parade with folks carrying swastikas are delusional.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Benny Hinn’s Texas headquarters raided by feds The North Texas headquarters of televangelist Benny Hinn was raided this week by U.S. Postal Service inspectors and IRS criminal investigators, according to local news reports. The search began about 9 a.m. Wednesday at Mr. Hinn’s Grapevine offices and continued Thursday morning, NBC 5 reported. The station reported seeing a large number of federal agents walking in and out of the building with boxes, but investigators would not confirm nor deny an investigation into Mr. Hinn. “Today, we are here on official business, we are conducting a search warrant on the premises, basically that’s all I can tell you today,” Special Agent Michael Moseley with IRS Criminal Investigations told ABC News affiliate WFAA on Wednesday. Mr. Hinn’s office said no one from the ministry would be commenting to the media. According to Mr. Hinn’s website, the 64-year-old televangelist is currently touring Europe and was not at the office at the time of the raid. Mr. Hinn, best known for his “Miracle Crusades” faith healing summits, was one of six television evangelists investigated by the Senate Finance Committee in 2007 over the personal use of church-owned luxury goods. All six were all cleared of any wrongdoing in 2011. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/sean-brune-no-estimates-on-how-bad-social-security/
Brune: No estimates on how bad Social Security fraud is Social Security can’t even give a ballpark estimate for how much fraud there is in the program, a top official admitted to Congress on Wednesday — though he insisted they care about the matter and are working to weed out bogus payments, particularly in disability payments. Sean Brune, assistant deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration’s budget office, said they’re trying to become more aware of the problems and looking for new tools to fight back, but said he couldn’t guess at how bad the problem is. “I do not have a dollar amount of the general amount of fraud,” Mr. Brune told the House Ways and Means Committee. The $150 billion-a-year disability program has been touched by several massive fraud rings in recent years, including one based in West Virginia and Kentucky that investigators say filed more than 1,700 fraudulent applications, which could cost the government more than $500 million in bogus lifetime benefits. The government’s comptroller general said Social Security needs to pay more attention to the problem, and needs to figure out where it’s running the biggest risks of fraud. Mr. Brune said the agency is trying to get there, looking to calculate and manage risks. “We have some metrics, we just need to improve them,” he said. Mr. Brune admitted that his agency doesn’t have the power to strip fraudster employees of their pensions — meaning a former Social Security administrative law judge who stands accused of being part of the Kentucky and West Virginia fraud ring will collect a government pension. “We do not have under current statute authority to revoke his pension,” he said. Still, he said that the former judge is convicted the court can order restitution, meaning his pension could be garnished to cover those costs. Rep. Tom Rice, a South Carolina Republican who said the former judge is now living in his district, asked if Congress should pass a law to cancel pensions of Social Security employees who abet fraud. “We’d be happy to talk to you about that,” Mr. Brune said. Social Security has started a program where it has loaned lawyers out to federal prosecutors’ offices to encourage them to pursue fraud cases. In the first six months of fiscal year 2017 that program has won 119 guilty pleas from fraudsters, winning pledges of more than $10 million in restitution. Democrats said that while fraud was a problem, the agency needed to make sure it wasn’t canceling benefits of those who legitimately qualified. They also warned against further budget and staffing cuts at the agency, saying the workload is increasing with the retirement of baby boomers. Nearly 10 million people collect disability benefits, and the average payment is about $1,170 a month, according to the latest statistics. The enrollment number has soared over the last two decades, more than doubling during that time. That’s far faster than the growth rate in the population, leaving some analysts to suspect fraud or other dubious reasons. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump to create new office on VA accountability, whistleblower protection President Trump is expected to issue an executive order Thursday creating an office within the Department of Veterans Affairs to take charge of disciplining or firing incompetent employees and protecting whistleblowers. Mr. Trump will visit the VA headquarters near the White House to create the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which will be aimed at helping VA Secretary David J. Shulkin to discipline or terminate VA managers or employees who fail to carry out their duties, a White House official confirmed. The embattled agency was criticized repeatedly during the Obama administration for failing to discipline employees engaged in wrongdoing. Whistleblowers in the VA also have faced retaliation in what they say is a pattern to silence critics of the agency’s operations. Concerned Veterans for America applauded the announcement, but the group said the effort needs to be backed up with legislation that will help the new office carry out its goals. “President Trump put veterans at the top of his priority list in his first 100 days, and we’re confident he will continue to do everything in his power to take care of them,” said CVA Executive Director Mark Lucas. “This new executive order should be a wake-up call to Congress that the VA is continuing to fail because of employee negligence and misconduct.” The House has passed the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, which would give the agency more authority to discipline employees. But a similar measure faces opposition, mainly from Democrats in the Senate. Mr. Lucas said Mr. Shulkin’s “hands will be tied until Congress passes strong accountability legislation, like the VA Accountability First Act, to let him get these bad VA employees out quickly. The ball is in the Senate’s court.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/adam-schiff-top-dem-house-intel-committee-offers-b/
Top Democrat on House intelligence committee offers bill to limit powers in war on terror The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee introduced a new bill Thursday to revoke the broad war-making powers granted to the president in 2001 and 2002 and to replace them with a much slimmer authorization targeting the Islamic State, al Qaeda and the Taliban. Rep. Adam Schiff’s Authorization for the Use of Military Force would give the president the power to commit ground troops to the fight, but puts a three-year limit on the authorization. “For far too long, Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibility to authorize military action abroad, effectively ceding the war-making power to the executive branch,” said Mr. Schiff in a statement announcing the resolution, which he sponsored along with nine fellow Democrats. President George W. Bush won an AUMF to attack al Qaeda and the Taliban in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, then a year later won authority to oust Saddam Hussein from Iraq. But as the war on terror has expanded to include Libya, Syria, Yemen and other countries, and the focus has shifted from al Qaeda to the Islamic State, legal scholars and a growing number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill say the two original authorizations have been stretched beyond the breaking point. “As deployments to Iraq and Syria increase, and with complicating factors like the recent cruise missile strike against the Assad regime in response to the use of chemical weapons, Congress cannot stand on the sidelines any longer and must debate and vote on any new war,” said Mr. Schiff. “Congress must demand of this Administration and future Administrations the legal justifications for any military action, and hold them accountable for those actions.” For years, Republicans pestered Mr. Obama to revoke the previous AUMFs and come up with a new one. Mr. Obama finally complied in 2015, delivering a severely limited proposal to Capitol Hill — where both Democrats and Republicans quickly shelved it, saying they couldn’t come to a conclusion on how to proceed. Some hawks wanted broader powers to commit troops, while other lawmakers said even Mr. Obama’s limited proposal went too far. It’s not clear that logjam has cleared under President Trump. Meanwhile, Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, joined Mr. Schiff earlier this week in sending President Trump a letter requesting the basis of his legal authority for the airstrike earlier this month in Syria on the Sharat airbase. “It has now been over two weeks since you ordered the strike on the airfield, and your Administration has yet to put forward any detailed legal analyst or justification for that action under domestic and international law,” the letter read.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/haroon-syed-british-teen-admits-plotting-bomb-elto/
British teenager pleads guilty to bomb plot targeting Elton John concert A British teenager pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with contemplating a series of terrorist attacks against targets including an Elton John concert in London last fall. Haroon Syed, 19, pleaded guilty to the preparation of terrorist acts Thursday in London’s Central Criminal Court, opening the door for the possibility of life imprisonment when he’s sentenced at a date to be determined. Prosecutors said Syed had considered conducting terrorist attacks on British soil last year, and the government argued he had been “researching, planning and attempting to source” materials for homemade bombs prior to being taken into custody. An Elton John concert scheduled for the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attack in Hyde Park and Oxford Circus, a London subway station, were both considered potential targets, according to prosecutors. Syed discussed his plans online with undercover agents, providing investigators with plentiful evidence cited prior to securing Thursday’s guilty plea. In one instance, for example, prosecutors alleged Syed said he needed to acquire a machine gun and an explosive vest for “martyrdom.” In another he told the informant about a potential bomb plot, writing: “I might put the bomb in the train and then I’m going to jump out so the bomb explodes on the train…so ask the brother if he can make that type of bomb with button.” Syed never followed through and was apprehended on September 8 before he could ever act, just three days before the Elton John performance. After police took Syed into custody, he reportedly told detectives they could unlock his smartphone by typing in an acronym for the Islamic State terror group. “I.S.I.S - you like that?” Syed said, London’s Independent reported Thursday. Syed’s defense team described him in court documents as “highly vulnerable,” due to factors including family history, lack of education, addiction to violent online games and the arrest and imprisonment of his brother, a convicted ISIS supporter. “The proper response of the state should have been to engage,” said Syed’s attorney, Mark Summers QC. “[T]o steer him away from the path it was feared he was going down, rather than guiding him down it,” he told the court, Metro reported. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 8. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/uk-police-arrest-man-with-knives-on-suspicion-of-t/
Man with knives detained near U.K. Parliament LONDON (AP) — Armed police carrying out a counterterrorism operation Thursday swooped in on a man they said was carrying knives in a bag near Britain’s Parliament and arrested him on suspicion of planning terrorist acts. A European security official familiar with the individual said the suspect was known to British security agencies and was thought to have been inspired by the Islamic State group. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. Authorities haven’t released the man’s name. London’s Metropolitan Police said the 27-year-old suspect was stopped and detained “as part of an ongoing operation” by the force’s counterterrorism unit. PHOTOS: UK police arrest man with knives on suspicion of terrorism No one was injured in the incident, which unfolded just yards from where an attacker killed five people with a vehicle and a knife last month. It sent a jittery jolt through an area that has been on edge since the March 22 attack. Police said knives were recovered during the operation and that there was “no immediate known threat” to the public. Police said the man was being held at a London police station on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. As armed police blocked off Whitehall, a street lined with government buildings that is the main artery of London’s government district, witnesses reported seeing and a man on the ground surrounded by police. Ian Moss, who was traveling on a bus on Whitehall, said the man did not appear to be struggling. “He had police pointing arms at him though,” Moss said. A bearded, black-clad man could later be seen standing on the sidewalk, surrounded by police, before being put into a police vehicle. “He was standing with his back toward the public and his face against the wall,” said witness Chris Kacyk, who arrived in the area just as the suspect was taken into custody. “The guys made sure he could not move. He was tightly cornered by three heavily armed police officers with machine guns and two undercover detectives.” Kacyk said he saw several knives - including one very large one - on the ground next to the suspect’s knapsack. After the arrest, forensic officers pored over the scene. A black bag and at least three knives could be seen on the ground. The man was arrested yards from the gates to Downing Street, where the prime minister’s residence is located. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is campaigning in a national election, was not there at the time. May said the arrest “shows that our police and our intelligence and security are on the alert, as they always are, looking to keep us safe and secure. I think we owe a huge debt of gratitude to these people.” Thursday was Parliament’s last sitting day before Britain’s June 8 election. Security has been increased around Parliament after an attacker drove an SUV into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge on March 22, killing four, before stabbing a police officer to death inside the gates of Parliament. The attacker, Khalid Masood, was shot dead by police. Police believe Masood, 52, a British-born Muslim convert with convictions for violence, acted alone. Police say there has been a surge in knife crimes in London in the past year. Britain’s official threat level from international terrorism stand at the second-highest level, “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely. Police and security services say they face a challenge monitoring hundreds of people of interest, including Britons who went to join IS militants in Iraq and Syria and have returned. Britain’s top counterterrorism officer says 13 potential attacks have been foiled in the last four years. Kacyk said the incident revived memories of the “terrible” March 22 attack. “When I saw this guy driven away, my emotions were boiling,” he said. “I wanted to shout something like ‘go to hell’ because really he was planning something against the public.” ___ Paisley Dodds and Gregory Katz contributed to this story.

Memorial will honor 2 World War I aviators who died on Gettysburg Battlefield The last troops to die on the Gettysburg Battlefield in Pennsylvania did not fight in the infamous Civil War conflict, but in World War I. Capt. George Hamilton and Gunnery Sgt. George Martin — both Marine Corps aviators — died in a plane crash on the battlefield during training maneuvers in June 1922. As the 95th anniversary of the crash approaches, Gettysburg-area residents and the Gettysburg Battlefield Detachment of the Marine Corps League are working to establish a memorial to honor the fallen flyers. “When those Marines got killed here, it made national news,” said Richard Fulton, a Gettysburg writer/historian who helped spearhead the memorial effort. “This is just another piece of history that’s gone by the wayside.” Hamilton, a highly decorated survivor of the Battle of Belleau Wood near the Marne River in France during World War I, was flying a dive bomber over the Gettysburg battlefield with Martin during re-enactment maneuvers. The plane crashed while the pilots attempted to land at a farm in southern Pennsylvania. In the week before the crash, the flyers and 5,500 other Marines marched from Quantico, Virginia, to Gettysburg to perform Civil War re-enactments — a public demonstration that doubled as a training exercise. “They pulled out tanks and dive bombers and re-enacted Pickett’s Charge, World War I style,” Mr. Fulton said. “Really made quite a bit of noise, I’m sure. But that’s why the dive bombers were there.” The demonstrations also helped save the Marine Corps from being disbanded after World War I, said Mr. Fulton, who co-wrote the book “The Last to Fall: 1922 March, Battles & Deaths of U.S. Marines at Gettysburg.” “The Marine Corps was struggling to present its importance to the public in order to save itself,” he said. The famous battlefield was used again during World War II, when it served as a camp for 800 German prisoners of war. While at the camp, prisoners were required to work for local farmers. The cheap labor helped save the area’s agricultural economy, Mr. Fulton said. The memorial, which is slated for a dedication in June, is to honor the two flyers who have been “buried in the focus of the Civil War,” he said. “This whole town has been kept in this little warp of three days in 1863 because of the battlefield being here,” he said. “So a lot of the other historical events that have happened here have been forgotten.” The Gettysburg Battlefield Detachment of the Marine Corps League set up a GoFundMe web page to raise $7,500 for the memorial. The page had raised more than $2,750 as of Tuesday. Mr. Fulton said the memorial will include historical facts about the pilots and the crash. The Gettysburg Heritage Center, a gift shop and museum dedicated to Gettysburg history, donated a portion of its property near the crash site for the memorial. Center President Tammy Myers said the exhibit honoring Hamilton and Martin will help tell a lesser-known story of Gettysburg. “Even though most of our emphasis in the past has been on the Civil War, it’s nice to paint a broader picture of what’s happened here,” she said. Any extra money raised for the memorial will be donated to the Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania Foundation, Mr. Fulton said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Powerful figures in Bollywood films confront violence against women in India NEW DELHI — At the climax of “Anaarkali of Arrah,” the new Bollywood film about a folk artist who specializes in suggestive dances and bawdy songs, the brash heroine calls out a powerful college chancellor for groping her during a performance. “She tells him, ‘Whether she is your wife or a whore or less than a whore, don’t touch a woman without asking,’” says 29-year-old Swara Bhaskar, an established star in the Indian film firmament whose portrayal of the unapologetically sexual Anaarkali has drawn praise from film critics and feminist commentators throughout the country. Featuring a female protagonist and delivering a clear message of female empowerment, “Anaarkali of Arrah” “is among a wave of women-centric films sweeping Bollywood, by some measures the largest film industry in the world. The films are helping fuel an unprecedented debate in India about violence against women as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has called for — and sometimes violently promoted — a return to traditional values in Indian society. “The plot turns on a powerful man demanding that [the heroine] come to his bed, and she says ‘No,’” said Shubhra Gupta, author of “Fifty Films that Changed Bollywood,” a history of the Indian film industry from 1995 to 2015. “She may or may not be peddling her body, but when she says ‘No,’ she means ‘No.’ That is a huge statement.” It’s also a huge change from Bollywood’s treatment of women as self-sacrificing mothers, virginal heroines or doomed vamps, said actress Richa Chadha, who played the foul-mouthed moll of a rustic criminal in the 2012 film “Gangs of Wasseypur.” “Earlier, women often appeared just for a song or a molestation scene that was sort of strangely gratifying,” the 30-year-old actress said. “The aspiration of the heroine was purely to get married — often our films ended with the marriage.” In contrast, more recent films such as “Queen” in 2014 have focused on powerful women who don’t necessarily need men. In “Queen,” the female lead takes a European “honeymoon” by herself after her fiance jilts her. “With every alternate movie revolving around a woman character, feminism is being redefined in the hitherto male-dominated industry these days,” critic Giridha Jha wrote in the magazine Outlook India this month. “No longer does one see any female protagonist fitting into the stereotypes of Mother India with no gray shades whatsoever in her character, nor do we encounter any damsel in distress waiting for her prince charming to rescue them,” Mr. Jha wrote. “What the audience, instead, has today is a surfeit of powerful roles played by young actresses from the millennial generation who have no qualms in wearing their attitude or sexuality on their sleeves with aplomb.” The trend spans several traditional Bollywood genres. Last year, a bevy of crime dramas centered on strong, independent female leads. “Pink” is a courtroom drama about sexual harassment that brought the debate over consent to the big screen for the first time to Indian mass audiences. In “Dear Zindagi,” the unmarried heroine lives alone and sleeps with several men. “Dangal” tells the story of the rise of India’s most successful female wrestlers, sisters hailing from a state where female feticide remains common. This year, Taapsee Pannu, the 29-year-old star of “Pink,” plays a secret agent in the title role of “Name: Shabana,” who is recruited to the job by the promise that the clandestine agency will help her take revenge against the men who killed her friend in an altercation over sexual harassment. “Now people are waking up to the fact that heroism is not about a gender,” Miss Pannu said. Another current film causing a buzz is “Maatr” (Mother), a rape revenge fantasy starring Raveena Tandon, a 42-year-old actress whose heyday was in the 1990s. The films mirror debates occurring in Indian society. National debate Since the infamous gang rape in Delhi in 2012, when the assailants lured a 23-year-old woman and her friend onto a private bus and raped her, India has enacted strict laws against stalking and other crimes against women. But lawmakers have stopped short of criminalizing marital rape, and many pundits, politicians and right-wing activists continue to frame the discussion of violence against women in moral or patriarchal terms. A post-2012 slogan posted on many taxicabs, for instance, presents women’s “honor” as something that is a man’s duty to protect. As a result, Indians are discussing and disagreeing over consent and sexual harassment more widely and publicly than ever before. Across the country, Hindu nationalist vigilante groups — often supporters, though not necessarily members, of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party — have attacked young men and women socializing in bars. Other groups have launched an organized campaign against interreligious romances that they say are the result of an orchestrated program of “love jihad” — Muslims supposedly converting Hindu girls to Islam by wooing them romantically. The firebrand Hindu cleric Mr. Modi recently selected as the chief minister of the country’s most populous state, Yogi Adityanath of Uttar Pradesh, has cracked down on romance in the guise of a battle against sexual harassment on the street. Critics say “anti-Romeo squads” — catcallers are known in the local slang as “roadside Romeos” — have targeted canoodling young couples as often as they stop unwanted advances. India’s censor board this year barred a film called “Lipstick Under My Burqa” about four unfulfilled women who take charge of their sexuality, saying, “The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life.” “Where it comes to women, this [group] would like them to be back in the kitchen,” said the film critic Ms. Gupta. “That’s what Bollywood has been working against in its own way.” For Miss Bhaskar, “Anaarkali” marked a step forward because the film eschews the weepy, apologetic tone of earlier movies centered around social issues. The title character “is unapologetic about the fact that she is sexually promiscuous and sexually free,” said Miss Bhaskar. “She’s not a victim, which is the way you usually see female sexuality depicted in India.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/boris-johnson-says-uk-likely-strike-syria-if-asked/
Boris Johnson says U.K. likely to strike Syria if asked by U.S. LONDON (AP) — Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Thursday that the U.K. will probably join the United States in further military action against Syria if asked to do so, whether or not Parliament gets a vote on it. Johnson said it would be “very difficult to say no” if the U.S. sought British help for a military mission against the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. British lawmakers in 2013 rejected a request by then-Prime Minister David Cameron to authorize U.K. airstrikes in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Britain is part of an international coalition targeting the Islamic State group in Syria, but has not taken military action against Assad. Asked if Parliament would be asked to approve any new military deployment ahead of time, Johnson said “I think it would be very difficult for us to say no. How exactly we were able to implement that would be for the government, for the prime minister.” Parliament will be dissolved next week ahead of Britain’s June 8 election, so lawmakers would not be able to vote on a request for military assistance before then. President Donald Trump ordered a cruise missile attack against a Syrian air base earlier this month in response to Assad’s apparent use of a banned nerve agent against a rebel-controlled area. U.S. officials have said further attacks are likely if Assad uses chemical weapons again. Johnson’s remarks appeared intended to signal to voters that the Conservative government is tough on security and defense. He contrasted the stance to that of opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a foreign-policy dove who wants Britain to give up its nuclear weapons. Writing in The Sun newspaper, Johnson called Corbyn “a mutton-headed old mugwump” with “no grasp of the need for this country to be strong in the world.” Corbyn said he would not be “reduced to personal name-calling,” and said the priority for Syria was finding a political solution to the conflict. “We approach this in a responsible, serious way — I leave that kind of language to others,” he said.

Trump threatens to terminate NAFTA unless U.S. gets a winning deal President Trump said Thursday he was giving Mexico and Canada a chance to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, but warned them that he was ready to pull out if it wasn’t rewritten as a winning deal for the U.S. In backing away from the NAFTA exit, Mr. Trump nevertheless checked off a top item on his 100-day agenda by forcing Mexico and Canada to the bargaining table over the three-country trade deal that has been the bane of the president’s blue-collar base. The maneuver even won begrudging support from Mr. Trump’s foes within the Republican establishment, who admitted the decades-old free trade zone needed to be updated. “I decided rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,” said Mr. Trump. “If I’m unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we’re going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.” The administration had been preparing to quit the deal using an escape clause known as Article 2205. That prompted Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call Mr. Trump and ask instead for a NAFTA redo. “We have to make a deal that is fair for the United States. They understand that,” said Mr. Trump in the Oval Office while meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. Mr. Trump stressed that he was still willing to quit the deal. He later added that the renegotiations were already underway. “It’ll start very soon. It’s actually starting today,” he said. Fixing NAFTA or getting the U.S. out of it was a prominent campaign promise for Mr. Trump. It topped his 100-day agenda for action to protect American workers that he promoted during the race. Since taking effect in 1994, the free trade zone created by NAFTA has been blamed for the rapid decline of American manufacturing and job losses as companies moved factories to lower-wage Mexico. It’s also blamed for suppressing U.S. wages. Mr. Trump’s tough talk on trade and NAFTA in particular helped fuel his support across the Rust Belt, which sealed his victory in November. Tackling NAFTA followed a series of get-tough moves on trade by the Trump administration, including slapping tariffs on Canadian soft lumber exports and launching investigations of imported steel and aluminum. The administration was ready to begin the exit from NAFTA within days. Under Article 2205, which allows any of the parties to unilaterally drop out, the exit would have been completed in six months. Mr. Pena Nieto and Mr. Trudeau phoned the White House Wednesday evening to ask Mr. Trump to enter talks on NAFTA rather than quit, a move that would have left America’s neighbors in an economic lurch. Mr. Trump said his “very good” relationships with Mr. Pena Nieto and Mr. Trudeau, as well as his respect for their countries, prompted him to give renegotiation a chance. He said he told them “let’s see if we can make it a fair deal, because NAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States. It’s been very good for Canada. It’s been very good for Mexico. But it has been horrible for the United States.” Mexico and Canada gave a more subdued description of the call, but all the parties said the result was consensus on the need to “modernize” NAFTA. “During the call, both Presidents spoke of the shared goal of modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement,” said a statement form Mr. Pena Nieto’s office. “The leaders agreed on the advisability of maintaining the North American Free Trade Agreement and working with Canada to carry out a successful renegotiation for the benefit of the three countries.” NAFTA hasn’t been all bad for the U.S. About one-third of all U.S. merchandise exports go to Mexico and Canada, and exports from American service industries and from the agriculture sector increased dramatically under the agreement, noted the conservative Club for Growth, which advocates free trade policies. The proposed U.S. pullout also faced resistance from free trade Republicans in Congress. “We should improve NAFTA, not abandon it,” Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said on the Senate floor after Mr. Trump’s announcement. He pointed to Arizona’s flourishing trade with Mexico, which exceeded $15 billion in 2016 and supports about 100,000 jobs in the Grand Canyon State. “The bottom line is that trade is good for American businesses, it’s good for American workers, and it’s good for American consumers,” he said. “Trade is not a zero-sum game where one party wins and the other party loses. Free trade benefits everyone. I hope that we remember this as we look toward NAFTA’s future.” Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Mr. Trump was taking the right approach in moving cautiously to revamp “a complex set of institutional and economic relationships that have developed over the past 25 years.” “NAFTA has created millions of U.S. jobs that are now dependent on that trade. However, as technological advances and shifting global dynamics reshaped the business landscape, NAFTA has remained largely unchanged,” he said. “We commend the administration’s intent to update and reform NAFTA to ensure that U.S. interests and workers are protected, and to bolster our competitiveness. However, we should remain cautious about taking extreme steps that could damage American businesses and the overall U.S. economy,” said Mr. Grumet. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/13-reasons-why-controversial-drama-about-teen-suic/
‘13 Reasons Why,’ controversial drama about teen suicide, gets strict new rating in New Zealand Netflix’s popular “13 Reasons Why” may well get renewed for a second season, but the controversial drama about a teenage bullying victim who commits suicide has garnered a stricter rating by authorities in New Zealand over concerns that the subject matter is inappropriate for teenagers. “The country’s Office of Film & Literature Classification has created a new category for the show, which will now be known as RP18,” explained the BBC Thursday, noting that Pacific island nation has the “highest rate of teen suicide in the world.” The new classification means that it is illegal to show the content to a viewer under the age of 18 unless he or she is watching it with a parent or guardian. Previously there were only two such classifications in this category, RP13 and RP16, which set age restrictions at 13 and 16 respectively. While the drama has “significant merit” for “address[ing] issues that are highly relevant to young people, including suicide, sexual violence, bullying, and slut-shaming,” the Film & Literature Classification office said on its website, the portrayal of the main character’s suicide was the impetus for its decision, they explained. “Hannah’s suicide is presented fatalistically. Her death is represented at times as not only a logical, but an unavoidable outcome of the events that follow,” said the film board’s official blog. “Suicide should not be presented to anyone as being the result of clear headed thinking. Suicide is preventable, and most people who experience suicidal thoughts are not thinking rationally and therefore cannot make logical decisions.” The blog post concluded with a note that classification office hopes the rating serves to balance out the importance of raising awareness of teen suicide with the right of parents to safeguard their teenagers’ emotional welfare. “This classification allows the intended audience of young people to continue to access the series, while providing the necessary intervention of adult supervision in order to keep them safe and sufficiently navigate the relevant but troubling issues that we acknowledge as a part of their lived reality.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

China bans Muslim names like ‘jihad’ to ‘curb religious fervor’ The Chinese government has banned more than two dozen Islamic names in an attempt to “curb religious fervor” among its Muslim minority population. “Jihad,” “Muhammad,” and “Arafat” are a small sampling of names that are prohibited for over 10 million Uighurs in China’s western region of Xinjiang, The New York Times reported. A “List of Banned Ethnic Minority Names” was provided to The Times and confirmed by security officials in Urumqi and other cities. SEE ALSO: ‘Allah’ surname fight for couple’s daughter sparks Georgia lawsuit Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, lamented the “increasingly hostile” rules for China’s Muslim population. “Uighur people have to be cautious if they want to give their children names they are happy with, and at the same time avoid punishment from the government,” the activist said. Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, called it “the latest absurd restriction that the Chinese government has imposed on people in Xinjiang.” Cultural battles over Islamic names is not endemic to China. A case in the U.S. involving a Georgia couple was recently resolved when the state reversed course and issued a birth certificate with the surname “Allah” for their daughter. Elizabeth Handy and Bilal Walk turned to the ACLU of Georgia in March over a protracted legal battle with the Peach State. Their 3-year-old daughter was denied the name Zalykha Graceful Lorraina Allah until Friday. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

Law review article explores legal avenues to prosecute ‘stealthing,’ men removing condoms during sex A phenomenon of men removing condoms during intercourse is putting women at risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, according to a paper published in the Columbia Journal of Gender and Law. “Stealthing,” is the intentional and non-consensual removal of condoms during sex, and its legal and health implications was explored in a paper by Alexandra Brodsky. The paper includes anecdotes of women who have experienced “stealthing,” and documents an online subculture of men who praise the practice, CBS News reported Wednesday. “Since the article was published just this past weekend, I’ve been really overwhelmed by the number of emails and tweets and personal messages I’ve received saying ‘that happened to me,’” Brodsky told CBS. In the paper, Brodsky highlights legal avenues to prosecute “stealthing” as a form of sexual assault and to pursue justice for victims in both criminal and civil proceedings.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/republicans-progress-health-care-after-key-changes/
House Freedom Caucus endorses Republicans’ revised health care plan; centrists still wary House Republicans are trying to rally support for their new Obamacare repeal and won’t rush a vote this time, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday. Meanwhile, Democrats, enraged over the return of the health care fight, are threatening to try to block a spending bill to keep the government open into next week, saying they don’t want to see Congress rush a slew of bills through just to beat an artificial Saturday deadline marking the 100th day since President Trump took office. Mr. Ryan said nothing has been scheduled on health care, though he said Republicans are making “very good progress” in winning over new supporters. “We’re gonna go when we have the votes,” Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said. Hard-line conservatives who balked at the first repeal attempt signed onto the bill en masse Wednesday, after leaders embraced changes negotiated by the House Freedom Caucus and Rep. Thomas MacArthur, a centrist from New Jersey, designed to cut costs for healthier Americans. That left holdouts in the centrist Tuesday Group as the main target of lobbying Thursday, even if few seemed to be gravitating toward the bill. At least one — Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado — shifted in the opposite direction, from a “yes” vote to someone who is still mulling his stance. Still, members of the Freedom Caucus said their support should put the House GOP within striking distance of the 216 votes needed for passage. “I can’t say how many Tuesday Group people have switched from ‘yes’ to ‘no,’ but based on previous whip counts, I would think that we would be very close,” Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican, said. The White House is pushing for a vote as soon as possible, though Democratic leaders said GOP moderates who acquiesce to the pressure will face blowback at home after the Congressional Budget Office estimated the underlying GOP bill would result in 24 million fewer people holding insurance a decade from now. “You’ll pay a huge price in the 2018 election if you vote for it,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said. The CBO won’t have a score of the revised bill this week or next, meaning that if Republicans schedule a vote before then, they’ll do it blind to the changes their bill would mean. The MacArthur amendment would let states opt out of parts of Obamacare requiring insurers to cover “essential” benefits such as maternity and mental health care or prescription drugs. States can also waive rules requiring insurers to charge healthy consumers the same amount as sicker consumers, so long as states set up risk pools to subsidize those priced out of the market, since insurers still cannot deny people with preexisting medical conditions. Doctors’ groups, labor unions and influential lobbies that opposed the GOP’s initial plan, dubbed the American Health Care Act, sharpened their attacks after reviewing the text. Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Associated, said the recent changes “would dramatically worsen the bill.” “We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage,” American Medical Association CEO James L. Madara wrote to House leaders. “Nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the underlying bill.” Yet Mr. Ryan said the biggest mistake his members could make at this point is retreating from their repeal vow. “We promised that we would do this. If you violate your promise, if you commit the sin of hypocrisy in politics, that’s the greater risk, I think, to a person’s seat,” Mr. Ryan said. Rep. Chris Collins, New York Republican and a key Trump ally, said he’s tried to persuade his Northeast colleagues into the “yes” column by noting their states probably won’t apply for waivers or enforce their own stringent requirements on insurers. Campaign opponents will find something to attack them on in 2018, he said, but probably not this. “That’s going to be a waste of their money,” he said. “I’m just trying to soothe the waters, to remind people that are afraid of their next election.” ⦁ Sally Persons contributed to this report.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/bryan-cranston-autobiography-life-parts-left-signe/
Cranston leaves signed copies of autobiography in random shops You would think that an award-winning actor, director, producer and screenwriter would be thankful for some downtime, but Bryan Cranston, 61, cannot stop creating. Beloved for his standout roles in “Breaking Bad” and “Malcolm in the Middle,” the veteran actor and Oscar nominee has created and executive-produced Amazon’s new crime drama, “Sneaky Pete,” and also stars in Crackle’s animated comedy “SuperMansion.” When he’s not appearing on the big screen, (most recently in “Power Rangers”), Mr. Cranston is on a book tour for his memoir, “A Life in Parts,” which quickly became a New York Times best-seller. At the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, Mr. Cranston spoke about his autobiography, and he shared stories from his vibrant personal and professional life with The Washington Times. Question: I heard you randomly left signed copies of your books in airports. Have you heard from anyone who received one? Answer: It was just a fun thing to do. It was a lark; I did it early on in the book tour. I just wanted to give a gift. I would sign it, buy it, and sneak it back onto the bookshelf. I did it in every airport, or every place where I could find the book. There were a lot of tweets and news reports and interviews where they bring it up and show pictures of the book. Q: What was the experience like writing the book? A: I enjoyed it. It was a chance for me to be creative without being in the public eye. I get tired of being in the public eye; it was rather exhausting at times. What I wanted to do is to be able to refocus on stories that I have told before, stories that I have never told, and have the responsibility now to go back in and really be detailed about what was happening with me emotionally [and] intellectually, and lay it all out there. I thought it would be a futile exercise to withhold something. There are a lot of intimate things that I reveal — some things I am not proud of, some things I am. You read about the insecurities and the triumphs of life. It was very cathartic. Q: Did you show it to your wife before you turned the manuscript in? A: She definitely read it, and so did my brother and sister. I had a lot about them in it, and I wanted to make sure the details were correct. I didn’t want them to be offended about anything. It helped a lot to [with] some recollections. Q: And you recorded an audio book for it. Was that difficult? A: It was harder than I thought. I don’t think I will do it again. I would hear my voice, [which was] like sending the reverberating back into your brain. It’s almost like — you know when you are on a bad phone connection, when you say something, and you can hear your [own] voice again? It was almost like that. I wouldn’t be able to get a fluid sentence or two out. It was like, oh, my God! Q: If someone would voice an audio book for you, who would you want? A: Morgan Freeman! Q: What do you want to do next? A: I need to slow down a little bit. I did a lot this year, and I have a lot of things coming up again. Each thing takes a lot of energy, and then energy to sell it. I just feel like at times I am breathing in my own exhale. Like I am just kind of working in a bubble. I know that it doesn’t behoove me as an actor, certainly, but as a person, I want to be able to continue to explore and learn things, whether or not they have anything to do with the character I am playing. I just want to wander the streets in Budapest. I want to be alive. Q: Where do you still want to travel to? A: Africa. And I would love to go to the Scandinavian countries. Q: How did you get involved with producing “SuperMansion”? A: I was looking to expand and try things as a producer in the latter few years of “Malcolm in the Middle” as well as “Breaking Bad,” and it’s worked out. I enjoy supporting other writers and their visions. I read everything and give notes and try to offer suggestions, but the bottom line is that it’s really up to them, as it should be in the collaborative framework of [each project]. Q: Now that you are producing and directing, why are you putting so much pressure on yourself? A: I mean, the simple answer is I don’t play golf. I work, and I go home, and that’s basically it. I want to be with my wife and family, or I’m working. It’s not laborious to me. As you know, I love storytelling.So get me involved in any aspect of storytelling, and if it’s compelling to me, I’d like to be a part of it. “A Life in Parts” is now available.

United Airlines raising limit on payments to bumped flyers to $10,000 DALLAS (AP) — United Airlines says it will raise the limit — to $10,000 — on payments to customers who give up seats on oversold flights. It’s also increasing training for employees as it deals with fallout from the video of a passenger being violently dragged from his seat. United is also vowing to reduce, but not eliminate, overbooking — the selling of more tickets than there are seats on the plane. The airline made the promises Thursday as it released a report detailing mistakes that led to the April 9 incident on a United Express plane in Chicago. United isn’t saying whether ticket sales have dropped since the removal of a 69-year-old passenger by three airport security officers, but the airline’s CEO admits it could be damaging.

Apple again seriously exploring launch of peer-to-peer payment service: Report Apple is again seriously considering the launch of its own peer-to-peer payment service, tentatively called Apple Cash, as early as this year, tech-news website Recode reported Thursday. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is also looking to ink a deal with Visa for prepaid debit card accounts, Recode said. “People would be able to use the Apple cards to spend money sent to them through the new service, without having to wait for it to clear to their bank account,” Recode explained, noting that if implemented the debit card “may only come in a digital form” and be tied to the iPhone’s wallet application. Company sources who spoke to Recode were conflicted on their optimism about the proximity of Apple Cash’s rollout, and it’s notable that the company considered a similar launch in 2015 before it fizzled out. Recode’s scoop on Apple Cash comes on the heels of reports that the next generation of the company’s iPhone will likely be delayed, with the new iPhone 8 launching as late as November rather than September.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/ransomware-surge-yields-big-revenue-cyber-extortio/
Ransomware surge yields big revenue for cyber-extortionists, American targets suffer most: Report Growing pay-offs and a high return rate have made ransomware the most dangerous criminal threat currently facing businesses and consumers connected to the Internet, security researchers warned in a new report Wednesday. Ransomware infections detected by Symantec, an American security firm, increased by 36 percent in 2016 over the year before, the company said in its “Internet Security Threat Report” published Wednesday, evidenced in part by an array of recent cyberattacks suffered by targets ranging from colleges and law enforcement to hospitals and city governments. In the event of ransomware infections, vulnerable computers are typically rendered unusable until its intended user pays a ransom to the responsible extortionist, usually in the form of untraceable cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. And as the number of ransomware infections detected surged in 2016, so did the amount being sought by cybercriminals, according to Symantec. The average ransom demanded spiked from $294 in 2015 to $1,077 in 2016, amounting to an increase of about 266 percent spike, the company said. “So many people pay the ransom, criminals haven’t figured out a level people will not pay,” Kevin Haley, director of Symantec Security Response, told The Hill on Wednesday. “We may see that average go even higher until that price ceiling is discovered when so many people aren’t willing to pay that much. But we haven’t hit it yet,” he added to CyberScoop. About a third of worldwide ransomware infections detected last year targeted computers in the U.S., Symantec said. Incidentally, Americans are willing to pay a ransom to hackers about 64 percent of the time, according to the report – nearly double the global average of 34 percent. “That’s a phenomenal number,” Mr. Haley told CyberScoop. “I always compare it to direct mail where if you get a 1 percent rate you’re doing really good. These guys get a 34 percent return rate. Extortion really pays.” A survey of businesses previously infected with ransomware found that half of victims agreed to pay extortionists over $10,000, IBM Security reported last year. Indeed, the Los Angeles Community College District paid nearly triple that amount the following month after a local college was sideline by a ransomware infection. Just this week, meanwhile, a ransomware attack reportedly infected city computers utilized by the government of Newark, New Jersey. Separately, a European security firm said Wednesday that ransomware will likely continue to surge unless American prosecutors narrow their sights. “If the U.S. pursues all the forms of potentially illegal payments, ransomware’s growth could be abated. Otherwise, we expect to see the new ransomware families we discovered in 2017 at least double,” Sean Sullivan, Security Advisor at F-Secure, said in a statement. Wannabe hackers can purchase “ransomware toolkits” on the internet underground for as little as $10 and as much as $1,800, according to Symantec. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Assange: Trump declared ‘war on free speech’ by rekindling WikiLeaks probe The Trump administration’s recent escalation of an Obama-era probe into WikiLeaks has amounted to a “war on free speech,” the website’s editor, Julian Assange, said Tuesday. Mr. Assange defended WikiLeaks against fresh claims from the Trump administration in an op-ed published Tuesday in The Washington Post, taking particular aim at CIA Director Mike Pompeo and his recent characterization of WikiLeaks as a “non-state hostile intelligence service” overseen by a “fraud,” “coward” and “enemy.” The CIA director’s assault, Mr. Assangewrote, “mirrors attempts throughout history by bureaucrats seeking, and failing, to criminalize speech that reveals their own failings.” In going after WikiLeaks, he added, Mr. Pompeo “chose to declare war on free speech rather than on the United States’ actual adversaries.” “The world cannot afford, and the Constitution does not permit, a muzzle placed on the work that transparency organizations do to inform the American and global public,” Mr. Assange wrote. WikiLeaks has been the subject of an ongoing Justice Department probe since its publication of classified U.S. government and military documents in 2010, though prosecutors have failed so far to formally indict Mr. Assange or anyone else related to his website with one exception: Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, the source of the 2010 leaks. The Justice Department reportedly widened that probe after WikiLeaks began publishing leaked CIA files last month, however, and Mr. Pompeo, President Trump and his attorney general have since signaled their support for arresting Mr. Assange. On Mr. Pompeo’s part, he devoted a significant chunk of his first public speech as CIA director lashing out against WikiLeaks and its founder this month, labeling Mr. Assange as a “narcissist” with no First Amendment rights. “As a legal matter, this statement is simply false,” Mr. Assange wrote of the latter claim Tuesday. “It underscores just how dangerous it is for an unelected official whose agency’s work is rooted in lying and misdirection to be the sole arbiter of the truth and the interpreter of the Constitution.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions, meanwhile, said last week that arresting Mr. Assange “once and for all” is a high priority for his Justice Department. Asked for his take afterward, Mr. Trump on Friday said charging Mr. Assange was “OK with me.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/wilbur-ross-announces-investigation-into-imported-/
Commerce Secretary Ross announces investigation into imported aluminum Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced Wednesday that the Trump administration was launching a new investigation into imported aluminum, looking at the impact a flood of imports has on U.S. economic and defense security. The probe, similar to one initiated last week into steel, will determine whether subsidies or other unfair practices in countries such as China justify imposing countervailing duties or other measure to protect U.S. industries. “Imports have been flooding in to the aluminum industry,” Mr. Ross said. The Commerce Department has 270 days to complete the investigation and make a recommendation to the president. But Mr. Ross said the investigation likely would be completed before the deadline. The probe by the Commerce Department, known as a Section 232 investigation, is part of a series of get-tough moves on trade. The Trump administrant also is expected to soon take steps to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Ross wouldn’t confirm a timeline for tackling NAFTA but said the aluminum investigation and other moves stemmed from Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on bad trade deals. “The president said he was going to be tougher on trade,” said Mr. Ross. “This follows quite logically with him following though on his campaign promises.” Aluminum imports have a direct impact on the U.S. military. Mr. Ross noted that high-quality aluminum is used in the F-35 and F-18 fighters, C-17 transport aircraft, and in armor plating for a variety of military vehicles, vessels and missiles. “The problem we have is there is only one American smelter that produces the high-purity aluminum needed for these uses. Just one,” he said. “Even worse, eight U.S. smelters have either closed or curbed production since 2015. There are only two U.S. smelters fully operational as we stand here today.” A glut in global aluminum supply, some of it driven by countries that subsidize production, has driven down prices and U.S. producers claim they have been unfairly undercut. U.S. aluminum output has dropped to 1955 levels, said Mr. Ross. He said that China was a major playing in aluminum but oversupply was a global problem. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Dent, moderate House member, still refuses to support GOP health care bill Rep. Charlie Dent said Thursday he’s still not onboard with the GOP’s revised health care bill. The Pennsylvania Republican said on MSNBC that there are areas that need more work before he’ll be able to support the legislation, and some of the amendments added have actually taken away support from some moderates. “I suspect there will be a vote when there are enough votes to pass it,” Mr. Dent said. “This amendment hasn’t really brought in a lot of people from the center right.” SEE ALSO: Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill Mr. Dent said the focus needs to be more on the individual market and that he wanted to see more Democrats participating in drafting the legislation instead of a one party push. Mr. Dent is the leader of the moderate Tuesday Group, who went to battle with the conservative Freedom Caucus over the last Republican health bill in March.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/kansas-governor-seeks-24m-to-ban-guns-at-state-hos/
Kansas governor seeks $24M to ban guns at state hospitals TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Republican Gov. Sam Brownback proposed Thursday spending an additional $24 million over two years on armed guards and other security measures that would allow Kansas to continue banning concealed guns at state hospitals for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. The proposal immediately renewed a debate over allowing concealed weapons in public hospitals, mental health centers, state universities and colleges. A state law will require such facilities to allow concealed guns inside starting July 1 if the buildings don’t have extra security measures such as guards and metal detectors. Brownback submitted his proposal to the GOP-controlled Legislature, even though administration officials have worked with lawmakers on revising the gun-rights law. While many legislators want to change the law, gun-rights groups have strongly resisted. Brownback signed the 2013 concealed carry measure into law and is a strong gun-rights supporter. House and Senate budget committee members who reviewed the proposal criticized Brownback’s administration for submitting it only this week, with lawmakers returning Monday from a spring break to wrap up the year’s business. They doubted the state could hire all the new employees and train them before July - something an administration official confirmed - allowing guns in the meantime. “It’s pretty short-sighted to be coming to us this late in the day,” said state Rep. Erin Davis, an Olathe Republican. The gun-rights law was enacted in 2013 to ensure that gun owners could bring concealed weapons into a greater number of public buildings; Kansas later ended a requirement for a state permit to carry concealed. The law gave public hospitals, mental health centers, universities and colleges a four-year exemption, which expires July 1. State higher education officials have been preparing for the change for months, drafting new policies for dealing with guns in their buildings, and the three largest universities plan to spend more than $2 million to keep weapons out of sporting events. Some lawmakers contend the 2013 law should remain unchanged because it allows gun owners to protect themselves. Others disagree over which institutions should be allowed to continue banning guns, though support appears strongest for public hospitals, including the four state hospitals. “If they’re going to spend the money, they want to spend it on the patients,” said Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, an Overland Park Republican. The Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the state hospitals, also has discussed gun legislation with lawmakers. “It’s just that, to date, there’s been no movement,” said Cory Gwaltney, the agency’s legislative director. Brownback’s proposal includes $810,000 for metal detectors at the state’s hospitals for the mentally ill in Larned and Osawatomie and its hospitals for the developmentally disabled in Parsons and Topeka. But most of the new costs - $23.4 million over two years - would be hiring 180 new employees, including “armed personnel.” The proposal calls for the spending to start only on July 1, and Gwaltney acknowledged that the state would need three or four months to get the new workers hired. ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/donald-trump-blasts-federal-court-for-blocking-his/
President Trump blasts federal court for blocking his executive order President Trump and his top aides have lashed out at the federal court that blocked his anti-sanctuary city executive order, with the president calling the ruling “ridiculous” and his press secretary saying sanctuaries like San Francisco have “the blood of dead Americans on their hands.” Mr. Trump vowed Wednesday to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, dismissing the new ruling as the latest errant decision from the country’s most liberal judicial circuit. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick bungled federal immigration law and undercuts Americans’ faith in government. “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” Mr. Spicer said in a scorching statement. “But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the United States.” The stern reaction from the White House is all the more striking because it departs from the Justice Department, which took a more positive approach toward Judge Orrick’s decision. Department spokesman Ian D. Prior said rather than blocking Mr. Trump, the key part of Tuesday’s ruling endorsed the administration’s current approach to sanctuary cities, clearing the way for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withhold funding under three key grant programs. Judge Orrick, who sits in San Francisco, ruled that Mr. Trump overstepped his bounds by trying to impose new restrictions on federal grants issued to states, counties and cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation agents. The judge said Congress, not Mr. Trump, has the power of the purse and gets to decide what strings are attached. Judge Orrick issued an injunction against part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order threatening to withhold potentially tens of billions of dollars from sanctuary cities. But the judge said in instances where Congress has already approved strings — such as the three Justice Department programs — Mr. Trump can withhold the money. The Justice Department said those programs — the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, COPS funding and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program — were the ones they had planned to target anyway. Mr. Spicer said the judge was ignoring that federal law and the powers it granted to the administration. He also attacked Santa Clara and San Francisco, the two counties in California that had sued to halt Mr. Trump’s executive order. “San Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the well-being of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands,” Mr. Spicer said. San Francisco became the chief target in the sanctuary city debate after the 2015 slaying of Kate Steinle. The man standing trial for her killing is an illegal immigrant shielded from deportation by the city’s policies. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/dc-region-host-full-scale-counterterrorism-drill-w/
D.C. region to host ‘full-scale’ counterterrorism drill Wednesday Emergency personnel across the nation’s capital and surrounding area plan to conduct a “full-scale” counterterrorism exercise Wednesday in Maryland, Virginia and D.C. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders will participate in drills across the region Wednesday meant to prepare for the possibility of a “complex coordinated terror attack,” organizers said in a statement. “The regional exercise will be staged at six sites in the District of Columbia, suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia, and will involve hundreds of police, fire and emergency medical service personnel and volunteer actors,” said the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a nonprofit association comprised of local governments from throughout greater Washington metropolitan area. “Law enforcement officials practice and exercise their skills on their own regularly because that’s the best way to ensure we are always ready to respond quickly and professionally,” said Scott Boggs, managing director of homeland security and public safety at COG. “On April 26, we’ll go one step further and stage a very realistic emergency event involving multiple sites and actors posing as the casualties. The drill has been in the works for more than a year in the wake of terror attacks such as the 2015 assault in Paris that unfolded at multiple locations ranging from cafes and restaurants to a concert hall, Newsweek reported. “An event that has multiple locations that don’t necessarily follow jurisdictional lines poses a challenge for command and control, resourcing, things of that nature. It’s only appropriate for us to approach that regionally and ensure that we’re all prepared for and ready to manage it,” Mr. Boggs told Newsweek. “The target of the exercise is to make sure that we’re prepared. What we don’t want is the side effect of creating concern or fear because of the activities associated with the exercise,” he said. Area residents likely affected by the exercise will be warned in advance, the MWCOG said in a statement Monday, but organizers are otherwise trying to keep details about the drill under wraps. “To some degree they’re trying to make it a surprise for the participants,” MWCOG spokeswoman Jeanne Saddler told ARLnow in Arlington. “In order to maintain the exercise for participants and first responders, we have to avoid making a mention of locations.” While the organization declined to identify the specific locations involved in Wednesday’s exercise, ARLnow said members of the Arlington police SWAT team will take part in an exercise near George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. The region isn’t the only area to host counterterrorism drills as of late. About 200 emergency personnel participated in a simulated terror attack earlier this month in Jones Beach, New York, and over 80 agencies were involved in a drill in a recent Florida drill described as the largest emergency training exercise in the state’s history.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/susan-rice-political-spy-role-under-house-investig/
House intelligence panel targets Susan Rice in investigation of political spying operation Justice Department rules limit supplying politically sensitive information to the White House, a review of attorney general guidelines for domestic FBI intelligence investigations has found. A prohibition contained in the 2008 guidelines is a central focus of the ongoing House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence probe into Russian election meddling and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive U.S. intelligence communications intercepts. The prohibitions in guidelines may explain why the FBI so far has refused to cooperate with the House committee’s investigation. Specifically, as of Wednesday, the FBI still has not responded to a request for documents that could explain how the White House was able to “unmask” the names of Americans incidentally spied on during a foreign electronic intelligence operation that ran from November to January — the same months the Trump transition team was working. FBI spokesman Andrew Ames would not say why the bureau has not met the House committee’s document request. “The FBI will continue to work with our congressional oversight committees on their requests,” he told Inside the Ring. According to congressional sources, the investigation is trying to determine if Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, was involved in a clandestine political spying operation using foreign surveillance as cover. Ms. Rice is expected to be a central witness in the coming weeks before committee investigators to explain the unmasking and wide dissemination of what the committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, has called improper electronic surveillance of Trump transition team officials. Mr. Nunes has said dozens of electronic intelligence reports appear to have revealed that information on Americans was improperly and widely disseminated throughout government during the presidential transition. The attorney general guidelines for the FBI state that “compromising information concerning domestic officials or political organizations, or information concerning activities of United States persons intended to affect the political process in the United States, may be disseminated to the White House only with the approval of the attorney general.” The sharing of compromising FBI information also must be “based on a determination that such dissemination is needed for foreign intelligence purposes, for the purpose of protecting against international terrorism or other threats to the national security, or for the conduct of foreign affairs.” The acting attorney general at the time was Sally Q. Yates, and the House committee is expected to question her in addition to Ms. Rice about the FBI’s role in the intelligence-gathering controversy. The guidelines also list six categories of sensitive information that can be routinely shared with the White House. They include information on foreign spy activities in the United States, signs of an imminent foreign attack or cyberattack, data on foreign leadership changes and information about foreign economic or political events that could have an impact on national security. The FBI can also share information with the White House if the information is outlined in regularly published national intelligence requirements. The guidelines were expanded in a bid to shift the FBI’s mission from being mainly a law enforcement agency to a domestic intelligence agency with both national security and law enforcement missions. Ms. Rice has denied engaging in political spying on Donald Trump or his team and has denied leaking any classified information. However, she suggested during an MSNBC interview on April 4 that she had requested the names of Americans redacted in foreign intelligence reports. “There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to, name not provided,” Ms. Rice said. “Sometimes in that context, in order to understand the significance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to request the information as to who that person was.” The New York Times reported in March that the Obama administration officials were “scrambling” during the final days to collect and disseminate intelligence on any ties between Mr. Trump and his team and Russia, fearing that once in office the president would destroy compromising information gathered by U.S. spies. The Obama administration also loosened rules on sharing raw electronic intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency on Dec. 15 — weeks before Mr. Obama left office. A 26-page directive signed by then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper has been criticized by privacy groups as posing new risks that Americans’ rights will be violated. CHINA, RUSSIA ADVANCE HYPERSONIC WEAPONS China recently disclosed details of its high-priority program to build ultra-high-speed maneuvering missiles, as Russia is advancing its hypersonic weapons. The Chinese program, which had been shrouded in secrecy, includes a nationwide research and technology program that has achieved what experts say is rapid advancement toward fielding weapons capable of defeating strategic missile defenses. China’s disclosures were made in early March during a conference on space planes and hypersonic systems, Aviation Week reported from China. “While progress in some specific defense areas — most notably the recent flight tests of the DF-ZF/WU-14 hypersonic glide vehicles — was not discussed, the progress indicated by the underlying research makes it readily apparent that China is making strides in hypersonic capability much faster than previously thought,” the magazine reported on April 14. The Chinese for the first time showed off an image of a scramjet-powered missile that can fly at speeds of up to Mach 7 (5,370 miles per hour) and at an altitude of 18.7 miles. China’s other system is the DF-ZF, a hypersonic glider that launched on a missile and maneuvers to its target. That system has been tested six times and has raised concerns in the U.S. military. Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, Strategic Command commander, told Congress this month that China’s development of hypersonic weapons was undermining U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy. In Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on April 20 that Moscow’s high-speed arms development is comparable to those of the United States. “We have said about it before, about the fact that we are developing our own systems within the framework of the issues related not to supersonic, but to hypersonic weapons on an equal level with the United States,” Mr. Rogozin said. “However, I would not like to comment on every leak connected to some sources in the defense industry or in the defense ministry.” He was referring to reports on Moscow’s Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced April 16 that some hypersonic weapons and other advanced arms will be deployed with the Russian military by 2025. The Pentagon is developing a space plane that could be used as a hypersonic weapon. It is also researching a scramjet-powered hypersonic missile and a hypersonic attack glider. PENTAGON: RUSSIA DID NOT TARGET U.S. CRUISE MISSILES One of the questions being asked inside the Pentagon is why Russia did not attempt to shoot down U.S. cruise missiles fired during the recent Tomahawk strike on a Syrian airfield. A total of 59 Tomahawk missiles were fired on the Shayrat Air Base on April 6, the airfield used by Syrian government jets to conduct a chemical weapons attack that killed civilians. Russia has deployed S-400 and S-300 anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems at the Tartus naval supply base and the Khmeimim air base to protect its forces supporting the Bashar Assad regime. The S-400s are capable of shooting down a variety of missiles, and the Tomahawks, fired from the guided missile destroyer USS Ross from the Mediterranean, passed through the target envelope of the S-400s, according to U.S. military officials. However, officials said the Russians did not fire at the missiles and did not turn on any targeting radar used by the S-400s during the U.S. strike, something that could have revealed the system’s capabilities. Asked about the issue, Central Command spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said: “We told the Russians a short time in advance we were going to strike. What they did or didn’t do with that information — or what their range, capabilities and intent are — is something you’d have to ask them.” Russia did not say why it didn’t shoot at the Tomahawks, but Moscow complained that the attack disrupted U.S.-Russian relations. Moscow temporarily shut down a communications channel with the Pentagon used to avoid conflicts by Russian and U.S. aircraft over Syria after the strike. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/editorial-president-trumps-tax-reform/
President Trump’s tax reform ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Trump presented his eagerly anticipated tax-reform scheme Wednesday and the reviews were, as expected, mixed but hopeful. “Clearly we have a unique opportunity to do something major here,” said Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council. “It’s our intention to create a huge tax cut and equally as important, a huge simplification of the tax system in America.” The president would slash tax rates on businesses and make major changes to rates for individuals, some of them sure to raise the usual howls and squeals, but the result would be real reform of a tax system that Jimmy Carter famously called “a disgrace to the human race.” (Dogs and cats didn’t like it, either.) The reforms largely reflect the campaign promises Mr. Trump made, to wide applause, in his campaign for president. But there are stark differences. One change likely to provoke objections would repeal provisions enabling individual taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from reportable income on which they pay federal income tax. This would particularly hurt taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey. The Trump proposal would impose a top tax rate of 35 percent on individuals, down from 39.6 percent at present but more than the 33 percent he proposed on the stump. A standard deduction for everyone would be doubled, but deductions except for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, including those to religious institutions, would be eliminated. President Trump and many economists argue that tax cuts will make the economy, sluggish over the past eight years, blossom and grow, restrain deficits and restore public confidence in the government. “We’ve been hearing from the [Obama] administration that 3 percent growth is hard to get to, and they couldn’t get there,” says Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, “and that’s why we got this new president. If there had been a 3 percent growth maybe there would have been a different outcome.” But the president’s tax-cut proposal, like his proposed budget, is just that, a proposal. Presidents propose and Congress can, and usually does, dispose. Republicans generally praised the president’s proposal in the hours leading up to the president’s announcement as details began to emerge from the White House. But many congressmen in the Grand Old Party are split on the size of the tax cuts in the Grand Old Proposal, and which tax breaks, particularly for business, should stay or go away. Unless Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, and Speaker Paul Ryan in the House can keep their troops in line for whatever final reform emerges — and that’s always a big Republican “if” — the White House will need Democratic votes. Sen. Charles Schumer, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, chimed in with the expected discordant note from his place in the shade of the no-no tree, reflecting the Democratic view that Mr. Trump’s proposals are tilted heavily in favor of the prosperous. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee that will send the final proposal to Congress, sounded a more positive note. “It really makes clear the president’s commitment to tax reform and delivering it in a very bold way this year,” he says. “We’ve still got some work to do. There’s no question about it.” But tax reform is finally on the table, and that’s a start. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/amul-thapur-nomination-questioned-by-democrats-ove/
Democrats recycle Gorsuch questions for Thapur Democrats weren’t able to derail Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, but they haven’t abandoned the pointed questions they aimed at him, recycling those questions Wednesday for a hearing with appeals court nominee Judge Amul R. Thapar. From campaign finance reform cases to his ties to the conservative Federalist Society, Judge Thapar fended off the inquiries during his confirmation hearing, asking to be evaluated on the reputation he amassed during more than a decade on the federal bench. He also batted away an attempt by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, to force him into a confrontation with President Trump, whose criticism of federal courts has riled critics. “I am a proud Article III judge. We’ve been criticized from the beginning of this great country. Thomas Jefferson went after Chief Justice Marshall, and I appreciate the protection other branches provide to us,” Judge Thapal said. “It doesn’t matter to us.” Mr. Blumenthal was nonplussed. “It doesn’t matter to you, judge, but it does matter to the powers of the federal courts that the American public respect and trust the federal judiciary,” said Mr. Blumenthal. Judge Thapar is Mr. Trump’s nominee to fill an empty seat on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals — the first of what’s expected to be a series of picks to fill nearly 20 appeals court vacancies nationwide. Democrats, who lost their battle to derail Justice Gorsuch earlier this month, are trying to figure out how to handle Mr. Trump’s other court nominees. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse prodded the judge on his views about campaign finance, following a line of questioning he aimed at Justice Gorsuch. Mr. Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, wants judicial nominees to criticize the state of campaign finance law following the 2010 Citizens United case, where the Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment protected corporations’ and labor unions’ right to political speech. The senator said he rejected Judge Thapar’s past comments saying political donations are the equivalent of speech. “Those of us who are in politics know that is a false statement,” said Mr. Whitehouse. “That is indeed a preposterous statement factually because money has a completely different effect than speech once it enters the political arena.” Judge Thapar was prodded about his ruling in a case where he opposed campaign ethics rules for judicial candidates in Kentucky that would have limited their contributions in partisan politics. “This was a really hard case,” the judge said. “If the Supreme Court were to say I’m wrong, then I understand that.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced Judge Thapar, who is from his home state of Kentucky, at the hearing. Mr. McConnell noted Judge Thapar received the highest judicial qualification rating from the American Bar Association. But Democrats said they were more worried about the judge’s ties to another legal group, The Federalist Society, which is an association of conservative and libertarian-leaning legal scholars and students. The Federalist Society helped craft a list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Mr. Trump, and both Justice Gorsuch and Judge Thapar were on the list. Mr. Whitehouse accused The Federalist Society of “trying to bring its corporate interests to the court.” Judge Thapar dismissed the guilt-by-association charge, asking to be judged on his own rulings. “If you look at the entirety of my record, what you would see and what you would hear from lawyers is that I’m fair,” said Judge Thapar, quoting a criminal defense attorney who said, “I don’t know his politics, I just know he will rule by the book.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Browns make DE Myles Garrett the top pick in NFL Draft It’s official: defensive end Myles Garrett is the Cleveland Browns’ choice with the No. 1 pick. Browns General Manager Sashi Brown and Co. selected Garrett, an elite pass rusher expected to make an immediate impact on the Cleveland defense. Garrett, the former Texas A&M star, collected 31 career sacks and 141 tackles with the Aggies. Beyond his college production, Garrett became the consensus best-player-available when he ran a 4.64 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, a monstrous time given his 6-foot-4, 272-pound frame. In the months, days and even hours leading up to the draft there had been plenty of speculation that the Browns would choose a quarterback instead of Garrett. Even though Garrett is considered a generational talent, and this year’s quarterback class doesn’t contain any player viewed as a sure thing, Cleveland was reportedly enamored with former UNC passer Mitchell Trubisky. Cleveland — as of 8:14 p.m. — still controls the No. 12 pick but, with the top pick overall, they opted for the sure thing. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Bryce Harper homers in 11-run 7th, Trea Turner, Nats rout Rockies DENVER — Bryce Harper hit a three-run homer as part of an 11-run seventh inning, Trea Turner enjoyed another big game at Coors Field and the Washington Nationals routed the Colorado Rockies 16-5 on Thursday. Turner proved to be a pitcher’s nightmare throughout the four-game series. He hit for the cycle on Tuesday, finished a triple shy of another cycle Wednesday and added a double and two singles in the finale - in all, he had nine extra-base hits, scored 10 runs and had 11 RBIs. Washington finished 9-1 on its road trip, taking three of the last four at Colorado. What’s more, the Nationals scored 11 or more runs in three straight games for the first time since July 1986 at Atlanta, when the team was the Montreal Expos. Leading 4-2, the Nationals broke the game open in the seventh by sending 15 batters to the plate and pounding out eight hits, including Harper’s eighth homer. Gonzalez (3-0) scattered seven hits over 6 2/3 innings to improve to 4-0 all-time against Colorado. He also had a good day at the plate with two RBIs, including a bases-loaded walk in the big seventh. Rockies rookie Antonio Senzatela (3-1) couldn’t find his typical command in surrendering four runs over six innings. Turner, who came off the disabled list less than a week ago, made himself at home. “This ballpark, for whatever reason, feels pretty comfortable to me,” the second-year player said. “It’s fun hitting here.” His teammates felt the same way as every starter had a hit Thursday. Before the game, Rockies manager Bud Black said he was going to talk to Senzatela about not walking the pitcher, which he termed a “bad sin.” Both Tyler Chatwood and German Marquez did just that the previous two games, paving the way to costly innings. Senzatela didn’t walk the pitcher, but reliever Carlos Estevez did in the seventh. The damaging play, though, was earlier in the inning, when first baseman Mark Reynolds fielded Harper’s grounder and instead of stepping on the bag, threw home to get the runner he figured was breaking for home. Only, the runner wasn’t going and the throw wound up in the dugout. Nationals righty Stephen Strasburg was reinstated from the paternity list after the birth of his second daughter. Strasburg is scheduled to throw Saturday against the New York Mets. Rockies outfielder Gerardo Parra made a leaping catch in the sixth just before hitting the wall. Parra was shaking his right hand, but stayed in the game. Nationals infielder Ryan Zimmerman and Rockies outfielder Carlos Gonzalez didn’t start. Both had planned rest days, although manager Dusty Baker struggled with the decision with Zimmerman. “It’s hard to rest him because he’s hot,” Baker said. Rockies outfielder Charlie Blackmon had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 12 games. Third baseman Nolan Arenado hit a solo homer in the first - about the only mistake Gonzalez made all afternoon. Nationals right-hander Max Scherzer (3-1, 1.95 ERA) starts Friday when the Nationals open a three-game series against the New York Mets. Scherzer has 55 strikeouts in his last five games against the Mets, who will throw RHP Jacob deGrom (0-1). Rockies lefty Kyle Freeland (2-1, 3.32 ERA) starts Friday at Arizona. The Diamondbacks will throw LHP Robbie Ray (2-0, 3.42). Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/on-eve-of-nfl-draft-jalen-tabor-touches-base-with-/
On eve of NFL draft, Jalen Tabor touches base with D.C. roots It’s about 10 a.m. on Wednesday outside Friendship Collegiate Academy, a charter school in Northeast D.C. that Jalen Tabor used to use the buddy system to get to without getting jumped. For this particular arrival, a white Chevrolet Suburban pops a U-turn to drop him off right outside. Things are changing fast. A back door opens and out slides the 21-year-old cornerback, one red Jordan sneaker at a time. He’s wearing grey skinny jeans and a silky black bomber jacket with the punk band Sonic Youth’s “Confusion is Sex” album cover embroidered on the back. He has what looks like five pounds of gold chain jewelry around his neck and wrists. He’s days away from the NFL draft, where he is almost certain to be chosen. The door to the passenger seat swings open and, before the amount of time necessary to identify footwear passes, Merri Tabor exits the vehicle and marches past her son toward the school. She enrolled Jalen at Friendship in 2010, she arranged for him to speak to the football team today and she is in charge here. “She’s pretty much the head on the rocket and she tells me and [Jalen] what to do,” says Alex Patel, Merri’s husband and Jalen’s stepfather. Jalen was born and raised in Bowie, Md., but, after meeting Aazaar Abdul-Rahim, the Maryland defensive backs coach who was then the football coach at Friendship, Merri decided that she and Jalen would move to D.C. so that her son could play for Abdul-Rahim. She got a job transfer but her husband had to stay behind meaning that, for a time, they were paying bills in two places. “I was determined for [Jalen] to be successful,” she says. Merri was there for every breakfast and dinner and was always available to talk to Jalen’s coaches, but she couldn’t protect him from their new environment in what was one of D.C.’s most crime-ridden neighborhoods. “It was a culture shock,” Jalen says. “You go from the suburbs to the city. It taught me a lot.” After Jalen was robbed a second time, Merri made sure that older friends would make the trips to school with him. She would pick him up from practice. Jalen lost two friends in shootings, and says he learned to act calm and deferential around people he knew were carrying guns. Friendship’s football team practiced on a dirt field they dubbed ‘The Beach.’ It wasn’t a playable game field, so they played every game on the road. Old needles were a hazard. Jalen thrived anyway. He didn’t allow a completion in his direction as a junior. In 2014 as a senior, he was D.C.’s Mr. Football and the No. 4-rated cornerback prospect according to ESPN. When the colleges came calling, Jalen got offers from more than two dozen schools including Alabama, Clemson, Michigan, Ohio State, Notre Dame, LSU and Arizona. Jalen enjoys glitz, and he loved his visit to Arizona — the girls, the parties, the weather, everything just seemed better there — but Merri said no. She thought Florida, and the SEC, would provide him with a better education and a safer path to the NFL. For two weeks straight, she burst into tears telling him so every night until Jalen gave in and flipped his commitment. At Florida, Jalen broke up 33 passes in his three years, sixth-most in program history. He was first team All-SEC twice. In his last two seasons in Gainesville Jalen totaled eight interceptions and returned three of them for touchdowns, a byproduct of the instincts and vision scouts love about him. Most projections have him going in the second or third round of the draft. Jalen had been seen as a first-rounder, potentially even a top-10 pick, before he ran a 4.62 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and followed it up with an even slower time at Florida’s Pro Day — the one Bill Belichick ditched the NFL’s annual meetings to attend. Jalen says a sore hamstring impacted his times. The whole family told him not to run, but Jalen did anyway. “It’s a toss-22,” Merri said. “Do you not run and then drop to the third round? Do you run it with a bad hamstring and try?” All 32 teams have letters from Jalen’s doctor and trainer in Florida, Merri says, and they’ve been assured repeatedly that Jalen’s game film is far more important than his measurables. Jalen would love to be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, he says. He loves the Redskins but thinks they’re set at cornerback. Jalen will watch the draft from home, with his mom, stepdad, girlfriend and maybe a few friends. For a guy that doesn’t mind the spotlight, he doesn’t want to make a big deal out of the draft. This has been a taxing process. “We just try not to think about it. There’s so much scrutiny in the media these days. It’s so many negative things,” Merri says. “It’s a tough time … You’re in that balance. People don’t understand.” Paying it forward Jalen takes the stage at his old school and faces the assemblage of adolescent boys slouching in their Friendship jackets and their navy-and-gold ties, which none of them have tied correctly. They slouch because they are 16-or-so, not because they are not riveted. A few of Jalen’s many sides come through clearly as he answers their questions. He is confident: “I’m pretty sure you all know who I am,” he says after getting on stage. He goes the entire session without introducing himself by name. He has a sense of humor: “You’re gonna talk to one girl way different than you’re gonna talk to the next girl,” he says, explaining the nuances of covering shifty slot receivers versus outside burners. The teenagers laugh a little, but they mostly take this advice as Gospel. He gets ahead of himself sometimes: “I want to own a team or be a GM,” he says. Seconds before, he’d said that he hasn’t given much thought to life after his playing career. Jalen wants to be better than his idol, Deion Sanders, both as a player and as a showman. He jumps from topic to topic, smiling widely and speaking freely. This is not out of character. While at Florida, Jalen commented on topics ranging from displeasure with the Florida athletic department to the police shooting death of Alton Sterling on his Twitter account. He is outspoken, and thinks athletes have an obligation to be that way. “We’ve got to do a better job of speaking out for what’s right and not being quiet because we’re getting paid a lot of money to be quiet,” he says. An African-American studies major who plans on finishing his degree the summer after his rookie NFL season, Jalen says he never felt the direct impact of racism as a player at Florida, but noticed its effect on the community around him. “They shelter us because we’re making money for them,” he says. He mentions that Gainesville is not far from the prison in Raiford, where the state’s death row inmates are housed. While at Florida, Jalen gradually realized that most of the faces he saw on local news coverage had skin shaded like his. He’s not sure what he would do if he were forced to choose between an NFL contract and the freedom to speak his mind, but he has a plan in place to avoid facing that choice. “I’m going to play so well and I’m going to be such a good person that they’re not going to be able to get me out of there,” he says. Jalen wants to control his own image, and he is already good at marketing himself. When he did not go to SEC Media Day in 2016, he held his own via Periscope. He declared for the draft in January and announced his decision in a goodbye letter to Florida published in the Players’ Tribune. He admires the Ball brothers, Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo, whose father LaVar has made headlines this year for, among other things, a war of words with Nike. LaVar Ball issued a public warning that BBB, the apparel brand he created in his kids’ honor, will one day eat into the marketplace that Nike, Adidas and Under Armour currently dominate. “I think that’s amazing,” Tabor says. “I feel like that’s what I want to do, have my own cleat one day and stuff like that. Your own brand? That’s what’s best. You don’t want to be a part of somebody else’s brand.” Insider and outsiders There’s a man in a black shirt, black pants and a black hat with a green gator on the cap hanging out by the door of the auditorium. That’s Ty. Midway through last season, Merri decided it was worthwhile to have someone with Jalen 24-7. “People think I’m crazy,” she says. That includes Jalen, who sometimes doesn’t like having Ty, a family friend, come with him every time he goes out. “Just protecting his best interest,” Merri says. “You hear about all of these bad stories coming up this week, and it’s really bad this year. Kids getting into a fight at a bar, that was actually his teammate [Caleb Brantley], another kid who did something in a hotel room.” “If you have that, someone there that’s looking out for you, those things either won’t occur or they’re consciously thinking ‘Let’s go. You can’t hit her back,’ or ‘You’ve gotta go.’ You know what I mean? ‘You can’t be doing this.’ And that’s important. People don’t realize that that’s very, very important. It may seem like babysitting but hey,” she says. Ty is not here because Merri doesn’t think Jalen knows right from wrong. She is sure he does, because she made sure during those days when it was just the two of them living down the street from Friendship on South Dakota Avenue. Jalen’s days of football practice and class were followed up by life lessons with Merri. A sample of her curriculum: “Women 101, Guns 101, Drugs 101,” she says. “We’d sit down and I’d say, ‘Can you carry this pill without this prescription cup?’ People don’t know that,” Merri says. “If you put, let’s just say Oxycodone or Tylenol 3, because sometimes he would take Tylenol for his body, can you carry that around without the prescription bottle?” “Well of course he said yes, because he didn’t know, but you can’t, that’s illegal. Just little stuff like that,” she says. How to handle money was a major topic before Jalen went to college. It will become one again once he signs his first NFL contract. They’ve already had conversations about saving for the future and about how a second contract isn’t guaranteed but they haven’t “in-depthed it” yet, Merri says. Money is also a major reason Jalen’s family thinks having Ty around is a good idea. The months leading up to the draft are full of outsiders looking for an in with a soon-to-be millionaire. “He’s got a big heart, he can’t say no, and we can’t be there,” Patel says. Jalen does have a history of getting into trouble, though nothing that would give an NFL team major pause. Tabor was cited for marijuana possession once and suspended twice, once for reportedly refusing to take a drug test and a second time for fighting with teammate C’yontai Lewis in practice. He missed both the 2015 and 2016 season openers as a result. With every incident, he’s had to place a call home to Merri. “I didn’t want to, but I had to,” Jalen says. Asked what words were typically exchanged on those calls, Jalen exhales sharply. His eyes widen and he shakes his head. “A whole bunch of stuff,” is all he says. A call with bad news, though, is better than no call at all. “I’d rather him call me and we put out the fire than him be scared and me get nervous,” Merri says. “I’ve never been nervous any time I’ve gotten a phone call because that just makes kids say, ‘Oh, I’m not calling her.’ You know? And so I’d rather have that.” Jalen said there was a time when he didn’t have to call, though, that proved to be a pivotal moment. He hadn’t stopped smoking after his marijuana citation and, one day, while gassing up his car, police officers showed up. He saw them coming and quickly stuffed the little bag of contraband he had on him into the gas compartment. The officers searched his vehicle thoroughly, dumping out the bag of chips and can of soda he had in the front seat. But they never checked the gas compartment. Jalen said thinking about what might have happened after his second offense scared him straight. “I just [saw] all the plays in college flash before my eyes,” he says. One more lesson Jalen takes pictures, signs autographs and passes out Florida Gators wristbands with the gaggle of students who stayed behind after he finished speaking. Soon the group is told to get to class, and to walk quietly on their way there. Jalen asks about an old teacher. “She still up on the third floor?” Jalen’s hope is to start a charter school in D.C., just like Friendship, once his NFL earnings start coming in. He and Merri have prepared a patent application for the name New Foundations D.C., which is what they want to call the school. “If I can give these kids a little bit of light to help their situation that means the world to me,” Jalen says. In Merri’s mind, she sees Jalen walking the halls of New Foundations waving to students, or heading out to watch football practice. She of all people understands that her son would not be where he is without the help of others, and it’s important to her that he pays it forward. The school has a secondary purpose, too. It’s a constructive project, something Jalen can focus on in the limited time he has that isn’t consumed by football, and a reminder that he doesn’t play in the pursuit of luxury alone. “Keeping his mind straight and making sure that he remembers that there’s more to life than just football, there’s more to life than just the glamour,” she said. “Let’s keep concentration on where we came from, make sure we’re able to give back, stay focused. You’re on a platform. Everybody is watching and you’ve got to remember that because they look up to you.” As she talks, her language morphs. At first she is describing what she wants for her son. But gradually, it becomes clear she is still speaking directly to Jalen — a mom trying to squeeze in one last life lesson before the pros call. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Reports: Redskins, right tackle Morgan Moses agree to 5-year extension The Redskins signed right tackle Morgan Moses to a 5-year extension, according to multiple reports. The extension would make Moses the second-highest paid right tackle in the league, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. That could vault Moses into the $10 million per year range. Moses, a third-round pick of the Redskins in 2014, developed into a player who started every game over the last two season as Washington’s offense flourished. He would have reached free agency in 2018 and commanded big money on the open market, particularly as he has the ability to play on the left as well as the right. Moses played some left tackle in 2014, his first year in the NFL. As a mid-round pick who was considered a developmental prospect, Moses‘ Draft Day extension serves as a reminder of what solid drafting can do for a team. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/scott-brooks-john-wall-made-small-changes-had-big-/
Two small changes had a big impact for Wizards Paul Millsap maneuvered around and into Markieff Morris with precision, sending the Wizards’ power forward to the bench with foul trouble game after game. Something had to be done. It wasn’t just the fouls. Millsap was scoring from the field with efficiency. He picked up assists. Washington knew that the Hawks’ All-Star would be a problem in its first-round playoff series with Atlanta. But, it also believed that Morris — 6-foot-10, mobile, feisty — was a well-constructed counter to the man who gave the Wizards so much trouble two years ago in the playoffs. For three of the first four games, Washington was wrong. Which is why it changed Wednesday in Game 5. The first time Washington sent a double-team toward Millsap, John Wall came from the baseline in the first quarter and stole the ball. That change by Wizards coach Scott Brooks and a subtle offensive one by Wall helped tilt that game and the series into Washington’s favor. It leads the best-of-seven first-round series 3-2. Game 6 is Friday in Atlanta. Morris’ series-long tussle with Millsap has included suggestions that one player is too rough. That came from Millsap, who groaned after Game 1 that Washington was “playing MMA.” Morris began taking verbal shots at Millsap before the series began. He told reporters not to call him a “stretch-four” because it insinuated, in his mind, that a player was soft. He followed-up by saying the title was fine for Millsap. After Morris controlled the matchup in the opening game, Millsap began to dominate. Morris played 38 minutes in Game 1. He’s averaged 23 minutes per game since because of perpetual foul trouble. Taking Morris off the floor forced Brooks to apply even worse matchups against Millsap. Backup big man Jason Smith, who will be a gametime decision Friday because of a bruised left calf, has guarded him. Bojan Bogdanovic, know as a shooter and not a defender, has dealt with Millsap. The best counter to Millsap in the series has often been center Marcin Gortat. His length is able to make up ground against Atlanta’s whirling power forward. But, Washington wants Morris on the floor as often as possible. Which is why Brooks broke from his season-long preference not to double team any opposing player, even one who was starting possessions at the mid-post, making him ripe for an occasional trap. “We wanted to try to save Keef from getting in foul trouble – I don’t know if that strategy worked,” Brooks said with a smile. “[We] might have to go back and try something else. I thought it did work a few possessions. It’s something that we talked about and worked on and I give our guys a lot of credit, they executed it [and] it took them a little bit out of their rhythm. [Paul] Millsap is a handful – he’s so crafty [and] he gets our guys in foul trouble. We have to somehow counter.” Morris made it through the first quarter with zero fouls. By halftime, he had three. A fourth came in the third quarter. His fifth was dubious, came with 3:19 to play and not because of Millsap, though it was committed against him. Morris dove onto the floor for a loose ball. Millsap tumbled over him. Morris’ grumbling about the call earned him a technical foul. Morris turned to jokes about the strategy after Washington won Game 5. “Obviously it was to protect me to be on the court, but that didn’t work,” Morris said. “So, I guess we need another adjustment.” Surely, he, Smith and Gortat have discussed Millsap’s tendencies and how to guard him, right? “Don’t foul him,” Morris said. “That’s not working so we have to figure something else out.” Wall had to make an adjustment, too. Massive Dwight Howard had taken away one of Wall’s relied-upon mechanisms: the pocket pass to Gortat. Wall and Gortat formed one of the league’s most potent pick-and-roll duos during this season and prior ones. The majority of Gortat’s scoring was a result of his understanding of where and when to roll, plus Wall’s on-point passing when reading the situation. Howard has snuffed that out. So, Wall began to shoot from about eight feet in Game 5, using a little push shot off two feet that he terms a floater. It’s an angle and release he uses sparingly. But, Howard’s defense forced him into it. “[Howard] plays in-between me passing the ball and taking away jump shots,” Wall said. “Especially with [Kent] Bazemore and those guys on me — the bigger defenders — they do a great job of contesting late, so I try to get a little deeper and shoot floaters. I had some good looks. Some of them rimmed in and out. Some hit the back of the rim. But I think some gave ourselves to take a better shot than force turnovers at times.” Brooks knew they had to handle Millsap differently. Wall knew the lane was clogged in a way he was unaccustomed to. With two changes, they found improvements in each spot. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/karl-alzner-miss-game-1-against-penguins/
Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner to miss Game 1 against Penguins Capitals coach Barry Trotz didn’t even wait for the question about Karl Alzner’s health to be asked. “Same lineup as Game 6 against Toronto,” Trotz said. “There’s your one question.” Alzner (upper body) is out Thursday in Game 1 against the Pittsburgh Penguins as the Capitals defenseman is set to miss his fifth straight game. Trotz said Alzner is still “day-to-day and progressing,” but added Alzner needed medical clearance before he returns to game action. “Yeah, we’re not going to put him at risk,” Trotz said. Alzner, though, has participated in practice since Friday. He has had more of a workload each practice and has taken contact drills. “I feel good. I’m progressing,” Alzner said Tuesday. Alzer played the first two games in Round 1 against Toronto, but has been out with an upper body injury since. The Capitals replaced Alzner in the lineup with defenseman Nate Schmidt, who has created the desired impact on the defense. “Schmidty has played unbelievable,” Alzner said. “You can really see what he brings to the table when he’s on the ice with speed and creating the way he does. The PK did good. And yeah, there’s no complaints. “It’s hard watching games, and you feel really bad about it, but the team played awesome and didn’t give me too much to worry about.” When Alzner returns remains unclear.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/rickey-jean-francois-redskins-cousins-mccloughan/
LOVERRO: Ricky Jean Francois on Redskins, Cousins, McCloughan ANALYSIS/OPINION: Of course the Washington Redskins would still use Scot McCloughan’s player evaluations as part of their draft strategy. Why wouldn’t they? He is very good at evaluating players — like when he drafted Ricky Jean Francois in the seventh round of the 2009 draft for the San Francisco 49ers, and then, two years ago, shortly after taking the job as the Redskins general manager, signed him as a free agent for Washington. So, like many in the football business — and like a lot of Redskins fans — Francois was stunned when Washington, for reasons that had nothing to do with his ability to judge talent, fired McCloughan. “I was shocked,” Francois said in an interview on my podcast “Cigars & Curveballs,” available on iTunes, Google Play, the reVolver podcast network and The Washington Times web site. AUDIO: NFL defensive lineman Ricky Jean-Francois with Thom Loverro “For a guy who so many different franchises has spoke so highly of — the Redskins released him, I was shocked … everybody spoke highly of him. Nobody said anything negative about him.” Well, nobody except the Redskins. A few days after McCloughan was fired, so was Francois — released by the Redskins. With the departure of free agent Chris Baker to Tampa Bay, Washington lost its top two defensive linemen this winter. His release also came after Francois had publicly questioned some Redskins Park business in an interview on SB Nation Radio. “It seems like we’re getting back to the norm … dysfunctional, we’re getting back to the drama,” Jean-Francois said. “It just feels like … we’ve never had that period where we were just comfortable with everything and everything was just running smooth,” he said. “Everything is changed and it’s like, why? We let go of DeSean Jackson, one of the most explosive receivers in the NFL. We let go of Pierre Garςon — only had one drop last year. You let Chris Baker go, Chris Baker was one great pass rusher for us. “At the end of the day, it’s business,” Francois said. “But it’s not the business that you want to see each and every other day at work when everything is going hectic and you just don’t know what’s going on, who’s making calls. Who’s what. “It’s like as soon as you open the front of the newspaper you just see drama.” A few days later, Francois was no longer a Washington Redskin. To his credit, in his first interview with Washington media since he was released, Francois refused to directly attribute his release to his public criticism of the team. “I don’t know,” he said, when asked if he thought he was let go because of his public criticism. “At the end of the day, I don’t take stuff personally. It’s football. It’s a business. Don’t let your feelings get into it or try to figure out what happened. “When they released me, it was my time to go,” Francois said. “It was my time to take that next step. When I got the phone call from different teams, I didn’t feel bad, because I was getting phone calls from Super Bowl contenders each and every year. I wasn’t mad. It was just my time to move on. I wasn’t shocked.” Perhaps his next stop eased the shock — signing a one-year, $3 million deal with one of the NFL gold standard franchises, the Green Bay Packers — a franchise that appears to operate 180 degrees opposite of the Redskins. “The Seattle Seahawks, I took a visit there,” the 30-year-old Francois said. “I took a visit to Chicago too. There were other teams interested, but it came down to Seattle and Green Bay. I talked about it with my wife and we decided to take a shot at Green Bay. They are not big going after free agents, and them allowing me to be part of the franchise and take another shot at the Super Bowl, I am blessed to have the opportunity to suit up in that Green Bay Packers uniform. “I am excited to be part of the Green Bay Packers history, from Vince Lombardi to Bart Starr to Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers to just so many guys, Reggie White,” Francois said. “When I got a chance to visit there, the history just took me in. I never knew the community owned the team. They have always been held to a high standard. It’s a blessing to be part of a franchise with such a rich history.” Ironically, it was the Green Bay Packers where McCloughan got his start as a scout. “If he wants to come back to the Green Bay Packers, I am ready for him to take that step,” Francois said. “He’s a great GM.” After facing Aaron Rodgers a number of times over his career — including with the Redskins in the playoffs two years ago. But he thinks that the Redskins have that sort of elite quarterback — Kirk Cousins. One of Francois‘ criticisms in his radio interview was the team’s failure to sign Cousins to a long-term contract. He hasn’t backed off that criticism. “He (Cousins) broke nearly every Redskins record,” Francois said. “He put us in positions to win. He helped those guys be great. A quarterback can help receivers get from good to great and be their best, and I think Kirk Cousins did that. “He hasn’t even hit his ceiling yet,” Francois said. “He’s not that Peyton Manning or that Tom Brady yet, but when he gets to that point, he’s going to be one of the scariest quarterbacks in the NFL. Look at his numbers. Tell me what he has not done yet. To do it in back-to-back seasons, that’s enough said. I respect him so much, he worked on the field, first man in, last man out, he was going to show you he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league.” If Cousins does get to that point — a Manning or a Brady — he, like Francois, may wind up doing it someplace else. The NFL, like Francois said, is a business. But some are better at that business than others. ⦁ Thom Loverro hosts his weekly podcast “Cigars & Curveballs” Wednesdays available on iTunes, Google Play and the reVolver podcast network.

Report: McCloughan serving as draft advisor to multiple teams After the Washington Redskins fired former general manager Scot McCloughan in March, team President Bruce Allen said that he hoped McCloughan would find work again, even before this year’s draft. Looks like McCloughan has done just that. According to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, McCloughan has advised multiple NFL teams through their draft processes since his dismissal from Redskins Park. “He [McCloughan] had a scouting service before he became the general manager of the Redskins and according to sources he is back running that scouting service and has advised NFL teams on his thoughts on the draft prospects eligible for the draft this year,” Garofolo reported on NFL Network Thursday afternoon. Garafolo went on to clarify that McCloughan is not giving out Redskins information, just offering his own evaluations of prospects. On Monday, Redskins scouting director Scott Campbell said McCloughan’s influence was still evident on the team’s draft board. The Redskins front office began creating the board months before McCloughan was fired. “Certainly his influence is there from the initial boards,” Campbell said. McCloughan has an excellent reputation as a scout so, while he will likely struggle to find another job with a title like GM, it’s not surprising that teams are interested in his evaluations.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/snyder-struggling-put-away-hawks-not-good-omen/
SNYDER: Struggle to oust Hawks is not a good omen Maybe it’s just me, but I thought this Washington Wizards squad was better than the playoff version two and three seasons ago. I thought the current edition was superior with a wiser John Wall and sturdier Bradley Beal. The starting lineup was more balanced with a versatile Markieff Morris and improved Otto Porter. The reserves had more firepower with a streaky Bojan Bogdanovic and feisty Kelly Oubre. And the team updated to a 21st century approach with scrappy Scott Brooks in the first seat on the bench. So why is this series against Atlanta so darn hard? Game 5 on Wednesday wasn’t decided until Wall’s jumper created the final margin,103-99, with 47 seconds left. All that remained was surviving another drive by Paul Millsap, who was challenged by Gortat and thudded to the floor without getting a whistle. The Hawks’ All-Star forward, who also was rejected in the paint by Beal with 1:36 left, complained bitterly after the buzzer, following a referee to half court. Then Millsap turned and sulked off the court with his teammates, losers for the third time in three games this series at Verizon Center. This was the closest contest yet, the four-point victory preceded by an eight-point edge in Game 2 and a seven-point margin in Game 1. The Wizards haven’t had a breather at home and definitely not away. They were whipped by 18 in Game 3 before suffering a more-respectable 10-point defeat in Game 4. “All three games here we’ve given ourselves a chance,” Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We feel like we can play better.” The Wizards can say the same thing, but they certainly played better defense Wednesday, blocking 10 shots, recording eight steals and holding Atlanta to 40.9 percent shooting from the field. Credit a defense-focused film study that Brooks said was “pretty direct and honest.” Beal put it this way: “He basically told everyone whether or not they can guard and said he won’t play you if you can’t guard. It was something we needed because our defense slacked in Atlanta.” For all the goodwill and happy feelings the Wizards engendered with a 49-win campaign, none have carried over to the postseason. Based on their play for most of the season, Game 5 should’ve been the finale, not the set-up for Atlanta’s win-or-stay-home scenario. The 2014-15 Wizards weren’t nearly as impressive, yet they swept Toronto in the first round. In 2013-2014, Washington was still more joke than threat. But Randy Wittman coached ‘em up for a five-game, first-round upset against Chicago. Now, as a trendy pick to reach the Eastern Conference finals, the Wizards are struggling to merely advance? It doesn’t make sense. Fortunately, they don’t have to win a single game in Atlanta if they remain undefeated in DC. However, extending a series creates opportunities for misfortune, like the bruised calf forward Jason Smith suffered. Extending a series adds wear and tear to Wall and Beal, who logged 39 and 41 minutes, respectively. Extending a series gives the underdog hope and belief, attributes already bubbling in the Hawks. At least the Wizards aren’t headed south in a must-win situation. Wall prevented that from happening with 20 points and 14 assists. The bench showed up with 14 points from Bogdanovic and five each from Oubre and Smith. We finally saw a semblance of the balanced attack that had been AWOL. Porter had 17 points to make it four Wizards in total with double-figure scoring. “Just trying to be aggressive,” he said after hitting 9-of-10 free throws. Aggression has been a buzzword this series. Each team believes whoever come out ahead on that front will leave the court with a victory. “For more of the 48 minutes we have to be more focused,” Budenholzer said. “We have to be the aggressor, take care of the ball and get good possessions. We have to go stronger to the basket. We’ll go back to Atlanta and we have to be aggressor and make plays.” Washington can’t hardly afford a repeat performance of last week’s trip. Playing a Game 7 at home is nice, but it doesn’t compare to resting and preparing for the next round. Friday would be a swell time for the Wizard’ best game of the series and a laugher opposed to a nail-biter. “They’re gong play all out and give everything they have,” Wall said. “This is really the first time we’ve had a close-out game on the road. It’s a great task for us.” It wasn’t supposed to be this hard, at least not yet. The real challenge was supposed to await against Boston and then, presumably, Cleveland. If these Wizards really are the franchise’s best team in 38 years, it’s time for them to prove it. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/wizards-top-hawks-game-5-103-99-grab-3-2-series/
Wizards top Hawks 103-99, grab 3-2 series lead Brandon Jennings wagged his left index finger and mouthed, “One more, one more” as he walked to the locker room. Jennings was using his right hand to slap hands with joyous fans while delivering his decree. One more. That’s all that remains for Washington now. Wednesday night’s 103-99 Wizards win was more survival than controlled result. It will not be remembered for grace or ease. But, it will be the win noted for putting Washington ahead 3-2 against the Atlanta Hawks in its first-round playoffs series. Two chances to advance are on the horizon. Game 6 is in Atlanta — where Washington is yet to win in this series — on Friday night. If Game 7 is necessary, it will be back in Verizon Center on Sunday. Tension brewed with 2:49 to play. Markieff Morris’ fifth foul led to an argument that led to a technical foul. The made free throw was followed by a Wizards miss and a Hawks dunk. Washington’s lead was a meager two points. Washington coach Scott Brooks called timeout. Much like the series, play swung evenly from there until John Wall’s jump shot. With just 47 seconds to play, the night’s scoring had finished. Wall’s long isolation jump shot went in and a careening end began. Marcin Gortat stifled Paul Millsap’s drive. Wall missed. Gortat pulled in the offensive rebound, looked around and discovered himself open with 12 seconds to play. He decided to shoot instead of hold the ball or pass it. He missed. “He’ll make that every night of the year other than tonight,” Brooks said. But, the clock offered Atlanta few options. Tim Hardaway Jr. missed a 3-pointer. The horn went off, the home team was relieved. Bradley Beal scores 27 points. Wall finished with 20 points and 14 assists. That duo also received some help. Otto Porter scored 17 points and Bojan Bogdanovic provided 14 off the bench. “We made a few more winning basketball plays,” Brooks said. “We made a few more shots.” Washington had cured so many maladies by the end of the third quarter. It led points in the paint, 30-28, after being crushed in that area the first four games of the series. It was almost level in rebounds after being clobbered there for the opening quarter-plus Wednesday. It had turned the ball over just five times. It was plus-8 in fast-break points. And yet, it led by only four points at the end of the third. Atlanta absorbed a third-quarter blow which put it behind by 11 points, then rallied to tie the game two minutes after run-stopping timeout. Throughout the night, containing Hawks point guard Dennis Schroder continued to be a problem. The darting, German-born 23-year-old made all four of his 3-pointers in the first half and five on the night. His 16 points carried the Hawks through a first half in which they shot just 41.3 percent. He prefers trash-talking and flair — he arrived Wednesday with metallic silver shoes on — to a stoic approach. With the lights brightest in the playoffs, Schroder has tormented Washington. He finished with 29 points. Washington used a wrinkle and watched a norm in the first half. It flashed a trap at Hawks menace Millsap, who had spent the first four games dicing up Markieff Morris on isolations. The new tactic worked: It created a turnover. Brooks had been loathe to double-team any player during the regular season. He said before the game Washington had some defensive changes in mind. That was one. But Morris was not able to stay out of his standard foul trouble. By the half he again had three fouls and claimed a fourth less than three minutes into the third quarter. The Wizards used him often at the start of the game to attack Millsap. Morris scored eight points against Millsap, leaving him just a point shy of his totals from Game 3 and 4, respectively. Millsap also left the half early because he committed three fouls. He was not called for another. Washington held a one-point lead once the grinder of a half ended. Atlanta led by seven at one point; Washington by five. Both knew whomever failed in the second half would be facing elimination 48 hours later. It turns out that’s the issue now facing Atlanta, as Jennings was more than happy to note. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/27/nationals-beat-rockies-11-4-behind-near-cycle-from/
Nationals beat Rockies behind near cycle from Trea Turner DENVER - Good luck navigating through the top five of Washington’s lineup these days. It’s definitely a pick-your-poison sort of situation. Trea Turner nearly hit for the cycle for a second straight night, finishing a triple shy, and Bryce Harper had four more hits to run his average to .432 as the Nationals beat the Colorado Rockies 11-4 on Wednesday. In all, the combination of Adam Eaton, Turner, Harper, Ryan Zimmerman and Daniel Murphy went 13 of 24 with three homers and all 11 RBIs to help the Nationals improve to 8-1 on their 10-game trip. Now that’s production. “We have power and most of them are swinging pretty good right now,” Nationals manager Dusty Baker said. “We get greedy. We smell kind of blood in the water and they jump on it. This is what we preach all the time.” Tanner Roark (3-0) worked his way out of several jams to throw five solid innings. He allowed two runs and struck out four. Never quite settling in on a cool night, Tyler Chatwood (2-3) surrendered five runs in five innings. “My misses are bad right now,” Chatwood said. “That’s the big thing that’s hurting me.” Turner followed his cycle the night before with a solo shot in the fifth, a single in the seventh and a double in the eighth. He didn’t get up again in the game to try for the triple. “He’s going to have a lot of cycles in his career. That’s just who he is and type of player he is,” Harper said. “He has a good chance to do that on any given night. If he played here, he’d probably do it a lot more.” Zimmerman had a two-run shot in the fifth and Murphy added a three-run homer in the seventh that turned the game into a rout. Harper kept up his torrid pace at the plate with four hard hits, including a double. It was his third four-hit game this season. “As you know, their top five guys, right now, presently, are swinging it,” said Rockies manager Bud Black, whose team committed a season-high three errors. “Very, very formidable.” Roark ran into trouble in the fifth when the Rockies loaded the bases. He walked DJ LeMahieu to force in a run and gave up another run on Nolan Arenado’s fielder’s choice. With two outs and two on, Roark struck out Carlos Gonzalez with a 77-mph curve. Gonzalez broke his bat on the ground in frustration. For the second straight night, a two-out walk in the second inning to the pitcher came back to haunt the Rockies. After Chatwood missed on a 3-2 fastball to Roark, Eaton followed with a two-run single. “That’s embarrassing,” Chatwood said of walking Roark after an 0-2 count. On Tuesday, German Marquez issued a two-out walk that turned into a five-run frame in a game the Nationals won 15-12. They have taken two of three in the four-game series with Colorado. TRAINER’S ROOM Nationals: Reliever Koda Glover was placed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement. He’s 0-1 with two saves in 11 relief appearances. … The Nationals recalled LHP Matt Grace from Triple-A Syracuse to step in for Glover. Rockies: OF David Dahl (ribs) will take batting practice in the next day or two. He’s hoping to get in some at-bats during extended spring training in Arizona next week. “I feel good,” Dahl said. “Really good. No problems.” Umpires: Home plate umpire Marty Foster took a foul tip off the mask in the third and was checked on by Colorado’s trainer along with crew chief Mike Winters. Foster stayed in the game. MILESTONES Rockies OF Charlie Blackmon extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the third. … Gonzalez became the sixth player to suit up in 1,000 games for the Rockies. … Roark surpassed the 600 career innings mark Wednesday. DUNN OUT The Rockies will be without one of their most reliable relievers after LHP Mike Dunn went on the 10-day disabled list due to back spasms. Dunn is 2-0 with a 1.17 ERA in 10 appearances. To take his place, the Rockies reinstated RHP Chad Qualls (forearm tightness) from the DL. UP NEXT Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (2-0, 1.35) will throw Thursday. The Rockies counter with RHP Antonio Senzatela (3-0, 2.08), who’s 2-0 with a 1.93 ERA at Coors Field this season. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/lars-ellers-boost-to-the-third-line-will-matter-ag/
Lars Eller’s boost to the third line will matter against Penguins Center Lars Eller knows what happened to the Washington Capitals in last year’s playoff matchup against the Pittsburgh Penguins. He knows this series, against this opponent, is a big part of the reason the Capitals made the trade to bring him to Washington from the Montreal Canadiens. Eller recalled Capitals coach Barry Trotz telling him the strength of Washington’s third line was “something they were missing” when the Capitals lost in six games to the Penguins in 2016. The Capitals‘ season ended on May 10 and on June 24, Washington gave up two draft picks for Eller. Now, Eller and the third line will get a chance to prove their worth when the Capitals get another shot at the Penguins in the second round. Game 1 is Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the Verizon Center. “If you look at the last couple of [Stanley] Cup winners, they always have big goals from their third or fourth line in big games,” Eller said. “A lot of the times, that’s what can tilt a game in your favor and eventually the series. It’s important.” Eller was in his car when he got the call from Canadiens general manager Marc Berwin. The trade took Eller by surprise, considering he had been with the Canadiens for six seasons. He had to adjust to a new city and a new scheme. But during the regular season, the Capitals saw the impact they’d hoped for when they acquired the 27-year-old native of Denmark. When Eller was on the ice with Andre Burakovsky and Brett Connolly, the Capitals scored 16 goals while only allowing six. The Eller-Burakovsky-Connolly trio was also one of the most productive units in puck possession in the entire NHL. The group was fifth among lines that played at least 200 minutes in percentage of shot attempt differential, meaning the Capitals took 58.57 percent of the shot attempts when they were on the ice. Eller said the line found its rhythm around late December and early January. Trotz credited the line’s improvement once they upgraded Eller from Mike Richards, one of last year’s centers on the third line. Jay Beagle filled the spot as well. “Lars, he’s a big-frame guy, he can play against big centermen, he can play against quick centermen,” Trotz said. “He’s been fairly productive. … Nothing against Richie who was fabulous for us last year, but we didn’t get much offense out of that position last year.” In the playoffs, the third line hasn’t been as productive, forcing Trotz to make changes. In Game 4 against Toronto, forward Tom Wilson replaced Connolly on the line. In the games since, Connolly’s minutes have dropped and he has only seen an average of 5:24 in ice time since the change. Eller and Burakovsky have yet to score a goal in the playoffs, while Wilson has three goals. “We’ll need some more offense out of that group going forward, but we got offense all through every line,” Trotz said. The Penguins‘ roster is largely the same since the last playoff matchup. while the Capitals added free agent Connolly and traded for Eller and defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, who was acquired to boost the third defensive pairing and bring an offensive threat to the power play. Connolly said his limited minutes have made it hard to have an impact in the playoffs, but he knows the importance of the third and fourth lines. “Me and Lars were brought in here to eat up some minutes and create some offense in the bottom six. I think we did that in the regular season,” Connolly said. “This is going to be a big series. … We’re going to have to be good. They have two bottom six lines that can play.” The units have done the job to help get the Capitals this far, but how much of an impact they will have against the defending Stanley Cup champions — and if they can get past them — remains to be seen. “I can’t wait for that challenge,” Eller said. “I think a lot of guys in here have pictured that this is a spot we could end up being in — facing [the Penguins] sometime in the playoffs and now is that time. We’re just thrilled to have that opportunity.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/snyder-instant-nfl-draft-grades-fun-meaningless/
SNYDER: Instant NFL draft grades fun but meaningless ANALYSIS/OPINION Numerous common sayings that have been around forever are flat-out wrong. For instance, “time heals all wounds.” That’s only true in certain cases when time includes death. Because we know some folks never get over the hurt of old grievances and failed relationships, carrying that pain to the grave. Washington’s team is on the clock entering the 2017 NFL draft, the first since supposed savior Scot McCloughan was fired as general manager. McCloughan’s two-year stint spawned a phrase that grew in popularity as the team grew in credibility: “In Scot we trust.” But that idiom turned out to be idiotic, like the one that declares words can never hurt you, only sticks and stones. Putting faith in McCloughan meant putting belief in team owner Dan Snyder and team president Bruce Allen. Shame on us for doing so; the dud of a duo had fooled us way more than twice before McCloughan arrived. Maybe we’re among the segment of people that can be snookered all the time. Nevertheless, the NFL draft always brings renewed hope, a sense of excitement triggered by the unknown. Never mind that plenty of gems can be found on the streets after the draft ends Saturday. One of the league’s all-time most notable undrafted players, Tony Romo, just entered the broadcast booth. Other stars deemed unfit for a pick still enjoyed NFL success, including Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, nine-time Pro Bowler Jason Peters and future Hall-of-Famer Antonio Gates. Washington in recent years has uncovered a couple of undrafted nuggets in middle linebacker Will Compton, whose 60 tackles last season tied for second-most on the team, and halfback Robert Kelley, whose average gain per carry (4.2 yards) was equal to Arizona’s David Johnson, the league’s seventh-leading rusher. Picking through the discard bin is great, like going on a scavenger hunt. Hitting a few surprises can impact the bottom line more than late-round finds, which are the equivalent of thrift shopping. Your team can brag forever if it rolls a Dak Prescott in the fourth or hits the Powerball on a Tom Brady in the sixth. Washington fans had reason to expect such success with McCloughan in the fold. But the short-lived era will go down as a blip on the franchise’s troubled journey since Snyder assumed ownership in 1999. Allen came aboard in 2010, and the public’s “no confidence” votes are only mounting. The good news, though, is wins and losses are subjective on draft day. Much will be made of which player goes to Cleveland at No. 1 and who Allen and Co. take at No. 17 — assuming trades don’t make a mockery of the mocks. Every team’s haul will be analyzed and given a grade. But the truth is, final scores are often a few years down the road, sometimes after players reach their third or fifth team. You never would guess this, but Washington wasn’t half-bad in recent drafts before McCloughan. According to an article in The Washington Post and a formula created by Pro Football Reference, the franchise’s last five drafts have outperformed expectations. The assessment is based on the Approximate Value players should deliver, from the No. 1 overall pick all the way down to Mr. Irrelevant at draft’s end. McCloughan’s class last year included first-round pick Josh Doctson, who played only two games. The rookies under-performed as a whole (-5.7 in AV), but each of the prior four classes posted positive numbers: +5.2 in 2015; +6 in 2014; +5.3 in 2013; and +29.4 in 2012. Washington’s director of college scouting, Scott Campbell, has run things in Ashburn for the last several weeks. Selections will be the culmination of group discussions that created the draft board. Allen gets the final say on trades (and probably everything else when he sees fit). Like Allen, Campbell is a longtime football man and son of a former NFL coach. I guess we shouldn’t hold the lengthy tenure with Washington — 17 years over two stints — against him. Six of Campbell’s seven first-round picks since 2006 were Pro Bowlers (Brandon Scherff, Robert Griffin III, Ryan Kerrigan, Trent Williams, Brian Orakpo and LaRon Landry). We can rush to judgment all we want after the weekend. Campbell knows better and he’ll wait. “It takes a couple of years to develop a class,” he told reporters this week. “People are saying the ‘14 class had some success. Well, if I read articles and see what happened and what was said right after that draft, our grades in the mock drafts were not very good. It takes time.” That brings to mind another popular saying that Skins fans pray is true, especially when they consider the front office shake-up, Cousins’ contract mess and Snyder’s continued presence: “Good things come to those who wait.” OK. But here’s hoping the Burgundy and Gold don’t need a Cubs-like 108 years after this draft. ⦁ Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/koda-glover-placed-10-day-disabled-list/
Koda Glover placed on 10-day disabled list Koda Glover said he rehabilitated the torn labrum in his hip the “old-fashioned way” in the offseason when he chose rest, physical therapy and exercise over surgery. Glover was placed on the 10-day disabled list Wednesday by the Nationals because of a left hip impingement. Matt Grace was called up to take his place. Glover, 24, was elevated to be the co-closer, so to speak, with Shawn Kelley once Washington decided to remove Blake Treinen from the roll. Glover has made 11 appearances this season, including three in four days between April 22-25, before being placed on the disabled list. Last season, his first in the major leagues after a rocket rise from Single-A Potomac where he started the year, Glover kept the news that he was having pain in his hip to himself. He made nine appearances after initially feeling the pain in his left leg. Glover said each time he landed it felt like an ice pick was jammed into his hip. He vowed to be smarter and shed the idea that blood was the only marker of injury, and he was to otherwise tough it out. Glover is 0-1 with two saves and a 4.15 ERA in 11 relief appearances this season. His last outing was his worst of the season. Tuesday night, he allowed two runs in one inning in cold Colorado. Losing Glover is another blow to the Nationals’ already ineffective bullpen. It came into Wednesday with the worst ERA in the National League. Three pitchers have been used as closers. Despite the bullpen’s failings, Washington came into Wednesday 14-6, tied for the best record in the major leagues. Grace, 28, joins the Nationals for his first major-league assignment of the season. The left-hander has a 3.60 ERA in 31 career major-league games. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/ann-coulter-drops-plans-visit-berkeley-report/
Ann Coulter drops plans to visit Berkeley: Report Conservative columnist Ann Coulter won’t be going to UC Berkeley Thursday after all. In an email to the Reuters newswire Wednesday, the conservative firebrand said she was canceling her planned trip because “I looked over my shoulder and my allies had joined the other team.” Ms. Coulter made the promise to appear on campus last week in an April 19 tweet, promising “I WILL BE SPEAKING NEXT THURSDAY.” On Monday, Reuters reported that both the Young America’s Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans were taking the school to court for having canceled Ms. Coulter’s planned speech. Campus officials had offered to reschedule the talk to May 2, a request that was turned down by Ms. Coulter, who is on the record complaining that she met the institution’s various demands before scheduling the originally planned speech, only to essentially call their bluff when they canceled the event. Ms. Coulter’s complaint about a lack of support appears to be directed at the Young America’s Foundation (YAF). In an April 25 statement posted to its website, YAF lamented that “Berkeley made it impossible to hold a lecture due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators.” As such, the group said, while it was “pressing forward with its lawsuit” it could not “jeopardize the safety of its staff or students” by joining Ms. Coulter in her planned appearance. Ms. Coultertold The Hollywood Reporter Wednesday that YAF was “basically allying with the administration to keep me off Berkeley” and that it would be “nuts” to show up with “no one on the ground … no lawyer, no insurance, no security” backing her up. Ms. Coulter suggested YAF was too timid in its legal response and that it should have filed a motion in court to effectively order the state’s liberal Democratic governor to call in the National Guard to secure the campus. “Why hasn’t Gov. Jerry Brown ordered the national guard in?” Ms. Coulter said, THR reported. “He might have — if there had been a court order. The way we vindicate constitutional right in this country is by going to court and forcing state actors violating our rights as American citizens to stop. But YAF wouldn’t file for a court order, just damages — which Berkeley doesn’t care about. It’s on the California taxpayers.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

‘Allah’ surname fight for couple’s daughter sparks Georgia lawsuit The Georgia Department of Health faces a lawsuit over a couple’s desire to designate “Allah” as their daughter’s surname. Officials in the Peach State are not keen on giving Elizabeth Handy’s and Bilal Walk’s daughter the appellation and now the ACLU of Georgia is involved. The couple have tried for three years to name their daughter ZalyKha Graceful Lorraina Allah, but to no avail. The Georgia ACLU therefore filed a lawsuit on their behalf on March 23. Andrea Young, the executive director of the Georgia ACLU, told CNN on Thursday that officials are too narrowly reading a regulation that requires parents to use a mother’s last name, the father’s last name or a combination of both when naming their child. “The regulation goes outside the bounds of plain language of statute,” Ms. Young said. Exceptions can be made for a “bona fide cultural tradition.” “This regulation initially did not have exception for bona fide cultural traditions … but who has authority to judge that,” Ms. Young asked. “A clerk, a judge, given whole variety of cultures?” The family’s two sons from a previous marriage, ages 3 and 16, both have the surname “Allah.” “This is always the thing with individual liberties,” Ms. Young continued. “It may not be obvious to other people but in a country that’s based on liberty and freedom of expression these are very personal areas that government shouldn’t have the right to dictate.” The legal limbo has prevented the family from obtaining an official birth certificate and social security number, CNN reported.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/28/police-surveillance-system-hacked-dc-days-prior-tr/
Police surveillance system hacked in D.C. days prior to Trump’s inauguration Surveillance cameras deployed across the nation’s capital abruptly malfunctioned prior to President Trump’s inauguration last week, preventing police from recording video footage for several days leading up to his swearing-in and triggering reinstallation efforts across Washington, D.C., city officials said Friday. The Metropolitan Police Department became aware of problems affecting four of the city’s camera sites on January 12, eight days prior to Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Washington Post reported Friday. Technologists found that two forms of malicious software had infected video recorders at each of the four sites, spurring an investigation that subsequently identified dozens of other affected devices across the District, police officials told the Post. The infections prevented police from using 123 of its 187 video recorders between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, briefly curbing law enforcement’s ability to log footage captured by its network of surveillance cameras located in public places throughout the nation’s capital, the Post reported. Public safety was never jeopardized as a result of the infections, Secret Service spokesman Brian Ebert told the newspaper. Investigators resolved the problem by identifying each of the infected video recorders, then disconnecting those devices from the internet and purging them completely of software before restarting the system, Archana Vemulapalli, the city’s chief technology officer, told the Post. More than a half-million people flocked the city’s streets less than a week after the malware was removed, taking into account Mr. Trump’s inauguration and the massively attended Women’s March protest held the day after. Technologists determined the devices had been infected with two separate strains of ransomware, an increasingly popular and profitable type of malicious software recently attributed with sidelining city computer systems throughout the country, all the while causing upwards millions of dollars in monthly damages, according to the FBI. In the event of ransomware infections, typically vulnerable computers are compromised in a manner that makes them inoperable until the victim either pays the perpetrator or obtains adequate technical advice. The FBI said it doesn’t recommend paying a ransom in response, but recently estimated that extortionists used the cyber-scheme to wring $1 billion out of victims in 2016. The Los Angeles Community College District paid nearly $30,000 to an unidentified perpetrator earlier this month to recover from a campus-wide ransomware infection, and a study conducted last year by IBM Security determined that 70 percent of businesses affected by ransomware ended up making payment. San Francisco’s Municipal Railway decided last year to let passengers ride for free while it tried to purge its ticket machines of ransomware instead of paying up. The incident was raised on Capitol Hill last month by Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, who said he feared “grave and far reaching” repercussions would occur if the same sort of assault targeted Washington, D.C. “These reports highlight how vulnerable our systems are to fast-proliferating ransomware threats,” Mr. Warner told The Washington Times upon being made aware of the latest infection. “The rush to connect ever more products, devices and systems to the internet has not advanced with an adequate focus on device or data security. While many ransomware attacks are opportunistic, with attackers scanning internet connections for insecure devices, incidents like these highlight how devastating a deliberate attack targeting critical infrastructure or sensitive security systems could be.” The cyberattack suffered this month by the city’s surveillance system is under investigation, the Post reported.

Sen. Boxer asks FBI to explain its response to ransomware as hospitals fall victim to cybercriminals Ransomware campaigns being waged at hospitals across the country have prompted Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat, to ask the FBI to explain how its handling a rash of cyberattacks that are affecting health providers from coast to coast. Ms. Boxer on Friday sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey to express what she said were “grave concerns” regarding ransomware infections befallen by hospitals as of late, including an attack last month that forced computer systems at more than 250 facilities in the Washington region to go offline. Ransomware is a name applied to malicious software that seizes data from infected computers until a fee is coughed up to cybercriminals, usually in Bitcoin or similar crypto currency that can’t easily be traced. The FBI believes ransomware cost American companies and citizens at least $24 million in 2015, and attacks waged so far in 2016 suggest hackers are hardly leaving ransomware by the wayside. The Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid cybercriminals nearly $17,000 to regain access to data that was seized during a ransomware attack in February, and doctors and nurses employed by MedStar Health in the Washington, D.C., region resorted to using paper and pen last month when ransomware infected hospital computers and entire systems shut down as a precaution. “I am concerned that by hospitals paying these ransoms, we are creating a perverse incentive for hackers to continue these dangerous attacks,” Ms. Boxer said in Friday’s letter to the FBI chief. “In your response to this letter, please provide information regarding the FBI’s efforts to investigate these crimes and indicate what steps you believe hospitals and other businesses can take to protect themselves both prior to and following a ransomware attack,” she added. When the Hard Times Cafe in Rockville, Maryland, was infected with ransomware last month and forced to briefly close its doors, co-owner Bob Howard told WTOP that the FBI told him the bureau “can’t keep up” with ransomware cases. “The advice is either pay the ransom or shut down your entire systems and rebuild from scratch. And that’s what we’re doing,” Mr. Howard recalled. “The easiest thing may be to just pay the ransom,” Joseph Bonavolonta, a cyber agent with the FBI’s Boston office, said last year. “The amount of money made by these criminals is enormous and that’s because the overwhelming majority of institutions just pay the ransom.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/7/hackers-extort-28k-ransom-los-angeles-college/
Hackers extort $28k ransom from Los Angeles college The Los Angeles Community College District paid nearly $30,000 to regain access to computer systems seized by a ransomware infection that was discovered as students showed up for the first day of classes, educators said this week. Roughly 1,800 teachers and staff of Los Angeles Valley College found themselves unable to access campus computers Tuesday, the start of the semester, due to being targeted by what District Chancellor Francisco Rodriguez described as “malicious cyber activity,” Los Angeles Daily News reported this weekend. College officials notified students of the incident in a campus-wide alert Wednesday, and issued a follow-up Friday that said a ransom had been paid in hopes of regaining access to the compromised computers. “In consultation with district and college leadership, outside cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, a payment of $28,000 was made by the District,” Mr. Rodriguez said in Friday’s statement. “It was the assessment of our outside cybersecurity experts that making a payment would offer an extremely high probability of restoring access to the affected systems, while failure to pay would virtually guarantee that data would be lost.” The payment was made in response to instructions that appeared in a ransom note that was found on school servers this week and displayed on the screens of some affected machines, McClatchy reported. “You have 7 days to send us the BitCoin after 7 days we will remove your private keys and it’s impossible to recover your files,” the note said, as reported first by The Valley Star campus newspaper. “After payment was made, a ‘key’ was delivered to open access to our computer systems,” Mr. Rodriguez said in Friday’s statement. “The process to ‘unlock’ hundreds of thousands files will be a lengthy one, but so far, the key has worked in every attempt that has been made.” The district’s decision to make payment is not uncommon among victims of similar “ransomware” attacks, an internet-enabled extortion tactic that resulted in approximately $209 million during the first three months of 2016, according to the FBI. More recently, San Francisco’s Municipal Railway endured a ransomware infection in Nov. 2016 that resulted in free fares for passengers after light-rail officials decided to take affected machines offline. In lieu of paying the $73,000 request ransom, however, Muni said it suffered roughly $50,000 in lost fares. The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department cyber security unit as well as a private security firm, Crypsis Group of Virginia, are investigating the incident, Daily News reported Saturday.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/19/uc-berkeley-calls-off-ann-coulter-talk-for-securit/
Ann Coulter vows to speak at Berkeley despite cancellation SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Ann Coulter fired off an angry stream of tweets Wednesday vowing to speak as planned next week at the University of California, Berkeley after campus officials called off the event for security concerns. “I WILL BE SPEAKING NEXT THURSDAY,” the right-wing commentator tweeted, calling the move to cancel her planned event on April 27 a ban on free speech. Coulter was invited to speak at Berkeley by campus Republicans on the subject of illegal immigration. The event raised concerns of more violence at Berkeley, where masked rioters smashed windows, set fires and shut down an appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos in February. University officials sent the Berkeley College Republicans a letter Tuesday, saying that officials and campus police had determined they could not ensure the safety of Coulter, audience members or protesters expected at the event. “We have been unable to find a safe and suitable venue,” said the letter from Vice Chancellor Scott Biddy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton. “Given current active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully.” The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter Wednesday. The cancellation comes days after violent clashes between far-right and far-left protesters Saturday at a rally supporting President Donald Trump in downtown Berkeley. University spokesman Dan Mogulof said that campus police learned that some of the groups that appeared to be responsible for the violence last weekend and at the Yiannopoulos event “planned to target the appearance of Ann Coulter on campus.” Last week, posters went up on campus threatening disruption of the event and officials also found chatter on various websites indicating the possibility of planned violence, Mogulof said. In its letter, the university said the students and officials could work together to reschedule the event for a later date. It noted that “most Mondays and Tuesdays in September during the day should work.” Coulter posted eight tweets in a span of 17 minutes after the AP and others reported the cancellation Wednesday. She called claims of the university trying to set up an alternate date “FAKE NEWS!” The event was being co-organized by a campus group called BridgeCal and the Young America’s Foundation, a conservative group that books Coulter’s campus speeches. “We have no intention of acceding to these unconstitutional acts,” the Young America’s Foundation said in a statement. “The Ann Coulter lecture… will go forward.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Mark Warner grills D.C.’s Metro transit system over cybersecurity, warns of ‘grave’ consequences A recent cyberattack suffered by San Francisco’s light-rail system has caused a co-founding member of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus to question whether the nation’s capital could sustain a similar assault. Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, raised his concerns in a letter sent to the general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on Monday amid reports of high-profile systems being seized by ransomware — a type of malicious software the FBI has attributed with causing tens of millions of dollars in losses each month since 2015 when it began being successfully deployed by hackers at an unprecedented degree against targets including schools, police stations and at least one major transit system. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) ultimately let passengers ride for free Thanksgiving weekend after a ransomware infection hindered access to hundreds of agency computers. As with similar ransomware incidents, the individual who took responsibility claimed to have encrypted the contents of the infected computers, and initially demanded roughly $73,000 in Bitcoin in exchange for relinquishing the hack data and restoring access to the systems. The agency said it declined to pay, and instead reportedly accumulated nearly $50,000 in losses by suspending fare while it identified a way to response to the hack. Besides the certain monetary loss, though, Mr. Warner said he fears a similar attack against the D.C. region’s Metro transit system could cause other result in “grave and far reaching” repercussions. “While early reports indicate that the attack on SFMTA may have been opportunistic rather than targeted, I am concerned that WMATA may represent a particularly enticing target for more advanced threats, given its importance to the region and the number of federal agencies that rely on the system to transport their workforces each day,” Mr. Warner wrote. “Should a cyberattack cripple WMATA’s ability to collect fares for days at a time, or have the effect of deterring alarmed riders, the financial implications would only exacerbate WMATA’s serious and mounting fiscal problems,” he said. “A cyberattack could potentially threaten these vital networks as well, putting riders at risk if an accident or emergency were to occur during a cyberattack.” About 868,000 passengers rode the D.C. Metro on a daily basis during the second quarter of 2016, making it the most popular system of its kind in the country second only to New York’s. The system’s physical safety has nonetheless been repeatedly called into question, however, particularly after a passenger died inside a smoke-filled subway car two years ago this week. In order to ensure Metro’s computers are up to snuff, Mr. Warner has asked the agency to provide details with respect to its IT systems and any contingency plans it may have in the event of a potential cyberattack waged at city transit. A statement from his office says he expects Metro to respond to each of his seven cybersecurity questions and other issues addressed in Monday’s letter by February 15. Metro has received the senator’s letter and will provide a timely response, a spokesperson for the agency told The Washington Post this week. The frequency of ransomware attacks has spiked from about 1,000 attacks per day in 2015 to over 4,000 daily in the first quarter of 2016, according to Mr. Warner. Taking into consideration the entire calendar year, the FBI expects extortionists will have generated $1 billion in digital ransom payments during 2016, NBC News reported this week. The Los Angeles Community College District recently paid nearly $30,000 to regain access to computer systems affected by a ransomware infection discovered on the first day of classes, educators said this week.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/6/medstar-hackers-exploited-9-year-old-flaw-hold-hos/
MedStar hackers exploited 9-year-old flaw to hold hospital data for ransom The ransomeware attack that put the computer systems of D.C.-area hospitals at the mercy of hackers last month was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability that has existed for nearly a decade and could have easily been patched, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. A flaw that affects JBoss, an application server used by MedStar Health Inc., was harnessed by the hackers who broke into the hospital chain’s computers recently and took health care data for ransom, sources familiar with an investigation into the breach told AP. MedStar resorted to using paper records after hackers breached its computer network late last month and forced the chain to shut down systems at 10 hospitals and 250 outpatient centers in and around the District for upwards of a week. SEE ALSO: White House transfers nearly $600M from Ebola fight to Zika virus According to the AP report, all that could have been avoided if MedStar had patched a server problem that has been the subject of repeated warnings dating back to 2007. “This old issue is still somehow spread across Internet-facing servers,” Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon of Minded Security, an Italian security firm, told AP. The two researchers were responsible for revealing a similar security flaw in 2010 affecting Red Hat, the company behind JBoss. Red Hat and the U.S. government’s cyber experts have issued security warnings regarding Red Hat, including the issue affecting MedStar, in 2007, 2010 and earlier this week, and news reports have been written for years concerning past breaches achieved by exploiting JBoss vulnerabilities. SEE ALSO: Dennis Hastert attorneys ask for probation, citing remorse and health problems The vulnerability that hackers used to gain access to the hospitals’ networks and install ransomware could have been resolved by deleting two lines of software code, or applying an existing patch, according to AP. “We continuously apply patches and other defenses to protect the security and confidentiality of patient and associate information,” MedStar said in a statement. The FBI began investigating the attack on MedStar since shortly after hackers infiltrated on March 28 and started holding its data hostage. The hackers reportedly demanded $19,000 after infecting the machines with malware, but MedStar said it paid nothing. The impact was limited to archives, imaging files, lab files and duplicates, a source told AP, and a spokesperson for MedStar said there was no evidence patient or employee records were ever compromised. Nevertheless, the subsequent shutdown resulted in instances where individuals were reportedly refused at certain area facilities, and caused a “patient safety issue,” as one doctor told the Washington Post at the time. Joseph Bonavolonta, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Cyber and Counterintelligence Program in the bureau’s Boston office, said last year that the agency often advises victims of these attacks just to pay the ransom. In November, a team of security experts from companies including Symantec and Intel concluded that a particular type of ransomware, CryptoWall, had earned Internet bandits $325 million in only a year; the FBI, meanwhile, believes ransomeware cost companies and individuals across the country more than $24 million in 2015. Digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg told CSO this week that its investigators have been handling a minimum of three ransomware cases a week in 2016. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid $17,000 in cyber-ransom earlier this year, and other recent high-profile victims have included the LA Health Department and the Hard Times Cafe in Rockville, Maryland. “The FBI tells us they can’t keep up with ransomware cases,” Hard Times co-owner Bob Howard told WTOP last month after his business was shuttered for days due to a ransomware infection. “The advice is either pay the ransom or shut down your entire systems and rebuild from scratch. And that’s what we’re doing.” “A lot of people in the health care industry — they set up websites in a kind of fire and forget fashion,” Craig Williams of Cisco Talos Research told Ars Technica last month. “They hire an IT guy, they get the billing system set up, hook it up to the website and then they never touch it again. That’s the perfect environment for this type of malware to thrive in because it’s not maintained. They have no full-time security staff and few if any full-time administrators. As a result, the software just goes unpatched.” “There’s no question this is a serious issue at this point,” Concord Law School of Kaplan University professor Shaun Jamison, Ph.D., told FierceHealthIT recently. “I think we’ll see commitment in health care to address this. It’s hit critical mass. It’s on everyone’s mind, it’s on the news — it’s everywhere.” Mr. Williams, of Talos Research, said his team found approximately 2.1 million systems on the public-facing Internet that can be compromised with the same JBoss exploit used on MedStar, Ars Technica reported. And while the security expert said that hospitals are likely becoming victims of ransomware attacks more often not because they are specifically targeted, but rather due to their reliance on routinely vulnerable applications, NSA Director Mike Rogers on Tuesday singled out the healthcare industry as being a particular ripe target for hackers while discussing cybersecurity concerns.

FBI, DHS investigating ransomware attack against San Francisco’s Muni transit system, agency says San Francisco’s light rail system let passengers ride for free over the weekend after hundreds of its computers were infected with ransomware. The San Francisco Municipal Railroad, “Muni,” said in a statement Monday that it has begun working with both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security after suffering from a ransomware infection that resulted in complimentary fares during the weekend for some riders. Muni learned Friday morning that malware had encrypted and accordingly affected access to approximately 900 office computers as well as other various systems, the transit agency said Monday. Affected machines were compromised to display the message “You Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted,” as well as details about how to restore access in exchange for a hefty ransom. No data was stolen, and not a penny was paid of the roughly $73,000 sought by the actor responsible, Muni said. Nonetheless, the agency said it decided to turn off ticket machines and fare gates at its Muni Metro subway stations from Friday morning through Sunday “to minimize any potential risk or inconvenience” to transit passengers. “We made the decision to shut down those (gates) until we knew what we were dealing with and what the impact on customers would be,” SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose told the San Francisco Chronicle. “Once we learned that customers’ information was not part of this, we turned them back on.” Muni “never considered paying the ransom,” the agency said in Monday’s statement. “We have an information technology team in place that can restore our systems, and that is what they are doing,” the statement continued. “Existing backup systems allowed us to get most affected computers up and running this morning, and our information technology team anticipates having the remaining computers functional in the next day or two.” As Muni scrambled to respond during the post-Thanksgiving weekend, however, the agency resorted in the interim to assigning routes to drivers by way of handwritten notes in stead of traditional user printouts, the San Francisco Examiner reported. “With enough knowledge, hackers can create real disaster related to train safety,” said Idan Udi Edry, CEO of Nation-E, a cybersecurity company that emphasizes protecting critical infrastructure. Security researchers who reviewed the message left by the Muni hacker don’t believe a major city’s transit system was specifically targeted, however. Instead, rather, experts who have analyzed the attack said it appears the hacker scanned the internet looking for computers that run a vulnerable version of Oracle WebLogic, a Java application server used by Muni, Ars Technica reported. When the San Francisco Examiner sent an email to the hacker whose address appeared in the ransom message, they replied: “We do this for money, nothing else.” Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat, wroteFBI Director James Comey in April expressing concern after Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles admitted paying nearly $17,000 to regain access to data encrypted during a ransomware infection. “Ransomware attacks are not only proliferating, they’re becoming more sophisticated,” the FBI said in an article published to its website later that month that cited a rash of infections suffered in previous months by victims ranging from hospitals and school districts to state and local governments and businesses. “The inability to access the important data these kinds of organizations keep can be catastrophic in terms of the loss of sensitive or proprietary information, the disruption to regular operations, financial losses incurred to restore systems and files and the potential harm to an organization’s reputation,” the FBI said. In May, the FBI said ransomware infections caused more than $1.6 million in damages during 2015. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/6/congress-transfers-nearly-600m-ebola-fight-zika/
White House transfers nearly $600M from Ebola fight to Zika virus The White House will shift more than $500 million away from the Ebola fight in West Africa to combat the Zika virus that’s been linked to serious birth defects, tacitly caving to GOP demands Wednesday, though officials still want nearly $2 billion from Congress to combat the mosquito-borne illness. Cabinet officials said their transfer of $510 million from Ebola and $79 million from other accounts will prop up research into a better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika and bolster efforts to eradicate the pesky mosquito that ferries the virus. Top Republicans had pressed for the shift in funds for months, rejecting the administration’s pleas for new money and saying the Ebola account could be tapped. SEE ALSO: DEA to decide within months whether to change federal status of marijuana But the White House insisted the quick infusion isn’t enough, and says Mr. Obama will still insist on an additional $1.9 billion to replenish the Ebola money and expand Zika efforts even more. “Without the full amount of requested emergency supplemental funding, many activities that need to start right now would have to be delayed or curtailed or stopped within months,” said Shaun Donovan, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Zika has been linked to a surge in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, in Brazil and other Latin American countries. It’s also been tied to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis. SEE ALSO: Sicker-than-expected patients challenge Obamacare’s viability The virus has also been detected in Puerto Rico and some sexually transmitted cases have been recorded in the U.S., and it could puncture deeper into the mainland in coming months. But the administration’s request faces a tough time on Capitol Hill, where GOP leaders are already struggling to pass a fiscal 2017 budget amid a conservative rebellion over higher spending levels. Additional Zika money could inflame that fight. House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers says the administration hasn’t spent about $2.7 billion of the $5.3 billion set aside to deal with the Ebola outbreak, and that Congress could backfill the use of those funds during the fiscal 2017 appropriations process. On Wednesday he praised the White House’s move. “These resources — which the agencies already have on hand — will help stop the growth of this devastating disease around the world, and prepare for and protect against outbreaks within our borders,” the Kentucky Republican said. The administration had long said it might repurpose some of its Ebola funding on top of its supplemental request, though on Wednesday it said that amount should not be debited from the pending request. “I want to be very clear that our $1.9 billion request remains our $1.9 billion request,” Mr. Donovan said, arguing Congress should not force them to choose between fighting Zika and fighting Ebola. The administration has said it wants to totally stamp out Ebola, which has killed more than 11,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since December 2013. Officials pointed to a cluster of flare-ups in Guinea and the Ebola-related death of a 30-year-old woman in Liberia last week, just days after the World Health Organization said the outbreak was no longer a public health emergency of international concern. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the WHO’s declaration means Ebola is winding down, so it is time to redirect those funds to Zika. “By doing this, we can protect against outbreaks without burdening the taxpayers further,” the California Republican said. Though Zika isn’t spreading by mosquitoes in the continental U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 312 travel-related cases in the 50 states and D.C., including 27 cases in pregnant women. U.S. territories have reported 349 cases of locally acquired infection, mostly in Puerto Rico. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said a baby born with microcephaly in Hawaii tested positive for Zika, and states like Texas and Florida will be on the front lines of local transmission this summer. As temperatures climb, the climate becomes more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Republicans in affected states will regret not falling in line behind Mr. Obama’s request. “I guess at some point,” he said, “they’re going to have to choose whether or not their animosity toward President Obama trumps their desire to try to protect pregnant women in their states from this terrible disease.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/6/dennis-hastert-attorneys-ask-probation-citinh-remo/
Dennis Hastert attorneys ask for probation, citing remorse and health problems Citing a deep remorse and health problems, attorneys for former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert asked a federal judge to sentence him to probation rather than time in jail for charges related to hush money payments he made to cover up past misconduct. Defense attorney Thomas Green submitted a sentencing memo Wednesday describing Hastert’s fall from grace as “swift and devastating,” and asked that Judge Thomas M. Durkin consider the totality of his life and his years in public service. “First and foremost, Hastert is deeply sorry and apologizes for his misconduct that occurred decades ago and the resulting harm he caused to others,” Mr. Green wrote in the court filing. The Illinois Republican pleaded guilty in last year to violating bank laws as he sought to pay $3.5 million in hush money to a person in order to cover up past “misconduct.” The misconduct dates back to the time Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach at an Illinois high school. Hastert taught at Yorkville High School from 1965 to 1981 before entering politics. The Associated Press and other media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have reported that Hastert wanted to hide claims that he sexually molested someone. The sentencing memo from Hastert’s attorneys stops short of acknowledging the accusations of sexual abuse. “Neither we as his lawyers, nor Mr. Hastert, have the present insight to understand and reconcile the unfortunate and harmful incidents he caused decades ago with the enduring achievements, leadership, and generosity that earned him extraordinary affection and respect throughout this country during his many years of public service,” the sentencing memo from Mr. Green states. “What we do know is that he will stand before the Court having deteriorated both physically and emotionally, undoubtedly in part due to public shaming and humiliation of an unprecedented degree.” Disclosures from a closed March hearing in the case have indicated that an alleged sex abuse victim could testify at Hastert’s sentencing hearing, scheduled for April 27. The sentencing memo filed by Hastert’s attorneys highlights the shame and scorn the former politician has endured since the charges were first filed. “Since his indictment, Mr. Hastert’s work and his reputation have become forever tainted,” the court filing states. “Mr. Hastert has been stung by the public repudiations of him that followed his indictment, including the removal of his portrait from the United States Capitol, the removal of his name from the public landmarks for which he passionately fought, and the characterization of his legacy as a ‘black eye’ on his county.” It also details significant health issues that have arisen since Hastert pled guilty in October. Hastert’s diabetes has become a problem, he’s been diagnosed with a rare blood stream infection, and he suffered a stroke while hospitalized. The court filing characterized Hastert as needing daily assistance with most daily activities, such as getting out of bed, getting dressed, going to the bathroom, and bathing. “As Mr. Hastert’s counsel, we respectfully request that the Court in imposing a sentence consider the totality of the circumstances that surround this violation, his regret and acceptance of responsibility, the cost that has already been exacted over the past year, as well as Mr. Hastert’s fragile medical condition,” the sentencing memo states. Federal sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence between zero and six months in prison for the offense, though a judge could hand down a sentence of up to five years.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/25/ransomware-infections-led-16-million-losses-during/
Ransomware infections led to $1.6 million in losses during 2015: Report An FBI report released Tuesday said that ransomware infections caused more than $1.6 million in losses last year for individuals and businesses, even before experts began sounding the alarm over a cyber epidemic whose latest victims include yet another medical center following a slew of hacks affecting hospitals coast to coast. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, IC3, said in an annual report published this week that it received 2,453 complaints during the last calendar year concerning ransomware — a type of malware that allows hackers to take hold of an infected computer’s contents, usually until a victim agrees to pay a fee. All told, criminal cyber activity ranging from hacktivist attacks to credit card fraud resulted in the IC3 receiving 288,012 complaints last year totaling more than $1.07 billion in reported losses. Of that sum, ransomware resulted in $1,620,814 in adjusted losses during the last calendar year, the report concluded. Although the 236-page report indicates ransomware was nowhere near as prevalent as some other cyber-schemes during 2015, statistics suggest criminals are capitalizing more than ever off of the money-making scam. The IC3 only began making mention of ransomware in its 2012 report, and previously said it was aware of 1,402 ransomware victims during the second half of 2014, the likes of which was said to have resulted in roughly $490,000 in losses, or less than one-third of what last year’s infections yielded. As Motherboard reported Wednesday, however, the IC3’s statistics only take into account instances where ransomware victims went to the authorities, and overwhelmingly elate to domestic incidents. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said previously that it spotted 179,209 computers in 2015 that had been infected with ransomware, and CNN said in April that the cost of those infections had amounted to $24 million. In February, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center made headlines when the Los Angeles-area hospital announced that it had paid thousands of dollars to recover computer files that had been seized as the result of ransomware. MedStar Health Inc. shuttered computer networks at 10 hospitals and 250 outpatient centers across the greater Washington, D.C. region after becoming similarly infected in March, and in April the FBI released its second ransomware warning in four months. Most recently, the president of Kansas Heart Hospital announced this week that it recently paid “a small amount” to ransomware perpetrators, only for the attackers to respond by asking for more. ThreatTrack Security, a Florida-based firm, plans to release a report next week after interviewing 250 security professionals from the U.S. and determining nearly one-in-three are willing to pay ransom to recover their data. With regards to organizations that have already fallen victim to “cyberextortionists,” the report will say that more than half would likely pay a second ransom. “Victims are faced with the choice of paying up or losing all their valuable data forever. Unfortunately, this approach works for cybercriminals, because consumers and businesses are unprepared for their data – whether it’s a business’ intellectual property or family photos – to be taken from them with no hope of retrieval unless they pay,” said Usman Choudhary, ThreatTrack’s chief product officer. “Understandably, nearly 1 in 3 security professionals at companies say they’d be willing to pay for the safe recovery of stolen or encrypted data, and that number jumps to 55 percent at organizations that have already been targeted. Meanwhile, your average home user feels as if they have no choice but to pay,” he said in a statement. Scams in which goods and services are shipped and payment is never rendered, and vice versa, ranked first nationally with respect to the number of victims, according to the IC3 report. In terms of financial damages, meanwhile, “Business Email Compromise” scams in which fraudsters use social engineering and hacking techniques to infiltrate legitimate business accounts ranked first with $246,226,016 in reported losses, according to the report.

DEA to decide within months whether to change federal status of marijuana The Drug Enforcement Administration says it plans to decide within the next several months whether to change the federal status of marijuana, according to a letter sent to lawmakers this week. Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, alongside the likes of LSD and heroin, which means it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. Rescheduling could make it easier for researchers to study potential uses of the drug, a move that medical marijuana advocates would cheer. The letter to lawmakers, signed by the heads of the DEA, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, states that the DEA has received scientific and medical evaluations as well as a scheduling recommendation from HHS and that it hopes to release a determination on rescheduling “in the first half of 2016.” The letter does not disclose the HHS rescheduling recommendation. Rescheduling of a Schedule I to a Schedule II drug is rare. The DEA has done so just five times, according to a 2015 report by the Brookings Institution. While Schedule II drugs are still classified as having high potential for abuse, they have an accepted medical use in treatment and can be prescribed under tight restrictions. Morphine, oxycodone and cocaine fall into this category. “Reclassifying cannabis will make scientific research easier and will send a strong signal that the U.S. government is finally ready to acknowledge that marijuana has medical value,” said Tom Angell, chairman of the advocacy group the Marijuana Majority. Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego, is one researcher with firsthand experience navigating the bureaucratic hurdles it takes to gain approval for a marijuana study. He says past studies aimed at determining whether marijuana has medicinal effects have taken six to 18 months just to gain approval. Rescheduling marijuana would make it easier to obtain approvals and require a research facility to get federal agencies to sign off on related studies or study modifications less often, Dr. Grant said. “It would make it easier practically,” he said. With the arduous constraints in place, others have opted instead to engage in clinical trials to study effects of cannabinoids, the active compound in marijuana, rather than marijuana itself. Kevin Hill, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital, is overseeing two studies involving cannabinoids that he said may help determine ways to treat a small percentage of marijuana users who become addicted to the drug. Using cannabinoids that are Schedule II and Schedule III drugs makes it easier to get federal agencies to sign off on the studies. That still doesn’t address the reality that with marijuana legal for medicinal use in 23 states and the District of Columbia, a lot of people are using marijuana as medicine to treat ailments that haven’t been well-studied, Dr. Hill said. “We need to have more of the evidence,” he said. While researchers remain hopeful, others are skeptical that the DEA will reschedule marijuana. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which is against recreational marijuana legalization, said rescheduling would be more of a symbolic victory for advocates than a real victory for researchers. He agrees that it should be easier for researchers to study the effects of marijuana and argues that the DEA could support such research by rescheduling additional cannabinoid compounds as Schedule II or Schedule III drugs — but he sees rescheduling the drug itself as a step too far. “It’s very different,” Mr. Sabet said. “We don’t smoke opium to get the effects of morphine.” The DEA has a history of rejecting petitions to reschedule marijuana, with the latest shot down in 2011, according to the Brookings Institution. But since the last rejection, a slew of medical groups and researchers have come out in favor of rescheduling. The American Academy of Pediatrics last year recommended that the DEA reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug to make it easier to facilitate clinical trial research of the drug in the hopes of finding benefits for children. The Epilepsy Foundation of America, a national nonprofit advocating on behalf of epilepsy patients, has also come out in favor of access to cannabis for seizure sufferers. Amid growing support nationwide for legalization of medical and recreational use of marijuana, DEA acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg has taken issue with arguments regarding potential medical benefits of marijuana being used to push legalization efforts. In a meeting with reporters late last year, Mr. Rosenberg acknowledged that some extracts of marijuana have shown potential to treat illnesses including childhood epilepsy, but he said that shouldn’t be construed to mean that smoking marijuana is safe. “We can have an intellectually honest debate about whether or not we want to legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don’t call it medicine. That’s a joke,” he said. “My view is that we will support any legitimate research into the efficacy of marijuana for its constituent parts as a medicine. But I think the notion that state legislatures just decree it so is ludicrous.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/obamacare-customers-are-sicker-and-costlier-pre-20/
Sicker-than-expected patients challenge Obamacare’s viability New Obamacare customers are sicker and costlier than customers who bought insurance before President Obama’s massive health overhaul, one of the country’s top insurance companies said Wednesday, giving more ammunition to critics who say the law is broken. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said Americans who enrolled in its Obamacare state-level exchange plans in 2014 and 2015, after the health law was fully up and running, had higher rates of diabetes, HIV and other diseases, and visited emergency rooms more frequently than pre-Obamacare enrollees and those who got coverage through their jobs. The new customers also cost an average of 19 percent more than those with employer-based insurance in 2014 and 22 percent more in 2015, Blue Cross said, undercutting the chief argument Mr. Obama used to sell his plan to the country in 2009 and 2010. The Health and Human Services Department said Blue Cross’ methodology was “seriously flawed” because it makes bogus comparisons between different pools of customers. HHS officials said analysts had always expected an initial run by sicker people eager to get medical treatment, which explains the surge in costlier customers. The Obama administration said that’s why the Affordable Care Act built in transition programs to assume some of the risks in the law’s initial years. “After years of being discriminated against, Americans with pre-existing conditions are no longer locked out of coverage because of a health condition like asthma or diabetes,” HHS spokesman Benjamin Wakana said Wednesday. “It’s no surprise that people who newly gained access to coverage under the Affordable Care Act needed health care; that’s why they were locked out of coverage before.” The administration has said it’s working to try to entice healthier customers to sign up for Obamacare. That would keep premiums in check, while clamping down on special enrollment periods that tend to draw higher-cost customers into the exchanges. But the higher rate of ER visits Blue Cross found is difficult to reconcile with Obamacare’s goals. The law’s advocates had said the law was designed in part to get customers signed up with regular doctors, so they could catch problems earlier and reduce the need for costly emergency room visits. Blue Cross urged brand-new customers to try to avoid unnecessary ER visits, and to follow their prescriptions and make regular visits to a primary care doctor. “The findings underscore the need for all of us in the health care system, and newly insured consumers, to work together to make sure that people get the right health care service in the right care setting and at the right time,” said Alissa Fox, a Blue Cross Blue Shield senior vice president. The findings are noteworthy because Blue Cross plans serve millions on the Obamacare’s Web-based exchanges in 46 states and D.C. Insurer complaints And they echo complaints from other top insurers such as UnitedHealth Group, which said it is hemorrhaging money on the exchanges due to a much sicker-than-expected customer base. UnitedHealth has warned it might pull out of the Obamacare marketplace by 2017 if things don’t improve, though other plans have said they plan to stick it out and see if the market stabilizes. In Blue Cross’s data, Obamacare-era enrollees filled 35 percent more prescriptions in 2015 than pre-reform individuals, and 6 percent more than members covered under their employers’ plans. In-patient hospital admission rates among newer enrollees were 38 percent higher compared to pre-reform enrollees and 23 percent higher than employer-insured members. Obamacare requires almost all Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty, a lever designed to balance out the influx of sicker patients who cannot be denied coverage with the law’s passage. The $695 baseline tax for 2016 was phased in from $95 in 2014 and $325 in 2015, and analysts say it might not have had enough bite to prod healthier people into the exchanges in the early rounds. Congressional Republicans seeking to repeal and replace the law with a GOP president in 2017 argue the law is “stalling out” because coverage on the federal HealthCare.gov website and exchanges run by 12 states and D.C. is unaffordable. The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday said that’s why the administration keeps shifting its expectations for enrollment. It hoped to have 9.1 million paying customers by the end of 2015, but earlier this month it said it fell short of that goal by about 300,000, due to excess attrition. The administration hopes to retain about 10 million of the 12.7 million customers the exchanges brought in for 2016, yet that is less than half of what congressional budget scorekeepers initially predicted. HHS officials argue that the initial projections were based on faulty assumptions about the employer-based insurance market, while House Republicans contend that exchange plans “are just not worth the high cost.” “Americans want affordable, high–quality health care coverage,” the Ways and Means Committee said, “not the government-mandated expensive plans, limited choices and lower-quality coverage that come with Obamacare.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Sessions helps stabilize volatile Justice Department in first 100 days The Justice Department has had perhaps the roughest ride of any Cabinet branch during the first 100 days of the Trump administration, facing hostile judges who have blocked the president’s immigration plans, the ouster of the acting attorney general and even accusations of racism leveled against Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing for attorney general. But the department, working arm in arm with the Department of Homeland Security, also has covered the most ground when it comes to implementing the administration’s priorities. Mr. Sessions has been able to reverse course on Obama-era policies, including deploying more immigration judges to the border and prioritizing prosecutions of illegal immigrants who commit crimes in order to speed up deportations, stepping back from use of court-enforced agreements meant to guide local police reforms, and rescinding orders that would have phased out the federal government’s use of private prisons. “Jeff Sessions may have inherited the most difficult period of any modern attorney general,” said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. “But I think General Sessions has tried to bring some greater stability and order to the department.” To observers of the Sessions Justice Department, one of the most notable changes has been the shift in how officials talk about violent crime. Though crime rates remain at near historic lows, Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump have voiced concern about a growing crime wave — pointing to increases in violent crime and homicides in some major cities in 2015 and the first half of 2016. Campaign promises to restore “law and order” have in turn led to calls for crackdowns on drug cartels and illegal immigration. “A lot of it has been laying the foundation for things to come — the way the administration talks about crime and talks about drugs,” said Ames Grawert, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice Program. “That’s a big shift in rhetoric. What we have seen is using that fear and idea of a crime wave … to try to justify what the administration wants to do in rolling back some Obama-era criminal justice policies.” That has included a more heavy-handed approach to dealing with immigration crimes. During his first visit to the U.S.-Mexico border as attorney general in April, Mr. Sessions touted the deployment of 25 immigration judges to the border to help reduce the backlog of deportation cases and plans to hire 125 more. He has also instructed prosecutors to prioritize charges against illegal immigrants with histories of illegally crossing the border into the U.S. and threatened to cut federal funding from jurisdictions with “sanctuary” policies that hamper cooperation with federal immigration agents. Other efforts are seen as more symbolic. Three early executive orders issued by Mr. Trump are meant to “reduce crime and restore public safety.” Though they include few concrete policy changes, Mr. Grawert said, the orders give the attorney general carte blanche to chart a new path forward on criminal justice policy. Where rhetoric has translated into action, opponents of Mr. Trump’s policies said the Justice Department has forecast a discouraging path forward when it comes to civil rights. “The Department of Justice has moved with disturbing speed to reverse many of the positions it took during the prior administration,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Case in point, she said, was the Justice Department’s announcement of a systemwide review of active investigations of troubled law enforcement agencies and its attempt to scuttle approval of a court-stipulated agreement to reform the Baltimore Police Department. A federal judge ultimately signed off on the Obama administration-brokered agreement, a move supported by the city’s mayor and police commissioner. But civil rights advocates worry that efforts to reform of troubled agencies and prosecute officers who will grind to a halt under Mr. Sessions. The reception hasn’t been all bad though, as the nation’s largest police union views the commitment to re-evaluate whether timely and often costly consent decrees are the best solutions. “We are very much heartened and encouraged by the initiatives thus far and hope he is able to build momentum,” said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police. “He may come at it from a more conservative perspective, but that’s what makes the world go ’round.” Analysts say part of what has made Mr. Sessions effective at the head of the department is his predictability. The policies he is pursuing are the same he has spent years advocating during his time in the Senate and as a U.S. attorney. “If you had to pick someone to implement a law-and-order agenda and know what he was doing and be dedicated to the tough-on-crime rhetoric, it’s Jeff Sessions,” Mr. Grawert said. “He had an idea of what he wanted to do going in, so it’s less surprising he was able to do so much of it in the first 100 days.” Other changes include rescinding of an Obama-era memo that would have ended the government’s use of private prisons, something activists read as a signal that more beds will be needed to house an impending increase in the number of people behind bars. The Justice Department also reversed its yearslong federal support for a legal challenge to Texas’ toughest-in-the-nation voter identification law, an “astonishing” about-face for the groups that previously argued alongside the department, Ms. Ifill said. One area that has proved to be a stumbling block for the Justice Department has been its defense of some of Mr. Trump’s most controversial executive orders, including the temporary ban on refugee resettlement and travel by foreign nationals to the U.S. from six majority Muslim countries. The first and second versions of the order were met with a flurry of lawsuits brought by immigrant and civil liberties advocates. Justice Department lawyers were tasked with defending the first order even before Mr. Sessions was sworn in, but since his confirmation they have been unable to persuade federal judges to let the revised version of the order to go into effect. The swell of resistance during Mr. Trump’s first months in office may have slowed the rollout of other proposals, particularly a plan to handle the medical and recreational marijuana industries, observers say. Mr. Sessions has long made clear that he opposes marijuana legalization and believes the drug is dangerous. He has repeated these positions numerous times since taking the helm at the Justice Department. “It is somewhat surprising to see General Sessions raise the issue of marijuana so forcefully. His department is already stretched fairly thin across several fronts from immigration to sanctuary cities,” Mr. Turley said. Support for medical and recreational marijuana legalization is polling high, even in states Mr. Trump won. Legal markets are reaping billions of dollars in revenue, and Republicans are supportive of states’ rights. Repealing Obama-era policies that allowed the markets to develop and prosper could become a quagmire for the administration. To continue with the forward momentum on policy priorities, Mr. Sessions might be better advised to look the other way on marijuana for now and dedicate Justice Department resources to the battles it is currently fighting rather than creating new fronts, Mr. Turley said. “To throw marijuana policies into that mix could undermine all of these efforts,” Mr. Turley said. “You can’t go to war with everyone.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Va. first lady Dorothy McAuliffe weighs House run in 2018 Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock is in for a number of Democratic challengers in her 2018 re-election bid — a list that may include Virginia first lady Dorothy McAuliffe. Ms. McAuliffe made her intentions known this week through her husband, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who said in an interview with The Washington Post that his wife was “very seriously considering” a run against Ms. Comstock in Virginia’s tenth congressional district. Ms. McAuliffe would be the fifth Democrat to join the race to unseat Ms. Comstock, a Republican currently serving her second term in Congress. The district is historically red, but Hillary Clinton won the district over Donald Trump in November, giving Democrats some hope they can take the seat. This is expected to be one of next year’s most competitive House races. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Aide: Blacks not trying hard enough to work with Trump NEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump’s liaison to the black community, the former “Apprentice” star Omarosa Manigault, says African-American activists aren’t trying hard enough to work with the new administration. The White House aide delivered the pointed message in an interview with The Associated Press in advance of an appearance Thursday at the annual convention of an activist organization founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton. “We’re here waiting, willing to work with the community,” Manigault said when asked about Trump’s moves to slash programs that benefit minorities. “This president wants to engage. It’s not a one-way street.” She was more measured Thursday afternoon as she faced hundreds of black activists, who, like African-American voters across the nation last fall, overwhelmingly opposed Trump’s presidency. Several participants refused to utter the president’s name in convention sessions, referring to the 45th president only by the number 45. Trump got just 8 percent of the African-American vote last November, according to exit polls. “I’m ready,” Manigault told the crowd as some murmured their disapproval. “I know what I came into, and I ain’t never scared.” She insisted she’s spent her first 100 days in Washington fighting for the black community. She noted that Trump has met personally with the Congressional Black Caucus and the presidents of historically black colleges and universities. Manigault called on black leaders to help the struggling institutions as well. “As I fight for you from the White House, I need you to fight on the outside,” she said from the podium of a Manhattan hotel ballroom. The audience listened to Manigault without interruption. Afterward, from the same podium, Sharpton expressed skepticism. He noted that Trump’s proposed budget includes less money for historically black institutions than the final year of President Obama’s presidency. Others previously complained that Trump plans to slash training, education and health care programs that benefit minorities. Sharpton told Manigault to deliver a message to the new president when she returned to Washington. “I wish the president would respect us,” Sharpton said, dismissing Trump’s early black outreach as little more than photo ops. He added, “We, as blacks and women, are in the first 100 days seeing a disaster in Washington, D.C.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

State Department official to visit Michigan charter school MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) - A U.S. State Department official plans to visit a Detroit-area charter school with many students who are children of Christian Middle Eastern immigrants. School officials say in a release that Deputy Assistant Secretary Joseph Pennington is scheduled to visit Keys Grace Academy Charter School Friday in Madison Heights. Keys Grace has roughly 400 Middle Eastern children mainly of Chaldean, Assyrian and Syriac backgrounds from Iraq and Syria. The release says Pennington will tour the school and observe how the students are learning and adjusting to life in the United States. He has served as deputy assistant for Iraq in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and also was stationed in Iraq as Consul General in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.
