President Donald Trump was set to announce Saturday, on the 100th day of his presidency, that he was withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement - the sort of disruptive proclamation that would upend both global and domestic politics and signal to his base that he was keeping his campaign promise to terminate what he once called "a total disaster" and "one of the worst deals ever." "I was all set to terminate," Trump said in an Oval Office interview Thursday night. "I looked forward to terminating. I was going to do it." There was just one problem: Trump's team - like on so many issues - was deeply divided. As news of the president's plan reached Ottawa and Mexico City in the middle of the week and rattled the markets and Congress, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and others huddled in meetings with Trump, urging him not to sign a document triggering a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA. Perdue even brought along a prop to the Oval Office: A map of the United States that illustrated the areas that would be hardest hit, particularly from agriculture and manufacturing losses, and highlighting that many of those states and counties were "Trump country" communities that had voted for the president in November. "It shows that I do have a very big farmer base, which is good," Trump recalled. "They like Trump, but I like them, and I'm going to help them." By Wednesday night, Trump - who spent nearly two years as a candidate railing against the trade agreement - had backed down, saying that conversations with advisers and phone calls with the leaders of Canada and Mexico had persuaded him to reconsider. Recalling his late Wednesday conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump said, "He said to me, 'I would really appreciate if we could negotiate instead of you terminating, because terminating sets a lot of things in motion that could be pretty devastating for a lot of people.' " Trump's declaration to withdraw from NAFTA, followed by his abrupt turnabout, was the latest in a series of abrupt policy shifts and outright reversals in the frenzied lead-up to his 100th day in office, reflecting a president desperate to notch tangible victories and to offer the impression of forward momentum. It was also another example of the inherent tension between the fiery populist, who ran on a promise to upend Washington, and the pragmatic businessman, who is eager to score wins and is easily influenced by a cadre of chief executive friends and top advisers, many with Wall Street pedigrees. Trump announced that he was not labeling China a currency manipulator, after months of promising to do so on Day One of his presidency. And he declared NATO "no longer obsolete," after months of saying it was.

President Donald Trump speaks before signing a memorandum regarding the aluminum industry at the White House on April 27, 2017. He threatened to shut down the government over the border wall, only to retreat on funding for an actual brick-and-mortar structure. And he tasked his team with drafting a complex overhaul of the nation's tax code only to suddenly announce, surprising even his own aides and advisers, that he expected a proposal to be rolled out within days. In some ways, as Trump nears the 100-day mark of his presidency, he is arguably beginning to find his footing, concentrating on core issues that have always animated him (trade) and others that captivate his business side (taxes). By refocusing on questions of trade and the economy, Trump has returned to more familiar and comfortable territory - the nationalistic populism that has defined him since the 1980s. "The president has put himself in a perfect position on NAFTA because folks know he's inclined [to be] negative on NAFTA, yet he's open to negotiating," said Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. "It's a good spot to be. The leverage is all with the president." Unlike his first failed attempt at passing a Republican replacement for President Barack Obama's health-care law, Trump and his team are directing as much activity as possible from within the West Wing, relying on executive orders rather than the more unwieldy but durable process of legislation. But the approach has worried and alienated many of his closest allies, on Capitol Hill, on K Street and abroad. And it has showcased a president who often seems more interested in short-term accomplishments - and positive cable news headlines - than longer-term policy goals guided by ideology, and who can be swayed by unfolding events or compelling arguments from whomever he talks to last. "I think they're just going to act whenever they can on executive action," said Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax, a conservative media company, and a longtime friend of Trump's. "The problem is it's very temporary, but he wants to get things done, and trade has always been one of his big issues." Trump, Ruddy added, "is a business guy. He thinks that America gets a bad part of these deals, and he wants to renegotiate them." President Donald Trump said he has told the leaders of Mexico and Canada that he will not pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement at this time, but could still withdraw if he concludes a renegotiated pact is not "a fair deal for all."

President Donald Trump said he has told the leaders of Mexico and Canada that he will not pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement at this time, but could still withdraw if he concludes a renegotiated pact is not "a fair deal for all." Trump tweeted early Thursday that he has agreed... With Saturday's 100-day marker fast approaching, and eager for a win, the president turned his attention to taxes. Trump had privately groused that he wished he had tackled taxes before trying to push through health care, a view magnified by some outside friends and confidants. Even something more modest than the full overhaul for which he hoped, such as cutting corporate tax rates, they said, would provide the president and his base with an energizing triumph. But it was an April 19 op-ed in the New York Times, titled "Why Are Republicans Making Tax Reform So Hard?" and penned by Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, that helped propel Trump to act. The op-ed, written by conservatives who have strong influence within the White House, said an overhaul of the tax code would give Trump a much-needed "legislative victory" and complained that the White House "seems to be all over the map on the subject." It called on the administration to move quickly on a tax proposal, not to overthink it and to push forward "with some degree of urgency." Trump saw the op-ed right as he was becoming restless with the success of his economic agenda. The White House rushed to engage the op-ed's authors and reassure the economic conservatives who have privately complained about Trump's nationalistic streak on trade and the lack of action of taxes. When Kudlow and Moore gathered a group of conservatives Tuesday evening at Cafe Berlin, a white-tablecloth German restaurant on Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stopped by, even though he was not scheduled to attend. "We texted him and said, 'Come by if you'd like,' " Kudlow said. "Well, he did, and he spoke for two or three minutes and took questions." "Everyone looked around and said, 'This is the Steve we knew during the campaign,' " Kudlow added, referring to Mnuchin's enthusiasm for sweeping tax cuts. On April 21, two days after the op-ed ran, Trump announced in an interview with the Associated Press that his advisers would be releasing a tax plan by the following Wednesday, or "shortly thereafter." Some aides working on the plan were stunned, caught unaware of the expedited timeline. Still, they reasoned, maybe "shortly thereafter" meant they could unveil the plan a week or two later. But hours after the AP interview, during an appearance at the Treasury Department, Trump stood beside Mnuchin and told reporters that the tax plan would come out Wednesday. The proposal unveiled that day offered some specifics - cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and collapsing seven tax brackets down into three - but was vague in other areas, including just how the government would pay for it. Critics seized on the one-page printout the White House distributed Wednesday with details of the tax plan as the flimsy embodiment of its lack of depth. "It was a restatement of bullet points that Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore drafted on the back of a cocktail napkin at the 21 Club," quipped one longtime Washington Republican in contact with the White House. But the tax proposal - unveiled with great fanfare in a midday briefing with reporters - achieved several of Trump's key objectives, garnering him a day of largely positive headlines; laying at least a baseline marker for a top policy goal; and reassuring Americans, many of whom voted for the promise of a businessman commander in chief, that pocketbook relief would be arriving by next tax season. "The president was being ill-advised that he had to repeal Obamacare before passing taxes," said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump adviser. "The two are mutually exclusive." Kudlow spent Wednesday at the White House, chatting with top officials following the rollout of a plan that many credited him with helping to spur. "If we helped, I'm very pleased," Kudlow said. "I think the president has set a terrific tax reform, economic growth marker." Still, he dismissed the suggestion that he was the impetus for Trump's swift action on taxes. The president, Kudlow said, "just wants to move. He's been tied in knots on health care, and he had an impulse to get it together on taxes."

On Twitter Tuesday morning, Trump said that "Canada has made business for our dairy... Canada and Mexico were blindsided Wednesday as news of Trump's planned NAFTA withdrawal spread north and south of the border. Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, described the news as a "my way or the highway ambush" from the White House, especially coming amid what has been weeks of steady and amicable discussions among the three countries about revamping the trade agreement. But Mexico - which was already on edge following Trump's brief flirtation with attaching border-wall funding to a must-pass, short-term spending bill - quickly leapt to action. Two cabinet-level officials in Mexico reached out to their U.S. counterparts to deliver a blunt message: If Trump officially announced the U.S. intention to withdraw from NAFTA, Mexico would not return to the negotiating table. Mexico would not, the officials warned, negotiate with "a gun to its head." The president, meanwhile, was hearing a similar message from some of his own senior advisers. Ross, the commerce secretary, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, scrambled to persuade Trump to back down. The United States can only trigger the six-month clock to withdraw from NAFTA once, they said. They told the president that he had strong leverage to renegotiate the trade deal but that once he publicly signaled his intent to leave, the situation would become so politically fraught for Canada and Mexico that they would not be able to return to negotiations, even if they wanted to. In the Oval Office interview, however, Trump repeatedly insisted that he was ready to pull out of NAFTA. At one point, he turned to Kushner, who was standing near his desk, and asked, "Was I ready to terminate NAFTA?" "Yeah," Kushner said, before explaining the case he made to the president: "I said, 'Look, there's plusses and minuses to doing it,' and either way he would have ended up in a good place." Perdue, the agriculture secretary, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also cautioned Trump against moving ahead, while two of the White House's populists, trade adviser Peter Navarro and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, urged him to stay the course, announcing his intention to withdraw in a splashy prime-time rally Saturday night in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The administration also received pressure from hundreds of business executives from around the country, many of whom called the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, asking what was going to happen, before calling the White House directly, urging Trump not to sign the order. Tom Donohue, the chamber's chief executive, also relayed the message to senior White House officials. The complaints pouring in from agriculture groups were even more apoplectic, warning White House officials that withdrawing from NAFTA could devastate the U.S. agriculture industry, allowing Mexico to reinstate high tariffs against U.S. exports. The Mexican government, meanwhile, had "several" contacts with its Canadian counterparts throughout the day Wednesday to share reactions and map out a joint strategy, including separate phone calls between their countries' leaders and Trump that evening. "We had the same position," said Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray on Thursday in an interview on Mexican television. Trump publicly claimed Thursday that his phone calls with Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau persuaded him to give negotiations a chance. But a senior administration official said Trump had already decided to hold off on signing the NAFTA termination letter before his phone calls with Mexico and Canada. In the interview, Trump recounted his internal deliberations: "In one way, I like the termination. In the other way, I like them - a lot, both of them. We have a very good relationship. And it's very hard when you have a relationship, it's very much something that would not be a nice act. It would not be exactly a friendly act." But, the president added, he reserves the right to change his mind. "I can always terminate," Trump said. "They called me up, they said, 'Could we try negotiating?' I said, 'Absolutely, yes.' If we can't come to a satisfactory conclusion, we'll terminate NAFTA."

A few doors from the Oval Office, Bannon works out of what he calls "the war room," a West Wing hideaway adjoining the chief of staff's spacious suite, from which Karl Rove and David Axelrod once worked. Upon moving in, Bannon cleared out most of the furniture, save for a standing desk and chairs, and plastered the walls with lists of Trump's campaign promises - scores, even hundreds of them, with green check marks or giant red X's over those that have been met. A list of 10 major pieces of legislation that Trump promised in his "Contract with Voters" hangs from near the ceiling down to the floor. None is crossed out yet. On Wednesday evening, around the time Trump was talking with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, one whiteboard contained an ominous marking: "NAFTA" and "April 29." It underscored Bannon's hope that on Saturday night, Trump would sign the paperwork initiating the withdrawal from NAFTA. Indeed, that same whiteboard contained other trade-specific actions, many boasting already checked-off promises. Withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Check. Action on the aluminum and steel industries? Check and check. One of the few unfulfilled, so far, was NAFTA. The Washington Post's Robert Costa and Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump said he has told the leaders of Mexico and Canada that he will not pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement at this time, but could still withdraw if he concludes a renegotiated pact is not "a fair deal for all." Trump tweeted early Thursday that he has agreed to remain a partner in the much-discussed trade agreement in calls he received from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House released a statement late Wednesday saying only that Trump had assured the two leaders in phone conversations that the U.S. would not withdraw from NAFTA at this time. In his Twitter post, Trump called America's relationships with the two hemispheric neighbors "very good" and said the prospects of a renegotiated deal are "very possible." But he also said that his consent to remaining in NAFTA for now is "subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA." Speaking to reporters Thursday before a White House meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, Trump that he'd been planning to "terminate NAFTA as of two or three days from now," but had been persuaded to reconsider, which he acknowledged "would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system." Trump added, "Now, if I'm unable to make a fair deal, if I'm unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we're going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot." He later said renegotiation was "starting today." The statement came hours after administration officials said Trump was considering a draft executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the deal — though administration officials cautioned it was just one of a number of options being discussed by the president and his staff. The White House launched a rhetorical fusillade against its close ally and neighbor Tuesday, accusing Canada of "rough" trade practices that have hurt American workers and farmers.

The anti-Canada invective - reinforced by U.S. announcements of sweeping tariffs on Canadian lumber imports - has... Some saw the threat as posturing by Trump to gain leverage over Mexico and Canada as he tries to negotiate changes to the deal. Trump railed against the decades-old trade deal during his campaign, describing it as a "disaster." Senior White House officials had spent recent days discussing steps that could be taken to start the process of renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA before the end of Trump's first 100 days in office, according to a person familiar with the president's thinking. But the person, along with an administration official, said a number of options remained on the table, and stressed discussions are ongoing about the best way to proceed. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on the order, which was first reported by Politico. "The president has made addressing the problems of NAFTA a priority throughout the campaign, and once the president makes a decision about how he wants to address that, we'll let you know," he said.

On Twitter Tuesday morning, Trump said that "Canada has made business for our dairy... The administration appeared divided Wednesday over how and when to proceed, as officials balanced a newfound cautiousness with the desire to rack up accomplishments before Trump's 100th day on the job. Some were gunning for Trump to sign a draft order this week, while others were weighing complications surrounding withdrawing from or renegotiating the deal without Congress fully on board. The debate played out in the media Wednesday as some outlets quoted officials insisting the signing was imminent, while other officials dismissed the reports as "just a rumor." "My practice is to comment on things we've actually done or are doing as opposed to commenting on rumors," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters at an unrelated White House briefing Wednesday evening. Trump could withdraw from NAFTA — but he would have to give six months' notice. And it is unclear what would happen next. The law Congress passed to enact the trade pact might remain in place, forcing Trump to wrangle with lawmakers and raising questions about the president's authority to raise tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports. The moves came days after the administration announced it would slap hefty tariffs on softwood lumber being imported from Canada. Trump has also been railing against changes in Canadian milk product pricing that he says are hurting the American dairy industry. Trump told The Associated Press in an interview last week that he planned to either renegotiate or terminate NAFTA, which he and other critics blame for wiping out U.S. manufacturing jobs because it allowed companies to move factories to Mexico to take advantage of low-wage labor. "I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico," he said. Another senior White House official declined to comment on "rumors" of specific actions. But that official said NAFTA has been a top priority for the president since Day One and said the administration has been working on it since taking office. That person also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's thinking. The Trump administration last month submitted a vague set of guidelines to Congress for renegotiating NAFTA, disappointing those who were expecting Trump to demand a major overhaul.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday evening its website would be "undergoing changes" to better represent the new direction the agency is taking, triggering the removal of several agency websites containing detailed climate data and scientific information. One of the websites that appeared to be gone had been cited to challenge statements made by the EPA's new administrator, Scott Pruitt. Another provided detailed information on the previous administration's Clean Power Plan, including fact sheets about greenhouse gas emissions on the state and local levels and how different demographic groups were affected by such emissions. The changes came less than 24 hours before thousands of protesters were set to march in Washington and around the country in support of political action to push back against the Trump administration's rollbacks of former president Barack Obama's climate policies. "As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land, and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency," J.P. Freire, the agency's associate administrator for public affairs, said in a statement. "We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we're protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law." The agency also said it would carefully archive pages from the past administration. Yet the website overhaul appears to include not only policy-related changes, but also scrutiny of a scientific Web page that has existed for nearly two decades, and that explained what climate change is and how it worked. The EPA's extensive climate change website now redirects to a page that says "this page is being updated" and that "we are currently updating our website to reflect EPA's priorities under the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Pruitt." It also links to a full archive of how the page used to look on Jan. 19, before Trump's inauguration. The archive notes, in a key section under the "causes of climate change," that Recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. It is this language, when the site was still up, that directly contradicted Pruitt. Pruitt had argued on CNBC last month that "measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." Most employees at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shy away from the public spotlight, focusing instead on the behind-the-scenes work of enforcing laws intended to protect public health and wildlife.

Most employees at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shy away from the public spotlight, focusing instead on the behind-the-scenes work of enforcing laws intended to protect public health and wildlife. Then Donald Trump became president. Even before Trump introduced a budget last month that... The EPA's climate change website stated otherwise, and did so by citing findings of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There had been reports early in the Trump administration that the EPA climate change website was set to be taken down, but in the end it did not happen immediately. The page contains scientific explanations of climate change and its causes and consequences, and has existed in one form or another since the Clinton administration. At that time it was called the agency's Global Warming site. The site has long served an informational role and sought to provide a comprehensive review of basic climate science, the effects of climate change, and how it is affecting the United States. In addition it contained information about the agency's approach to climate change and how people could take steps to lower their own contributions to climate change. However, the site has run into political difficulties before. Under President George W. Bush, updates to the site were frozen and then required to undergo White House review. However, this process did not lead to substantive changes in scientific content. In its press statement, the EPA said that when it comes to website changes, "the first page to be updated is a page reflecting President Trump's Executive Order on Energy Independence, which calls for a review of the so-called Clean Power Plan." That site, www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan, now redirects to https://www.epa.gov/Energy-Independence, which features an image of President Trump signing an executive order aimed at dismantling the power plant rule and other Obama-era climate regulations. In the statement, Freire said that "language associated with the Clean Power Plan, written by the last administration, is out-of-date. Similarly, content related to climate and regulation is also under review." In a Trump administration beset by lost opportunities, muddled strategies and frequent missteps in its first 100 days, one area stands out for its disciplined approach and early successes: the multi-front assault on environmental regulations. Unlike the Obamacare repeal debacle or immigration actions... In a Trump administration beset by lost opportunities, muddled strategies and frequent missteps in its first 100 days, one area stands out for its disciplined approach and early successes: the multi-front assault on environmental regulations. Unlike the Obamacare repeal debacle or immigration actions... Several career EPA employees, who asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution, said they were not briefed in advance about the decision to alter the agency's site. "People are obviously unhappy," one employee said. "It is, in my opinion, the best climate education website out there." David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program for the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, tweeted Friday, "Cleansing has begun. EPA website scrubbed of pages on "so-called" Clean Power Plan. Now only alternative facts." Another EPA website, documenting climate change "indicators" across the United States, remained up on Friday.

A Washington lobbying firm that worked under the direction of Paul Manafort's firm registered Friday with the Justice Department as a foreign agent — the same day a spokesman for Manafort backed off his previous statement that Manafort had decided to register. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, said he was wrong when he told The Associated Press earlier this month that Manafort would register with the Justice Department. Maloni said Manafort, who served as President Donald Trump's campaign chairman, is still considering his options after receiving guidance from the federal authorities about formally disclosing his efforts to influence U.S. policy and public opinion on behalf of a foreign client. As of Friday, two of the lobbying firms involved in the influence campaign on behalf of Ukrainian interests have acknowledged that their work should have been disclosed to the Justice Department. The AP reported in August that Manafort's consulting firm covertly orchestrated the lobbying and public opinion operation on behalf of a pro-Russian political party, the Ukrainian Party of Regions, and its leader, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The latest registration came Friday from Mercury LLC, which disclosed that Manafort was involved in its lobbying work, attending meetings with Mercury managing partner Vin Weber. Weber had previously told the AP that Manafort played no role in Mercury's work. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said Wednesday.

President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said Wednesday. Manafort is the second... In a statement to the AP, Maloni downplayed Manafort's involvement as it was detailed in Mercury's filing. "One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two-year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans," Maloni said, referring to a meeting Manafort had with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif, who later opposed a 2014 aid package to the government that replaced Yanukovych's. That Rohrabacher meeting was one of four attended by Manafort which were detailed in the filing. Mercury partner Mike McKeon denied that his firm had taken direction from Manafort's firm, DMP International. He said that, in addition to setting up lobbying meetings on behalf of Ukrainian government officials, Mercury had also worked with other Ukrainian political interests. "We work for and under the direction of the Centre, no one else," McKeon wrote in an email to the AP. But emails obtained by the AP last August show that Manafort's firm and his deputy Rick Gates, also a Trump campaign aide, directed Mercury's efforts on specific lobbying tasks. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. The emails show Gates directing Mercury lobbyists to set up meetings between a top Ukrainian official and senators and congressmen on influential committees involving Ukrainian interests. Gates had the firms gather information in the U.S. on a rival lobbying operation and directed efforts to undercut sympathy for Yulia Tymoshenko, an imprisoned rival of Yanukovych. Mercury had announced earlier this month that it would register for the work as a foreign agent after another lobbying firm, The Podesta Group, did so. The Podesta Group acknowledged its work could have benefited the Ukrainian government and should have been disclosed to the government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Mercury's filing says it does not know who ultimately was behind the European Centre, though the group was initially set up in Brussels with members of the Party of Regions on its board. In its retroactive registration Friday, Mercury said it has "no direct knowledge" of what people or entities funded the Centre, but said Mercury's goal was to help Ukraine build closer ties with the European Union. Throughout 2013, the firm also set up "educational events" and meetings that featured Ukrainian government officials and other experts on Ukraine and the EU. It is not clear from the documents whether Mercury's experts were also paid. Among the firm's listed experts were Alfred Gusenbauer, Austria's former chancellor, and Romano Prodi, Italy's former prime minister. The firm said it also arranged meetings with legislators and congressional staffers as well as think tanks and the media. Associated Press writer Jack Gillum contributed to this report.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is proposing to eliminate 2,300 jobs as part of a plan to cut more than a quarter of the State Department's budget for the next fiscal year, officials said Friday. The plan will almost certainly meet resistance from lawmakers opposing President Donald Trump's proposal to shrink the size of the federal government. Tillerson's proposal reduces the number of new diplomats being hired and includes the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development's possible consolidation, according to officials briefed on the proposal. The staff cuts would amount to about 3 percent of the department's roughly 75,000-strong workforce. The proposal is a response to the Office of Management and Budget's call to slash the State Department and USAID budgets by 31 percent through deep cuts to foreign aid and other programs, said the officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly about the as-yet unreleased plan and requested anonymity. Tillerson's plan would entail a 26 percent budget reduction, they said. In an interview with NPR that aired Friday, Tillerson said he intended to reorganize the department to make it more efficient and focused. "What we really want to do is examine the process by which the men and women — the career foreign service people, the civil servants, our embassies — how they deliver on that mission," he said. "We want to hear from them, we're just about to embark on a department-wide listening mission," he said, adding later: "I look forward to hearing their ideas. Because I know there's going to be opportunities to allow them to be more effective. Now, out of that we'll determine what the State Department looks like."

A North Korean mid-range ballistic missile apparently failed shortly after launch Saturday, South Korea and the United States said, the third test-fire flop just this month but a clear message of defiance as a U.S. supercarrier conducts drills in nearby waters. North Korean ballistic missile tests... Cutting more than a quarter of State Department's current $50.1 billion budget would require dramatic reductions in programs and staffing, cuts that many in Congress and elsewhere oppose. Tillerson's proposal includes 700 job cuts through buyouts and 1,600 from attrition. The job cuts were first reported by Bloomberg. Buyouts would be offered first to staffers over the age of 50 with at least two decades of government service, the officials said. The State Department declined to comment on the job reductions, and officials cautioned that plans are tentative until the budget is submitted to Congress next month. But Tillerson has spoken publicly of the need to streamline the agency. He will outline plans to State Department staffers next week, officials said. Tillerson hasn't addressed State Department workers since his first day on the job in February. As part of the plan, a high-level panel will explore the consolidation of USAID into the State Department this summer, officials said. An outside consultant will be brought in to survey staffers about additional areas where savings might be found. The officials briefed on Tillerson's proposal this week said the plan also calls for cutting back on hiring new diplomats, from as many as five classes of incoming foreign service officers per year to one or two. It also envisions less hiring of civil service employees, who comprise about 15 percent of the department's workforce. Numerous members of Congress as well as current and former senior military officers have said they are opposed to massive cuts to the diplomatic budget, which accounts for just over 1 percent of the total federal budget. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of 43 senators urged "robust funding" for the State Department and USAID. "At a time when we face multiple national security challenges around the world, deep cuts in this area would be shortsighted, counterproductive and even dangerous," they said in a letter to Senate appropriators.

President Donald Trump praised the "outstanding" trade relationship between the United States and Canada Monday, saying he would only be "tweaking" it going forward. The comments were received positively by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who came to the United States seeking to ensure Canada was not crippled as Trump re-negotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement. The neighboring leaders, polar opposites in nearly every way, took up the thorny subjects of trade and immigration at their first face to face meeting Monday. "We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it," Trump told reporters of the trade relationship. "We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. It's a much less severe situation than what's taking place on the southern border." At a joint news conference after their meetings, the two emphasized their shared goals. Trump pledged to work with Canada "in pursuit of our many shared interests." Trudeau spoke of a special bond and the "deep abiding respect" between the two countries, though he also said that "relationships between neighbors are pretty complex." President Donald Trump threatened in a phone call with his Mexican counterpart to send U.S. troops to stop "bad hombres down there" unless the Mexican military does more to control them, according to an excerpt of a transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press. The excerpt of...

The excerpt of... While the two leaders stressed shared interests, their contrasting views were also on display. Responding to questions from reporters, Trump defended his refugee and immigration orders, saying that "we cannot let the wrong people in." Trudeau, on the other hand, said Canada continues to "pursue our policies of openness." Trudeau later noted that there have been times when the two countries "have differed in our approaches." But he said "the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they chose to govern themselves." On trade, Trump said he would be "tweaking" the relationship with Canada, but said "it's a much less severe situation than what's happening on the southern border." He also noted the "outstanding trade relationship with Canada." Those were likely welcome comments for Canadians concerned that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump greeted Trudeau with a firm handshake as he arrived at the White House on a blustery morning. The two posed silently before reporters, until Trump suggested they shake hands for the cameras. Trudeau did bring a personal gift — a photo of Trump with Trudeau's father, the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Trump said he knew and respected Pierre Trudeau and would keep the photo in a "very special place." At a roundtable discussion with female executives from the United States and Canada, Trump and Trudeau announced a task force focused on women in the workforce. Trump said it was important to ensure the economy is a place where "women can work and thrive." Trudeau stressed that women have had to overcome barriers to succeed in business. The U.S. dealmaker who negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement said Donald Trump shouldn't destroy the pact, but expand it to embrace more industries. Trump can score a victory for America by opening up opportunities in the energy industry, which was largely kept out of NAFTA talks in... The U.S. dealmaker who negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement said Donald Trump shouldn't destroy the pact, but expand it to embrace more industries. Trump can score a victory for America by opening up opportunities in the energy industry, which was largely kept out of NAFTA talks in... Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump was in attendance at the meeting and helped recruit participants and set the agenda. The high-profile meeting is evidence of her rising policy influence. Trudeau, age 45, and Trump, age 70, have vastly different outlooks of the world. Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees. Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests. Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter on women in business could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. A Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan. "It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this," said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. "It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women." Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not shut out economically. "The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border," Paris said. Trudeau has been preparing for the Trump meeting for months. He will also meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill. Associated Press

Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross singled out changes to the nation's free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday as "the first thing" he would address if confirmed to lead the Commerce Department in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Speaking before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ross argued that the United States should open its economic borders to countries that "play by the rules." But those that do not, he said, "should be punished - severely." "I am not anti-trade. I am pro trade," Ross said. "But I am pro sensible trade, not pro trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community." Several of Trump's Cabinet nominees are facing potentially bruising confirmation battles. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., who is under consideration to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has been embroiled in controversy over his ownership of healthcare stocks while crafting legislation that could have affected those businesses. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, the nominee to lead the White House budget office, failed to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in the early 2000s related to a worker hired to help care for his newborn triplets, according to federal disclosures. Cabinet nominees must undergo routine vetting and disclose their financial holdings as part of their confirmation process. During Wednesday's hearing, Ross acknowledged that one of his household employees recently was not able to provide proof of legal residency. Ross said the person had presented a valid Social Security card and driver's license at the time of hiring in 2009. A Commerce committee aide said the employee said the only driver's license the employee could recently produce had expired. As president, Donald Trump won't be able to punish General Motors for building cars in Mexico without violating NAFTA. That may not stop him from taking an unprecedented step against an American company. Trade experts agree that presidents have wide latitude to impose penalties on imports, at least... As president, Donald Trump won't be able to punish General Motors for building cars in Mexico without violating NAFTA. That may not stop him from taking an unprecedented step against an American company. Trade experts agree that presidents have wide latitude to impose penalties on imports, at least... On Wednesday, Ross said the employee has been fired. He also said he paid all taxes required under that person's employment. Still, Ross appeared to face an easy path to confirmation, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle praising his testimony Wednesday. Commerce Chairman Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., called Ross's stance on trade "reassuring" even though it broke with Republican's free-trade orthodoxy. Ranking Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Ross's answers were "detailed" and "non-evasive" and called the hearing "a piece of cake." Trump made renegotiating trade agreements a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, tapping into the frustration of many middle-class workers who have felt left behind by globalization. Since his election, Trump has already begun wielding the power of the bully pulpit, repeatedly calling for a border tax on U.S. companies that offshore jobs and sell their products back home. He has taken to task individual companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota for investing in Mexico, sending their stock prices plummeting. But he has touted new U.S. jobs created by telecom giant Sprint and pharmaceutical maker Bayer AG. Ross was a close adviser to Trump during the election campaign, and he is slated to take the leading role in setting trade policy in the new administration. Trump has named economist Peter Navarro to head a new manufacturing council within the White House and picked trade veteran Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative, in charge of negotiating agreements. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a blanket 35 percent tax on Mexican imports and a 45 percent tariff on goods from China. In a recent interview with the German newspaper Bild, he also suggested imposing a 35 percent tax on German cars sold in the United States. "When you start out with the adverse party understanding that he or she is going to have to make concessions, that's a pretty good background to begin" negotiations, Ross said Wednesday. It is unclear if those measures are part of the border tax that Trump has pushed, and international trade experts say they are likely a violation of long-standing treaties. In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Trump criticized a tax plan by House Republicans intended to discourage imports known as "border adjustment." Ross indicated Wednesday that tariffs were an essential component of U.S. trade policy. However, he acknowledged that protectionist measures implemented during the Great Depression only served to deepen the nation's economic distress. "I think tariffs play a role both as a negotiating tool and to punish offenders that don't play by the rules," he said. Trump's top trade advisers have also raised concerns about China's growing power in the world economy. Navarro has been particularly dire in his warnings, writing a book entitled "Death By China." Ross, who collects Chinese art and has extensive business interests in the country, sounded a stern but less strident tone in his testimony Wednesday. He said companies manipulate their currencies as a strategy for "attacking" the American economy, though he did not mention Trump's pledge to label China a currency manipulator on the president-elect's first day in office. "China is the most protectionist country of very large countries," Ross said. Ross amassed his fortune by investing in the industries that were hit hardest by the forces of globalization -- including steel, coal and textile. He recently announced he would step down down from his position on the board of directors at ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, in advance of his confirmation. According to Bloomberg, Ross's financial disclosures revealed assets of more than $330 million, with his net worth estimated at $2.9 billion. During his testimony, Ross said he would be "scrupulous in recusal" to prevent any conflicts of interest with his vast business empire. But he said his wide-ranging investments also provided him insight into the minutiae of trade law and said his companies have been the victims of unfair practices. On Wednesday, he called for tougher enforcement of U.S. trade laws, arguing that countries often delay cases by failing to provide paperwork and that billions of dollars in penalties go uncollected. That hard-line stance has helped him win support from the United Steelworkers, which had backed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton during the election. Ross's testimony was briefly interrupted by protesters criticizing him for his early support of the sweeping trade agreement with Asia known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of President Barack Obama's signature achievements. The deal has since become politically toxic, and Trump has vowed to pull out of the agreement once in office. Ross said Wednesday that he changed his mind after analyzing the details of the agreement, raising concerns about what he said were lax requirements on auto parts manufacturing. "I came across some things that I felt were not consistent with things that had been advertised," he said. Ross also highlighted proposals to encourage domestic growth, including spending on infrastructure. During the campaign, Ross and Navarro suggested a $137 billion tax credit that they said could spur $1 trillion in private-sector spending on infrastructure projects with a regular revenue stream, such as toll roads. That proposal was widely panned by economists as unrealistic, but Ross defended it on Wednesday. Ross said the tax credits should be one of several efforts by the federal government to boost infrastructure spending. Several top Republican lawmakers have questioned the need for additional government spending, however, and Ross did not propose a way to pay for those proposals. "The infrastructure needs of this country are so monumental that we need any available source of capital in order to meet it on a timely basis," he said.

The U.S. State Department has removed its promotional posting about President Donald Trump's Florida resort, after a storm of ethics criticism Monday. In an April 4 blog post that was republished by several U.S. embassies abroad, Mar-a-Lago was described as "Trump's Florida estate," where he has hosted foreign leaders. "By visiting this 'winter White House,' Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lago's original owner and designer," the post said. Left unsaid: Mar-a-Lago is part of Trump's business empire. After his election, the resort doubled its membership fee to $200,000. As president, Trump has visited the property seven times, and its restaurant fills up when he's in town. The State Department said late Monday that its intention was "to inform the public about where the president has been hosting world leaders" and that it regrets "any misperception." That statement now appears in place of the original blog post. The White House did not respond to questions about whether it had any involvement in the original posting or the decision to take it down. The post originated on "Share America," a State Department project. Its website describes its mission as "sharing compelling stories and images that spark discussion and debate on important topics like democracy, freedom of expression, innovation, entrepreneurship, education, and the role of civil society." Florida restaurant inspectors recently found more than a dozen violations in the kitchen at President Donald Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago.

Florida restaurant inspectors recently found more than a dozen violations in the kitchen at President Donald Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago. Inspectors from the Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation cited at least 13 violations in reports from a January 26 inspection at Trump's... Other topics on the Share America page include a new U.S. coin honoring Frederick Douglass, debate over the Confederate flag and news about first lady Melania Trump's participation in the State Department's International Women of Courage award ceremony. The Mar-a-Lago post was nearly three weeks old but gained traction Monday when several people noticed the U.S. embassy to the United Kingdom was featuring it. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, asked on Twitter why taxpayers are "promoting the president's private country club" and referred to the incident as "kleptocratic." Norman Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's chief ethics attorney, said the promotion is "exploitation." Eisen compared it to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's promotion of Ivanka Trump's clothing business, for which she was "counseled" but not otherwise reprimanded by the White House. "This idea of using government for private gain is metastasizing," Eisen said. "It must be stopped." Question: "President Obama, when he was in office, he spent $33,000 a day for his expenses. . . .

On Twitter, Richard Painter, who served in an ethics role for President George W. Bush, called the State Department post "Use of public office for private gain pure and simple." Eisen, Painter and other attorneys have sued Trump, alleging violation of the "emoluments clause" of the U.S. Constitution. That provision says the president may not accept foreign gifts or payments without the consent of Congress. The Trump Organization argues that prohibition wasn't intended to cover fair-market exchanges. AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The White House on Wednesday acknowledged the AP's revelations had "started to catch a lot of buzz" but brushed them aside, though some members of Congress expressed alarm. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government." White House spokesman Sean Spicer indicated Wednesday that President Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska. "To suggest that the president knew who his clients were from 10 years ago is a bit insane," Spicer said. He noted the AP's reporting "has started to catch a lot of buzz" but said Manafort's work occurred long before he became Trump's campaign chairman. "I don't know what he got paid to do," Spicer said, adding, "There's no suggestion he did anything improper." Manafort's plans were laid out in detailed documents obtained by the AP that included strategy memoranda and records showing international wire transfers for millions of dollars. How much work Manafort performed under the contract was unclear. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests. New corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election. The allegations... New corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election. The allegations... Manafort confirmed again Wednesday in a statement that he had worked for Deripaska but denied his work had been pro-Russian in nature. He added, "I look forward to meeting with those conducting serious investigations of these issues." An official representative of Deripaska said simply in a statement Wednesday: "There was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr Deripaska which now is a subject to legal claims." The disclosures come as Trump campaign advisers are the subject of an FBI probe and two congressional investigations, and they appear to guarantee that Manafort will be sought as a key witness in upcoming hearings. Investigators are reviewing whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 campaign. Manafort has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated and misguided. The documents obtained by AP show Manafort's ties to Russia were closer than previously revealed. Paul Manafort, then-campaign chairman for Donald Trump, is interviewed on the floor of the Republican National Convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland in July 2016. Paul Manafort, then-campaign chairman for Donald Trump, is interviewed on the floor of the Republican National Convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland in July 2016. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the disclosures "serious stuff" and more evidence that an independent congressional committee should investigate the Trump administration. "Other shoes will drop," he said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic, said of Manafort: "Clearly, if he's getting millions of dollars from a billionaire close to Putin, to basically undermine democratic movements, that's something I'd want to know about. I doubt if Trump knew about it." Democrats on the House intelligence committee said the new revelations will feature in their investigations. The disclosure "undermines the groundless assertions that the administration has been making that there are no ties between President Trump and Russia. This is not a drip, drip, drip," said Rep. Jackie Speier of California. "This is now dam-breaking with water flushing out with all kinds of entanglements." Deripaska became one of Russia's wealthiest men under Putin, buying assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin's interests. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described him as "among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis" and "a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad." In response to questions about Manafort's consulting firm, a spokesman for Deripaska in 2008 — at least three years after they began working together — said Deripaska had never hired the firm. Another Deripaska spokesman in Moscow last week declined to answer AP's questions. Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman last year from March until August, a period that included the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump in July. Trump asked Manafort to resign after AP revealed that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's ruling pro-Russian political party. The newly obtained business records link Manafort more directly to Putin's interests in the region. According to those records and people with direct knowledge of Manafort's work for Deripaska, Manafort made plans to open an office in Moscow, and at least some of his work in Ukraine was directed by Deripaska, not local political interests there. The Moscow office never opened. Manafort has been a leading focus of the U.S. intelligence investigation of Trump's associates and Russia, according to a U.S. official. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation are confidential. Meanwhile, federal criminal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014. No U.S. criminal charges have ever been filed in the case. FBI Director James Comey, in confirming to Congress the federal intelligence investigation this week, declined to say whether Manafort was a target. Manafort's name was mentioned 28 times during the hearing of the House intelligence committee, mostly about his work in Ukraine. No one mentioned Deripaska. On Monday, Spicer had said Manafort "played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time" in the presidential campaign, even though he was Trump's campaign chairman. Spicer on Wednesday said further that Manafort was hired to oversee the campaign's delegate operation. "To be clear, he got the job done on the delegates," Spicer said. Manafort and his associates remain in Trump's orbit. Manafort told a colleague this year that he continues to speak with Trump by telephone. Manafort's former business partner in eastern Europe, Rick Gates, has been seen inside the White House on a number of occasions, helped plan Trump's inauguration and now runs a nonprofit organization, America First Policies, to back the White House agenda. Gates, whose name does not appear in the documents, told the AP that he joined Manafort's firm in 2006 and was aware Manafort had a relationship with Deripaska but was not aware of the work described in the memos. Gates said his work was focused on domestic U.S. lobbying and political consulting in Ukraine at the time. He said he stopped working for Manafort's firm in March 2016 when he joined Trump's presidential campaign. Manafort told Deripaska in 2005 that he was pushing policies as part of his work in Ukraine "at the highest levels of the U.S. government — the White House, Capitol Hill and the State Department," according to the documents. He also said he had hired a "leading international law firm with close ties to President Bush to support our client's interests," but he did not identify the firm. Manafort also said he was employing unidentified legal experts for the effort at leading universities and think tanks, including Duke University, New York University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political leaders or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the department. Willfully failing to register is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though the government rarely files criminal charges. "I don't know if he violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act," Sen. Graham said, "but it's something I think we all need to know more about." Deripaska owns Basic Element Co., which employs 200,000 people worldwide in the agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, financial services, insurance and manufacturing industries, and he runs one of the world's largest aluminum companies. Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.2 billion. How much Deripaska paid Manafort in total is not clear, but people familiar with the relationship said money transfers to Manafort amounted to tens of millions of dollars and continued through at least 2009. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secret payments publicly. In strategy memos, Manafort proposed that Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine. He proposed building "long term relationships" with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region. Manafort proposed extending his existing work in eastern Europe to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Georgia, where he pledged to bolster the legitimacy of governments friendly to Putin and undercut anti-Russian figures through political campaigns, nonprofit front groups and media operations. For the $10 million annual contract, Manafort did not use his public-facing consulting firm, Davis Manafort. Instead, he used a company, LOAV Ltd., that he had registered in Delaware in 1992. He listed LOAV as having the same address as his lobbying and consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. In other records, LOAV's address was listed as Manafort's home, also in Alexandria. Manafort sold the home in July 2015 for $1.4 million. He now owns an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, as well as other properties in Florida and New York. One strategy memo to Deripaska was written by Manafort and Rick Davis, his business partner at the time. In written responses to the AP, Davis said he did not know that his firm had proposed a plan to covertly promote the interests of the Russian government. Davis said he believes Manafort used his name without his permission on the strategy memo. "My name was on every piece of stationery used by the company and in every memo prior to 2006. It does not mean I had anything to do with the memo described," Davis said. He took a leave of absence from the firm in late 2006 to work on Sen. McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Manafort's work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court. The billionaire gave Manafort nearly $19 million to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska's representatives. It said that after taking the money, Manafort and his associates stopped responding to Deripaska's queries about how the funds had been used. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska's representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the nomination, Deripaska's representatives said they would no longer discuss the case.

The U.S. government investigation of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, crossed the Atlantic earlier this year to the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus, once known as a haven for money laundering by Russian billionaires. Treasury agents in recent months obtained information connected to Manafort's transactions from Cypriot authorities, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The request was part of a federal anti-corruption probe into Manafort's work in Eastern Europe. The Cyprus attorney general, one of the country's top law enforcement officers, was also aware of the American request. Manafort was Trump's unpaid campaign chairman from March until August last year, during the critical run-up to the Republican National Convention. He's been a leading focus of the U.S. investigation into whether Trump associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 presidential campaign. A spokesman for Manafort has not responded to questions from the AP since Wednesday. Federal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukrainian assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014. No U.S. criminal charges have been filed in the case. It was not immediately clear what time period of Manafort's transactions was covered under the request from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Manafort was known to route financial transactions through Cyprus, according to records of international wire transfers obtained by the AP and public court documents filed in a 2014 legal dispute in the Cayman Islands with Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. As part of their investigation, U.S. officials were expected to look into millions of dollars' worth of wire transfers to Manafort. In one case, the AP found that a Manafort-linked company received a $1 million payment in October 2009 from a mysterious firm through the Bank of Cyprus. The $1 million left the account the same day — split in two, roughly $500,000 disbursements to accounts with no obvious owner. There is nothing inherently illicit about using multiple companies as Manafort was doing. But it was unclear why he would have been involved with companies in Cyprus, known for its history of money laundering before joining the European Union, with unclear sources of the money flowing in to them and with such secrecy surrounding the firms' connections to him. With Cyprus' entry into the European Union in 2004, the island was forced to put in place a host of stringent anti-money laundering regulations to avoid running afoul with the bloc's own rules and incurring the wrath of other EU members. Cypriot banks, sticking to EU rules, took on heightened importance when Cyprus started using the Euro currency in 2008. But the island's allure as a friendly EU member brought a steady stream of Russian cash to fill Cypriot bank coffers, and rumors began to swirl again that it was fast becoming a major cash laundromat for Russian oligarchs, a charge that Cypriot authorities strenuously deny. A Treasury Department spokesman, Stephen Hudak, declined to answer the AP's questions about Manafort's records, citing a policy never to confirm or deny an investigation's existence.

President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics,... Cypriot officials said further information would have to come to the agency through a formal request to the Cypriot Ministry of Justice and Public Order under a mutual legal assistance treaty. No request has been made, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case. This week, the AP revealed Manafort's secret work for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago. Manafort did not dispute working for Oleg Deripaska but said he had represented him only in personal and business matters. He called the focus on him a "smear campaign," and said he was ready to defend his work if investigators wish to learn more about it. The White House said Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort, who is 67, eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006. "The president was not aware of Paul's clients from the last decade," said spokesman Sean Spicer. "What else don't we know? I mean, where he went to school, what grades he got, who he played with in the sandbox?" Spicer declined to comment Thursday on the information about the offshore financial transactions. On the topic of Manafort in general, he reiterated to reporters at the day's press briefing: "You pull out a gentleman who was employed by someone for five months and talk about a client that he had 10 years ago." The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, was established in 1990 and became a Treasury Department bureau soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. It is part of an international network of so-called financial intelligence units that share information with each other in money laundering and terrorism financing investigations.

President Donald Trump threatened in a phone call with his Mexican counterpart to send U.S. troops to stop "bad hombres down there" unless the Mexican military does more to control them, according to an excerpt of a transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press. The excerpt of the call did not detail who exactly Trump considered "bad hombres," nor did it make clear the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's response. Mexico denies that Trump made the threat. Still, the excerpt offers a rare and striking look at how the new president is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. Trump's remarks suggest he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used to rally crowds on the campaign trail. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The Mexican Foreign Relations Department told The AP: "The negative statements you refer to did not occur during said telephone call. On the contrary, the tone was constructive." The phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between the new president and his ally. The two have had a series of public spats over Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refuses to agree to. "You have a bunch of bad hombres down there," Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt given to AP. "You aren't doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it." A person with access to the official transcript of the phone call provided only that portion of the conversation to The Associated Press. The person gave it on condition of anonymity because the administration did not make the details of the call public. It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief - a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America's staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead, President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee... It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief - a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America's staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead, President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee... The Mexican website Aristegui Noticias on Tuesday published a similar account of the phone call, based on the reporting of journalist Dolia Estevez. The report described Trump as humiliating Pena Nieto in a confrontational conversation. Mexico's foreign relations department denied that account, saying it "is based on absolute falsehoods." Americans may recognize Trump's signature bombast in the comments, but the remarks may carry more weight in Mexico. Political analyst and former presidential spokesman Ruben Aguilar notes Pena Nieto had enjoyed an apparent spike in his low approval levels, as Mexicans rallied around him for publicly challenging Trump in the border wall dispute. The latest remarks could undercut that, if Pena Nieto is viewed as "weak," he said. Trump has used the phrase "bad hombres" before. In an October presidential debate, he vowed to get rid the U.S. of "drug lords" and "bad people." "We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out," he said. The phrase ricocheted on social media with Trump opponents saying he was denigrating immigrants. Trump's comment was in line with the new administration's bullish stance on foreign policy matters in general, and the president's willingness to break long-standing norms around the globe. Before his inauguration, Trump spoke to the president of Taiwan, breaking long-standing U.S. policy and irritating China. His temporary ban on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, aimed at reviewing screening procedures to lessen the threat of extremist attacks, has caused consternation around the world. But nothing has created the level of bickering as the border wall, a centerpiece of his campaign. Mexico has consistently said it would not pay for the wall and opposes it. Before the phone call, Pena Nieto canceled a planned visit to the United States. The fresh fight with Mexico last week arose over trade as the White House proposed a 20 percent tax on imports from the key U.S. ally to finance the wall after Pena Nieto abruptly scrapped his Jan. 31 trip to Washington. The U.S. and Mexico conduct some $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade, and cooperate on everything from migration to anti-drug enforcement to major environmental issues. Trump tasked his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner — a real estate executive with no foreign policy experience — with managing the ongoing dispute, according to an administration official with knowledge of the call. At a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump described his call with Pena Nieto as "friendly." In a statement, the White House said the two leaders acknowledged their "clear and very public differences" and agreed to work through the immigration disagreement as part of broader discussions on the relationship between their countries.

White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is under increasing political pressure and risks losing the confidence of some colleagues following reports that he misled senior administration officials about his discussion of sanctions with a Russian envoy shortly before President Trump took office. As White House aides scramble to get their stories straight about the exact nature of those communications and as Democrats call for Flynn's security clearance to be suspended or revoked, neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or signaled that he has the president's confidence. Privately, some administration officials said that Flynn's position has weakened and support for him has eroded largely because of a belief that he was disingenuous about Russia and therefore could not be fully trusted going forward. "The knives are out for Flynn," said one administration official who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. On Sunday, the top White House aide dispatched to represent the administration on the political talk shows pointedly declined to defend Flynn. Asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" whether the president had confidence in Flynn, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said he did not know. "It's not for me to tell you what's in the president's mind," Miller told moderator Chuck Todd. He added that his colleagues at the White House "did not give me anything to say" about Flynn. When ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Miller about Flynn's interactions with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, Miller said, "I don't have any news to make . . . today on this point." The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn - national security adviser to then-President-elect Donald Trump - but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian... The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn - national security adviser to then-President-elect Donald Trump - but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian... The Washington Post revealed last week that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in the month before Trump's inauguration. The Post's finding, confirmed by nine current and former U.S. officials, contrasted with the assurances made publicly by Vice President Pence and other top administration officials that Flynn never talked about sanctions with Russian officials. Based on Flynn's private assurances, Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House press secretary Sean Spicer stated publicly that Flynn never discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Pence spoke to Flynn twice on Friday - once face to face and by telephone, according to an administration official who declined to characterize the contents of those discussions. "Flynn is running out of friends, no question," a different administration official said. "The broad consensus in the White House is that he lied. The vice president feels like he lied. In a position that needs to be no drama, it's nonstop drama. I would be very surprised if he lasts much longer." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, R, an informal adviser to Trump, called on Flynn to "clear up" what happened with Trump and Pence, but he stopped short of accusing him of wrongdoing. "I think that's the obligation of General Flynn, his national security adviser, to have those type of candid conversations with the president and the vice president," Christie said on CNN. "And then they will act as they see fit, given all the circumstances." Over the weekend at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, the president privately voiced frustration with Flynn and the political baggage he is hanging on the White House, according to two people familiar with his comments. Spicer denied that Trump criticized Flynn to anyone at the club and called assertions to the contrary "fake news." People close to Flynn said he feels confident in his position despite the swirling controversy. He flew to Florida this weekend with the president along with other National Security Council officials to engage with his Japanese counterparts during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit. Furthermore, people in Trump's orbit cautioned that it would not be in the president's nature to fire Flynn because doing so would amount to an admission of guilt and misjudgment in the face of media scrutiny, as well as demonstrate chaos in the early weeks of his presidency. The doubts about the national security adviser come as Trump faces his first significant provocation from a U.S. adversary overseas. North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the weekend, a move suspected by some experts as designed to serve as a test of components of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. Trump responded on Saturday night in a joint appearance with Abe at Mar-a-Lago, where he reassured his Japanese counterpart that the United States fully supported Japan. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and a decorated intelligence officer, met Trump in late 2015 to offer advice about his campaign and signed on with Trump the following year. He won Trump's approval during the general election with his willingness to travel regularly and deliver fiery stump speeches trashing Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Democratic leaders have called for investigations into the Flynn's contact with Russian officials and for Trump to suspend and revoke Flynn's security clearance. "President Trump's kowtowing to Vladimir Putin is endangering our national security and emboldening a dangerous tyrant," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Saturday. Rep. Elijah Cummings, Md., the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Sunday on ABC News that suspending Flynn's clearance would be "an appropriate action." Trump has not yet issued a comment about Flynn, either on Twitter or in one of his brief appearances before journalists over the weekend. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, reporters asked Trump about The Post's report on Flynn's discussion of sanctions and the president claimed he did not know about it, even though it had by then become a major story across cable news. "I don't know about that. I haven't seen it," Trump said during a flight to Florida from Washington. "What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll look into that." The Washington Post's Greg Miller contributed to this report.

One of President Donald Trump's longtime friends made a striking move on Sunday: After talking privately with the president over drinks late Friday, Christopher Ruddy publicly argued that Trump should replace his White House chief of staff. "A lot of people have been saying, 'Look, Donald has some problems,' and I think he realizes that he's got to make some changes going forward," Ruddy said in an interview with The Washington Post. Ruddy went on to detail his critique of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus: "It's my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff - and Donald trusted him - but it's pretty clear the guy is in way over his head. He's not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should've been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity." Ruddy insisted that he was speaking only for himself and not the president, and he would not reveal whether Trump had confided in him about Priebus because the conversation was private. White House spokesmen did not respond to a request for comment on Ruddy's statement. Early Sunday evening, Ruddy attempted to soften his criticism of the White House chief of staff, saying in a tweet that he had just spoken with Priebus. "Reince just briefed me on new WH plans. Impressive!," he tweeted. "Told him I have 'open mind' based on his results." Reince just briefed me on new WH plans. Impressive! CNN today my personal view. Told him I have 'open mind' based on his results. Ruddy - who is chief executive of Newsmax Media and a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida - spoke to The Post shortly after appearing on CNN, where he threw Priebus under the proverbial bus. The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called "judicial usurpation of power." White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller...

White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller... "I think there's a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff," Ruddy told anchor Brian Stelter in a live interview from Miami. "I think Reince Priebus (is a) good guy, well-intentioned, but he clearly doesn't know how the federal agencies work. He doesn't have a really good system. He doesn't know how the communications flow." Trump, Ruddy continued, is "not getting the backup he needs" from Priebus. Ruddy said he spent about 30 minutes talking privately with Trump late Friday at Mar-a-Lago after the president's dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, after Abe had retreated to his suite for the night. "Since the (CNN) show, I've gotten three text messages from sitting Cabinet members praising my appearance," Ruddy said. "They realize this whole government depends on this chief of staff." He declined to identify the Cabinet secretaries. Ruddy praised White House press secretary Sean Spicer and other administration officials who have come under public scrutiny. He said blame for missteps at the dawn of Trump's presidency should fall squarely on Priebus.

"He just doesn't have the gravitas that Donald would respect at the end of the day."

Question: "President Obama, when he was in office, he spent $33,000 a day for his expenses. . . . Our president now, at this time, his average is $3 million a day." Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla.: "It's costing him $60,000 a day when he comes down for extra care, but Palm Beach said they're going to put an extra tax for that. President Obama spent, what was it, $97 million in his eight years. . . . He went to Hawaii a lot. He went to Africa quite a bit. He went around the world. . . . He went to Africa, and he took their kids and friends and all that. Ninety-seven-million dollars in eight years, man."- Exchange during a town hall in Palatka, Fla., April 11, 2017 Question: "I heard you say earlier that you didn't care what Donald Trump did on the weekend and, frankly, neither do I. Except, he wants me to pay for it. . . . Does this concern you at all?" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.: "I wasn't critical of the last president or the president before that, for what they do in their off time. . . . I'm not going to tell the president where he can or cannot spend his weekends."- Exchange during a town hall in Mesa, Ariz., April 13, 2017 "I do wish that he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That's what we have the White House for."- Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, answer at town hall in Wall Lake, Iowa, April 18, 2017 --- President Donald Trump's travels to his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida are a frequent topic at town halls hosted by members of Congress during the April recess. We've been asking readers to send us fact-checkable claims from their town halls, and some readers flagged claims about the cost of Trump's trips. Flake and Ernst shared their opinions in response to constituents' questions. But Yoho's response involved claims that merit a fact check. Did Obama go to Africa "quite a bit" with his family and friends? How does the $97 million figure for Obama's travels compare with the $60,000-a-day figure for Trump's travels to Mar-a-Lago? U.S. President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport to spend Easter weekend at Mar-a-Lago resort on April 13, 2017 in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Trump has made numerous trips to his Florida home and according to reports has cost over an estimated $20 million in his first 80 days in office. U.S. President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport to spend Easter weekend at Mar-a-Lago resort on April 13, 2017 in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Trump has made numerous trips to his Florida home and according to reports has cost over an estimated $20 million in his first 80 days in office. --- Presidential travel costs are not readily made public, so at the moment we just have snapshots of the total price tag. As you can imagine, presidential trips require elaborate planning and security measures, and the main costs involve transportation and Secret Service detail. There were a lot of numbers in the exchange between the constituent and Yoho, so we'll explain each of them. Obama's $97 million over eight years: This is an estimate by the conservative group Judicial Watch, which tallied Secret Service and Air Force costs incurred during the former first family's personal travels. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the group tracked trips that were "political, leisurely or otherwise unnecessary," including vacations to Martha's Vineyard and travels during the 2016 campaign as Hillary Clinton's surrogates. Obama's $33,000 per day: This is $97 million, divided by eight years, divided by 365 days. Trump's $3 million per day: The constituent appears to be referring to a number floating on the Internet for Trump's cost per trip to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. The figure, $3.6 million to be exact, comes from an October 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report about Obama's February 2013 golf weekend to Palm Beach. But as the Associated Press found, the trips are not directly comparable. Obama's February 2013 trip included a stop in Chicago, where he gave a speech before going to Florida for his golf weekend. That stop added costs to the total estimate. Judicial Watch estimates Trump's Mar-a-Lago visits at closer to $1 million, when calculated just with the estimated costs for Air Force One and Secret Service. But there is no documented figure. Trump's $60,000 per day: Yoho is describing how much it costs Palm Beach County every day to pay for local law enforcement to work overtime when Trump visits Mar-a-Lago. As Yoho says, the county wants to levy a special tax on the resort to pay for the overtime security costs. That is only one piece of the total price of Trump's Mar-a-Lago visits, and it excludes Secret Service or Air Force costs. Moreover, some of Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago are "working" trips, where he conducts some official business, such as hosting foreign dignitaries at his golf club. That means they're not directly comparable to the purely leisurely trips tallied under Obama's $97 million. Fitton said some Mar-a-Lago trips can be justified and wouldn't necessarily indicate a misuse or abuse of presidential travel. "His [Obama's] vacations to Hawaii cost millions of dollars," Fitton said. "The political problem with President Trump, and the accountability problem, is after a period of time, the cost will be difficult for him to be able to defend. It doesn't help that we don't know what the [total] costs are because the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security [which oversees the Secret Service] haven't gotten their act together to turn them over to us." The Washington Post reported that the unusually lavish lifestyle of Trump and his family is pushing the rate of his travel costs beyond his predecessors', and "could balloon into the hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a four-year term." Did Obama go to Africa "quite a bit" with his friends and family? Not really. Obama took three trips to seven African countries. That's seven out of 58 countries he visited as president through both terms. President Bill Clinton visited 10 African countries, and George W. Bush visited 11. Bush visited once with his wife and two daughters, and another time just with his wife. Obama took his wife and daughters on his 2013 trip to three African countries, at an estimated price tag of tens of millions of dollars - possibly the most expensive of his tenure. The federal government provided all the resources, because the options in developing areas did not meet White House standards, The Post reported. That made the trip particularly costly. Clinton and Bush made similarly resource-intensive trips. Yoho's staff did not provide a response or comment, but we will update this fact check if we receive one. --- There was a lot of interest at recent town halls about Trump's travels to Mar-a-Lago, and how much they are costing taxpayers. Yoho, responding to a constituent with some inaccurate information, did not make an apples-to-apples comparison of Trump's and Obama's travels in the town hall. Yoho noted the daily cost of $60,000 for Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips, vs. Obama's $97 million in travel costs over eight years. But the $60,000 represents a fraction of the costs per trip; it's just the cost to the Palm Beach County government. Some of Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips involve official work, whereas the Obama family trips counted in the $97 million figure are ones that a conservative group deemed "political, leisurely or otherwise unnecessary" to taxpayers. So the two figures are not directly comparable. And while Obama's trips to Africa were costly (as were the Africa trips of Bush and Clinton), he didn't go "quite a bit" when you look at his Africa trips compared with the rest of his travels as president. We award Two Pinocchios to Yoho.

New corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election. The allegations were disclosed Tuesday at a news conference by a Ukrainian lawmaker who said he had obtained documents showing that Manafort had attempted to hide payments he had received from the party of Ukraine's former president, who is living in Russia and wanted on corruption charges in his home country. A spokesman for Manafort called the claims "baseless" and said some of the documents released Tuesday appeared to be fabricated because the letterhead and signatures did not match those belonging to Manafort. The spectacle in Kiev came just hours after FBI Director James Comey confirmed the existence of a federal probe into possible connections between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin. Paul Manafort served as campaign chairman for Donald Trump, taking primary control when campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired in June 2016. Paul Manafort served as campaign chairman for Donald Trump, taking primary control when campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired in June 2016. It also followed an apparent effort by the White House to distance Trump from the man who helped lead his campaign during five critical months into last summer, with White House press secretary Sean Spicer declaring Monday that Manafort had played a "limited role for a very limited amount of time" in the campaign. Manafort, 67, a longtime lobbyist and Republican strategist, was hired by the Trump campaign in March 2016, a time when Trump was winning primaries but feared he could still lose the nomination if his team failed to properly master arcane convention rules and wrangle votes from Republican delegates. In May, he was named the campaign's chairman. From the start, there was focus on Manafort's ties to pro-Russian figures, given Trump's repeated calls to forge closer relations to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia's emerging role over the summer in seeking to meddle in the U.S. election. U.S. intelligence officials have said that the Kremlin orchestrated the politically damaging hacks of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Manafort had done business with Putin-aligned business titans and worked in Ukraine for former president Viktor Yanukovych's political party starting in 2004. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014 amid violent street protests. The issue of Ukraine's relationship with Russia was a point of contention during the campaign, with Trump expressing openness to consider easing U.S. sanctions on Moscow that had been imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. On Monday, unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign, substantiated claims about Russia's meddling in the U.S. election to help Trump win, and cloudy claims about Trump associates' ties to Russia all came to a head. FBI Director... On Monday, unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign, substantiated claims about Russia's meddling in the U.S. election to help Trump win, and cloudy claims about Trump associates' ties to Russia all came to a head. FBI Director... Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign chairman in August, after the New York Times reported that his name appeared in a "black ledger" that showed he was paid $12.7 million in secret cash payments from Yanukovych's party. Manafort has denied receiving the payments and said he is the victim of political infighting in Ukraine. Now, Manafort has come under scrutiny in an FBI investigation into possible foreign corruption involving Ukrainian politics, according to people familiar with the matter. The Ukraine corruption investigation is related to the broader counterintelligence investigation into alleged contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials, these people said. But Manafort vehemently denies any involvement in the Russian efforts and has told people close to him that he is eager to testify before congressional committees investigating Moscow's intervention in the election. In a statement, Manafort said he was the victim of a "blatant attempt to discredit me and the legitimacy of the election of President Trump." "I had no role or involvement in the cyberattack on the DNC or the subsequent release of information gained from the attack, and I have never spoken with any Russian Government officials or anyone who claimed to have been involved in the attack," he said. "The suggestion that I ever worked in concert with anyone to release hacked emails or sought to undermine the interests of the United States is false. Despite the constant scrutiny and innuendo, there are no facts or evidence supporting these allegations, nor will there be." The new allegations against Manafort were leveled by Serhiy Leshchenko, a lawmaker and journalist, who on Tuesday released a copy of what he said was an invoice on letterhead from Manafort's consulting company, based in Alexandria, Virginia, dated Oct. 14, 2009, to a Belize-based company for $750,000 for the sale of 501 computers. On the same day, Manafort's name is listed next to a $750,000 entry in the "black ledger" released by anti-corruption investigators in August. The list was found at the party headquarters in the turmoil after Ukraine's 2014 revolution. Leshchenko alleged that Manafort falsified an invoice to the Belize company to legitimize the $750,000 payment to himself. Nazar Kholodnytskyi, a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine whose department specializes in corruption cases, said in an interview Tuesday that the documents hadn't been confirmed by law enforcement or, to his knowledge, submitted for examination. There is an ongoing investigation into the black ledgers, he said, but Manafort was not a target of that investigation. Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, said the new documents released Tuesday appear to be fabricated. "We have seen some of the new documents, and they are not Paul's letterhead or Paul's signature," he said. Maloni added that Leshchenko's claims should be "summarily dismissed." Leshchenko's name has emerged separately in a cache of more than 285,000 personal messages apparently stolen from the iPhone of Manafort's daughter, Andrea Manafort, 31, and dumped in February on a website used by cyberhackers. Maloni said Manafort has confirmed that his daughter's phone was hacked and that some of the texts are authentic, but he has declined to authenticate the entire cache. Maloni said Andrea Manafort declined to comment. The posted texts show Manafort had received a blackmail email purportedly from Leshchenko in August, threatening to release information about Manafort's work in Ukraine. Leshchenko has said he did not send the email. Maloni said Manafort did not know who was behind the threat but had turned the matter over to his lawyer. In her texts, Andrea Manafort dismissed the idea that her father would have taken cash as described in the Ukrainian ledger. "It's just a bunch of hogwash," she wrote a few days after he resigned. "My dad is a lot of things, but he isn't stupid." But she also apparently expressed deep reservations about his work overseas. "Don't fool yourself," she wrote to her sister in 2015, according to the posted texts. "The money we have is blood money." Andrea Manafort also portrayed her father as being at the center of Trump's campaign, texting a friend in April that he was Trump's "right hand man," one posted message said. "He's super tight w the trumps. All the kids call him all the time," she wrote, according to the messages posted online. Roth reported from Kiev, Ukraine. Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.

The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news and blamed on Democrats. In a bruising five-hour session, the FBI director also knocked down Trump's claim that his predecessor had wiretapped his New York skyscraper, an assertion that has distracted White House officials and frustrated fellow Republicans who acknowledge they've seen no evidence to support it. The revelation of the investigation of possible collusion with Russians, and the first public confirmation of the wider probe that began last summer, came in a remarkable hearing by one branch of government examining serious allegations against another branch and the new president's election campaign. Tight-lipped for the most part, Comey refused to offer details on the scope, targets or timeline for the FBI investigation, which could shadow the White House for months, if not years. The director would not say whether the probe has turned up evidence that Trump associates may have schemed with Russians during a campaign marked by email hacking that investigators believe was aimed at helping the Republican defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. "I can promise you," the FBI director vowed, "we will follow the facts wherever they lead." Comey for the first time put himself publicly at odds with the president by contradicting a series of recent tweets from Trump that asserted his phones had been ordered tapped by President Barack Obama during the campaign. "With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI," Comey said. The same was true, he added, of the Justice Department. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. His confirmation of the Russia-links investigation was striking given the FBI's historic reluctance to discuss its work. But Comey said the intense public interest in the matter — and permission from the Justice Department — made it appropriate to do so. Comey said the collusion inquiry began last July as part of a broader probe into Russian meddling in American politics, meaning Trump was elected president as associates remained under investigation for possible connections to Russia. Clinton allies on Monday contrasted Comey's silence during the campaign with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before Election Day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails. Many Democrats blame Comey's public updates with stoking worries about Clinton's trustworthiness and turning voters against her. Comey acknowledged that "some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances" where he and other officials were more open, but he said those were about concluded investigations. FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign.

In the current case, it's not clear how long it will take for the FBI to decide if a crime was committed, but counterintelligence investigations are known for being complicated and time-intensive — and for frequently concluding without charges. Comey would not commit to a timetable. Regardless of the outcome, the investigation is unquestionably an unwelcome distraction for an administration that has struggled to move past questions about ties to Russia. The White House tried anew Monday to distance itself from two former senior members of Trump's team, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who have been under scrutiny for foreign contacts. Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Comey that revelations about the investigation had placed a "big gray cloud" over people trying to lead the country. "The faster you can get to the bottom of this, it's going to be better for all Americans," he said. Comey is the latest government official to reject Trump's claims, made without any evidence, that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters.. Nunes rejected them earlier in the hearing. Comey testified along with National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers, who also disputed allegations that British intelligence services could have been involved in such wiretapping. The White House last week pointed to a report of British involvement in an attempt to bolster the president's claim. The move only angered an ally. The hearing quickly divided along partisan lines, Democrats pressing for details on the status of the FBI's investigation while Republicans focused on news coverage and possible improper disclosures of classified information developed through surveillance. Trump took to Twitter before Monday's hearing began, accusing Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates. He said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Clinton instead. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" Trump tweeted early Monday as news coverage on the Russia allegations dominated the morning's cable news. The president continued to tweet throughout the hearing, creating an unusual public conversation between the embattled president and his FBI director. After Trump tweeted that the FBI and NSA had told Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process, Comey disputed that description. The FBI has offered no opinion and has no view and no information on the potential impact on the election because that's not something the bureau has looked at, he said. The president also claimed that Comey had said there was no evidence of collusion between his aides and Russia, though Comey said no such thing. Trump also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. U.S. intelligence officials have not publicly raised the possibility of contacts between the Clintons and Moscow. Officials have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Trump's election bid. The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, outlined a chronology that he said suggested frequent and troubling contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries. "Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than a entirely unhappy coincidence?" he asked rhetorically. "Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated."

On Monday, unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign, substantiated claims about Russia's meddling in the U.S. election to help Trump win, and cloudy claims about Trump associates' ties to Russia all came to a head. FBI Director James B. Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers testified before the House Intelligence Committee in a rare public hearing about what they know and what they want to know. There was no smoking gun from either side's perspective, but we did learn more about what the FBI is investigating and what Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to investigate. Below are six takeaways from the hearing. 1. There's no evidence of President Donald Trump's accusation that Obama tapped his phones Comey quickly confirmed where the last few weeks seemed to have been leading: There is no evidence to back up Trump's claim that Obama ordered wiretapping of his Trump Tower phones. "I have no information that supports those tweets," Comey said. Comey's clear-as-day comments make it impossible for Trump to keep saying he was "wiretapped." FBI Director James B. Comey confirms his agency is investigating possible cooperation between Russia and Trump campaign associates. FBI Director James B. Comey confirms his agency is investigating possible cooperation between Russia and Trump campaign associates. But really, the whole wiretapping thing felt like a sidebar in this hearing to the FBI's broader investigation into Russia and any Trump associates' ties. That's in part because most lawmakers feel it IS a sidebar to the real issue: A foreign country interfered in a U.S. election with the intent of undermining the United States' political process. "The stakes are nothing less than the future of our democracy and liberal democracy," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, Calif., the top Democrat on the committee. So let's get into that. 2. The FBI is investigating connections between Trump's campaign associates and the Russian government This might seem to be an obvious takeaway. The Washington Post and other news organizations reported this two months ago. But members of Congress have been extremely frustrated that, until Monday, the FBI has refused to privately acknowledge the existence of an investigation, let alone what it is looking into. (The FBI rarely acknowledges publicly the existence of an ongoing investigation except, in Comey's words, in "unusual circumstances.") This, apparently, is one of those circumstances. On Monday, Comey told Congress and the world that, yes, the FBI is investigating Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. In addition, it is investigating whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and "whether any crimes were committed." 3. But the FBI is going to be VERY tight-lipped about the investigation In the next breath, Comey said he is not going to share much else about the investigation other than it exists: "We just cannot do our work well or fairly if we start talking about it while we're doing it." And he cautioned Congress and the public not too read too much into the FBI's silence about it: "I know speculating is part of human nature, but it really isn't fair to draw conclusions simply because I say that I can't comment." A caution Trump himself did not seem to heed in this tweet: "FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia." Throughout the hearing, Comey would stay true to his word, especially when lawmakers asked about what investigators knew with regard to Trump officials: "I really don't want to get into answering any questions about any U.S. person," he said at one point. The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... 4. Democrats seem pretty sure associates with Trump's campaign colluded with Russia Here's what we know about Trump's campaign and Russia: The intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the U.S. election to undermine faith in the democratic process and harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy, in part because Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed then-Secretary of State Clinton for domestic protests against his authority in 2011-2012. Two members of Trump's inner circle - former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions - have publicly acknowledged that they failed to disclose private conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn lost his job; Sessions agreed to recuse himself from the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election as a result. But meeting with the Russian ambassador to Washington isn't illegal - in fact, you could argue it's part of diplomacy. It's the lack of disclosure that got both men in trouble. Democrats are suggesting that Russia's involvement in the election and Trump officials' lack of disclosure about their ties to Russia point to something more. In a 15-minute opening statement, Schiff laid out a series of ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, citing former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled an unverified dossier on Trump and Russia. They included accusations that: One of Trump's national security advisers during the campaign, Carter Page, has ties to Russia and has praised its president, Vladimir Putin. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had been on the payroll for pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. Trump officials met with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the Republican National Convention. At that convention, Republicans changed their platform to remove a section that supported giving weapons to Ukraine as it battles Russia for territory. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone boasted in a speech that he knew of impending WikiLeaks documents related to Hillary Clinton's campaign before they were published. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., left, questions witnesses as chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., looks on during a House Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington on March 20, 2017. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., left, questions witnesses as chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., looks on during a House Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington on March 20, 2017. And Flynn and Sessions would go on to avoid disclosing their conversations with the Russian ambassador during or shortly after the campaign. After spelling all that out, Schiff (rhetorically) asked this: "Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don't know. Not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out." Comey and Rogers would not comment. But we know what Democrats have concluded. 5. Republicans, meanwhile, want to focus on intelligence leaks to the press If Democrats' line of questioning focused on alleged Trump ties to Russia, Republicans zeroed in on charges that someone in the intelligence community was leaking these intelligence reports to the media. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., stressed that the leaks may have been politically motivated to weaken the Trump administration. This has the potential to be a major point of friction between Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee as it pursues its own investigation into Russian meddling: Should the committee put more effort into finding out who leaked the information than whether there is any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia? 6. Intelligence officials still don't think there's any evidence Russia's meddling directly influenced votes Early on, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, asked Rogers and Comey whether they had any evidence that Russia actually changed the vote tallies in key states. Both men said there is no evidence that Russian meddling actually changed votes, something they also said in a January Senate hearing. To some degree, the laser focus on vote tallies is a straw man argument, points out The Washington Post's Aaron Blake: It's nearly impossible to hack voting machines, and intelligence reports never implied that happened. But Republicans like Nunes also can't emphasize enough that Russia's meddling to help Trump win probably did not actually help Trump win. They do this to underscore the legitimacy of his presidency, yes, but also to get Trump to recognize his own legitimacy. Trump was originally hesitant to even acknowledge Russian meddling. He since has acknowledged it, but Republicans (and the intelligence community) need his full support to continue to investigate this, wherever it leads.

President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The White House on Wednesday acknowledged the AP's revelations had "started to catch a lot of buzz" but brushed them aside, though some members of Congress expressed alarm. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government." White House spokesman Sean Spicer indicated Wednesday that President Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska. "To suggest that the president knew who his clients were from 10 years ago is a bit insane," Spicer said. He noted the AP's reporting "has started to catch a lot of buzz" but said Manafort's work occurred long before he became Trump's campaign chairman. "I don't know what he got paid to do," Spicer said, adding, "There's no suggestion he did anything improper." Manafort's plans were laid out in detailed documents obtained by the AP that included strategy memoranda and records showing international wire transfers for millions of dollars. How much work Manafort performed under the contract was unclear. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests. New corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election. The allegations... New corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election. The allegations... Manafort confirmed again Wednesday in a statement that he had worked for Deripaska but denied his work had been pro-Russian in nature. He added, "I look forward to meeting with those conducting serious investigations of these issues." An official representative of Deripaska said simply in a statement Wednesday: "There was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr Deripaska which now is a subject to legal claims." The disclosures come as Trump campaign advisers are the subject of an FBI probe and two congressional investigations, and they appear to guarantee that Manafort will be sought as a key witness in upcoming hearings. Investigators are reviewing whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 campaign. Manafort has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated and misguided. The documents obtained by AP show Manafort's ties to Russia were closer than previously revealed. Paul Manafort, then-campaign chairman for Donald Trump, is interviewed on the floor of the Republican National Convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland in July 2016. Paul Manafort, then-campaign chairman for Donald Trump, is interviewed on the floor of the Republican National Convention at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland in July 2016. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the disclosures "serious stuff" and more evidence that an independent congressional committee should investigate the Trump administration. "Other shoes will drop," he said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic, said of Manafort: "Clearly, if he's getting millions of dollars from a billionaire close to Putin, to basically undermine democratic movements, that's something I'd want to know about. I doubt if Trump knew about it." Democrats on the House intelligence committee said the new revelations will feature in their investigations. The disclosure "undermines the groundless assertions that the administration has been making that there are no ties between President Trump and Russia. This is not a drip, drip, drip," said Rep. Jackie Speier of California. "This is now dam-breaking with water flushing out with all kinds of entanglements." Deripaska became one of Russia's wealthiest men under Putin, buying assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin's interests. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described him as "among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis" and "a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad." In response to questions about Manafort's consulting firm, a spokesman for Deripaska in 2008 — at least three years after they began working together — said Deripaska had never hired the firm. Another Deripaska spokesman in Moscow last week declined to answer AP's questions. Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman last year from March until August, a period that included the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump in July. Trump asked Manafort to resign after AP revealed that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's ruling pro-Russian political party. The newly obtained business records link Manafort more directly to Putin's interests in the region. According to those records and people with direct knowledge of Manafort's work for Deripaska, Manafort made plans to open an office in Moscow, and at least some of his work in Ukraine was directed by Deripaska, not local political interests there. The Moscow office never opened. Manafort has been a leading focus of the U.S. intelligence investigation of Trump's associates and Russia, according to a U.S. official. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation are confidential. Meanwhile, federal criminal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014. No U.S. criminal charges have ever been filed in the case. FBI Director James Comey, in confirming to Congress the federal intelligence investigation this week, declined to say whether Manafort was a target. Manafort's name was mentioned 28 times during the hearing of the House intelligence committee, mostly about his work in Ukraine. No one mentioned Deripaska. On Monday, Spicer had said Manafort "played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time" in the presidential campaign, even though he was Trump's campaign chairman. Spicer on Wednesday said further that Manafort was hired to oversee the campaign's delegate operation. "To be clear, he got the job done on the delegates," Spicer said. Manafort and his associates remain in Trump's orbit. Manafort told a colleague this year that he continues to speak with Trump by telephone. Manafort's former business partner in eastern Europe, Rick Gates, has been seen inside the White House on a number of occasions, helped plan Trump's inauguration and now runs a nonprofit organization, America First Policies, to back the White House agenda. Gates, whose name does not appear in the documents, told the AP that he joined Manafort's firm in 2006 and was aware Manafort had a relationship with Deripaska but was not aware of the work described in the memos. Gates said his work was focused on domestic U.S. lobbying and political consulting in Ukraine at the time. He said he stopped working for Manafort's firm in March 2016 when he joined Trump's presidential campaign. Manafort told Deripaska in 2005 that he was pushing policies as part of his work in Ukraine "at the highest levels of the U.S. government — the White House, Capitol Hill and the State Department," according to the documents. He also said he had hired a "leading international law firm with close ties to President Bush to support our client's interests," but he did not identify the firm. Manafort also said he was employing unidentified legal experts for the effort at leading universities and think tanks, including Duke University, New York University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political leaders or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the department. Willfully failing to register is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though the government rarely files criminal charges. "I don't know if he violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act," Sen. Graham said, "but it's something I think we all need to know more about." Deripaska owns Basic Element Co., which employs 200,000 people worldwide in the agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, financial services, insurance and manufacturing industries, and he runs one of the world's largest aluminum companies. Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.2 billion. How much Deripaska paid Manafort in total is not clear, but people familiar with the relationship said money transfers to Manafort amounted to tens of millions of dollars and continued through at least 2009. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secret payments publicly. In strategy memos, Manafort proposed that Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine. He proposed building "long term relationships" with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region. Manafort proposed extending his existing work in eastern Europe to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Georgia, where he pledged to bolster the legitimacy of governments friendly to Putin and undercut anti-Russian figures through political campaigns, nonprofit front groups and media operations. For the $10 million annual contract, Manafort did not use his public-facing consulting firm, Davis Manafort. Instead, he used a company, LOAV Ltd., that he had registered in Delaware in 1992. He listed LOAV as having the same address as his lobbying and consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. In other records, LOAV's address was listed as Manafort's home, also in Alexandria. Manafort sold the home in July 2015 for $1.4 million. He now owns an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, as well as other properties in Florida and New York. One strategy memo to Deripaska was written by Manafort and Rick Davis, his business partner at the time. In written responses to the AP, Davis said he did not know that his firm had proposed a plan to covertly promote the interests of the Russian government. Davis said he believes Manafort used his name without his permission on the strategy memo. "My name was on every piece of stationery used by the company and in every memo prior to 2006. It does not mean I had anything to do with the memo described," Davis said. He took a leave of absence from the firm in late 2006 to work on Sen. McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Manafort's work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court. The billionaire gave Manafort nearly $19 million to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska's representatives. It said that after taking the money, Manafort and his associates stopped responding to Deripaska's queries about how the funds had been used. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska's representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the nomination, Deripaska's representatives said they would no longer discuss the case.

It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief - a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America's staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead, President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday exchange. Then, 25 minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call, Trump abruptly ended it. At one point, Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day - including Russian President Vladimir Putin - and that "this was the worst call by far." Trump's behavior suggests that he is capable of subjecting world leaders, including close allies, to a version of the vitriol he frequently employs against political adversaries and news organizations in speeches and on Twitter. "This is the worst deal ever," Trump fumed as Turnbull attempted to confirm that the United States would honor its pledge to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Trump, who one day earlier had signed an executive order temporarily barring the admission of refugees, complained that he was "going to get killed" politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the "next Boston bombers." Trump returned to the topic late Wednesday night, writing in a message on Twitter: "Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!" U.S. officials said that Trump has behaved similarly in conversations with leaders of other countries, including Mexico. But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia - countries that share intelligence, support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The characterizations provide insight into Trump's temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation's chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. The depictions of Trump's calls are also at odds with sanitized White House accounts. The official readout of his conversation with Turnbull, for example, said that the two had "emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally." A White House spokesman declined to comment. A senior administration official acknowledged that the conversation with Turnbull had been hostile and charged, but emphasized that most of Trump's calls with foreign leaders - including the heads of Japan, Germany, France and Russia - have been productive and pleasant. Trump also vented anger and touted his political accomplishments in a tense conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, officials said. The two have sparred for months over Trump's vow to force Mexico to pay for construction of a border wall between the two countries, a conflict that prompted Peña Nieto to cancel a planned meeting with Trump. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Even in conversations marred by hostile exchanges, Trump manages to work in references to his election accomplishments. U.S. officials said that he used his calls with Turnbull and Peña Nieto to mention his election win or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. One official said that it may be Trump's way of "speaking about the mandate he has and why he has the backing for decisions he makes." But Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and even a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote. The friction with Turnbull reflected Trump's anger over being bound by an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world. The issue centers on a population of about 2,500 people who sought asylum in Australia but were diverted to facilities off that country's coast at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Deplorable conditions at those sites prompted intervention from the United Nations and a pledge from the United States to accept about half of those refugees, provided they passed U.S. security screening. Many of the refugees came from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, countries listed in Trump's order temporarily barring their citizens from entry to the United States. A special provision in the Trump order allows for exceptions to honor "a preexisting international agreement," a line that was inserted to cover the Australia deal. But U.S. officials said that Trump continued to fume about the arrangement even after signing the order in a ceremony at the Pentagon. President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump's remarks came at the top of what was... "I don't want these people," Trump said. He repeatedly misstated the number of refugees called for in the agreement as 2,000 rather than 1,250, and told Turnbull that it was "my intention" to honor the agreement, a phrase designed to leave the U.S. president wiggle room to back out of the deal in the future, according to a senior U.S. official. Before Trump tweeted about the agreement Wednesday night, the U.S. Embassy in Canberra had assured Australian reporters that the new administration intended to take the refugees. "President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed," an embassy spokesman had told the reporters, according to an official in the Sydney consulate. "This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this embassy at 1315 Canberra time." The time the embassy said it was informed the deal was going ahead was 9:15 p.m. in Washington, one hour and 40 minutes before Trump suggested in a tweet that it might not go ahead. During the phone conversation Saturday, Turnbull told Trump that to honor the agreement, the United States would not have to accept all of the refugees but only to allow each through the normal vetting procedures. At that, Trump vowed to subject each refugee to "extreme vetting," the senior U.S. official said. Trump was also skeptical because he did not see a specific advantage the United States would gain by honoring the deal, officials said. Trump's position appears to reflect the transactional view he takes of relationships, even when it comes to diplomatic ties with long-standing allies. Australian troops have fought alongside U.S. forces for decades, and the country maintains close cooperation with Washington on trade and economic issues. Australia is seen as such a trusted ally that it is one of only four countries that the United States includes in the "Five Eyes" arrangement for cooperation on espionage matters. Members share extensively what their intelligence services gather and generally refrain from spying on one another. There also is a significant amount of tourism between the two countries. Trump made the call to Turnbull about 5 p.m. Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. At one point, Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues. But Trump demurred and ended the call, making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan, Angela Merkel of Germany, François Hollande of France or Putin. "These conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately," Turnbull said at a news conference Thursday in Australia. "If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them." A. Odysseus Patrick in Sydney, Australia, contributed to this report.

The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn - national security adviser to then-President-elect Donald Trump - but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said. The calls were picked up as part of routine electronic surveillance of Russian officials and agents in the United States, which is one of the FBI's responsibilities, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss counterintelligence operations. Nonetheless, the fact that communications by a senior member of Trump's national security team have been under scrutiny points up the challenge facing the intelligence community as it continues its wide-ranging probe of Russian government influence in the U.S. election and whether there was any improper back-channel contacts between Moscow and Trump associates and acquaintances. Although Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were listened to, Flynn himself is not the active target of an investigation, U.S. officials said. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that U.S. counterintelligence agents had investigated the communications between Flynn and Kislyak. President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. have been in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday. After... President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. have been in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday. After... Of particular note was a Dec. 29 telephone conversation, initiated in an exchange of text messages the day before. Trump officials previously had said the call took place on the 28th. On the 29th, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia and expelled 35 officials from the Russian Embassy in response to what the U.S. intelligence community has said was interference in the presidential election on Trump's behalf. Earlier this month and on Monday, during his first official White House news conference, press secretary Sean Spicer said that the call covered several subjects. They included a Russian invitation to the Trump administration to take part in Russian-sponsored Syrian peace talks that began Monday in Kazakhstan. The men also talked about logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn also conveyed condolences for a Russian plane crash that killed a famed military band the day before the call, said Spicer, who said that Kislyak initiated the call after he and Flynn exchanged holiday greetings by text. Spicer also said Monday that the two had followed up with a subsequent call "two days ago ... three days ago" to further discuss a Trump-Putin call. In remarks when the Dec. 28 call was first reported this month, Spicer and other officials said there had been no mention of the sanctions that were announced the next day. On Monday, he said he was unaware of any other conversations between Flynn and members of the Russian government. Spicer said he asked Flynn if there had been conversations with any other Russian officials "beyond the ambassador. He said no." Earlier press reports had also cited a Flynn call to Kislyak on Dec. 19 to express condolences for the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Turkey that day.

Although Flynn has written critically about Russia, he also was paid to deliver a speech at a 2015 Moscow gala for RT, the Kremlin-sponsored international television station, at which he was seated next to Putin. The FBI's counterintelligence agents listen to calls all the time that do not pertain to any open investigation, current and former law enforcement officials said. Often, said one former official, "they're just monitoring the other (foreign official) side of the call." Both Flynn, a former head of the Pentagon's intelligence agency, and Kislyak, a seasoned diplomat, are probably aware that Kislyak's phone calls and texts are being monitored, current and former officials said. That would make it highly unlikely, the individuals said, that the men would allow their calls to be conduits of illegal coordination.

National security adviser Michael Flynn spoke privately with Vice President Mike Pence on Friday in an apparent attempt to contain the fallout from the disclosure that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with that country's ambassador and then allowed Pence and other White House officials to publicly deny that he had done so, an administration official said. The conversation took place as senior Democrats in Congress called for existing investigations of Russia's interference in the 2016 election to expand in scope to scrutinize Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak weeks before the Trump administration took office. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that if the allegations are proven, Flynn should step down. "If the now-national security adviser was undermining U.S. national security interests, he's unfit to hold that office," Schiff said in an interview with The Washington Post. "Compounding the issue is whether he then misled the country about the nature of his contacts." Current and former U.S. officials said that in his conversation with Kislyak in late December, Flynn urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to punitive sanctions being imposed on Russia by former President Barack Obama's administration, signaling that the Trump administration would revisit the issue when it took office. Those contacts were seen by some U.S. officials as potentially illegal interference in the U.S. relationship with Moscow at a time when U.S. intelligence agencies were concluding that Russia had waged extensive cyber and influence campaigns to upend the 2016 presidential race and help to elect Trump. National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. Flynn's... President Trump claimed to be unaware of the Flynn controversy as he traveled to Florida on Friday afternoon as part of a weekend trip with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In a brief exchange with reporters during the flight south, Trump was asked about the report in The Post that Flynn had discussed sanctions against Russia despite repeated denials. "I don't know about that, I haven't seen it," Trump said, according to a transcript of the conversation. "What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll look into that." Flynn's relationship with Pence was placed under particular strain because the vice president - apparently relying on inaccurate accounts from Flynn - publicly declared that Flynn had never discussed sanctions with the Russian diplomat. A senior administration official said Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning and by phone in the evening. Officials declined to discuss the outcome of the conversations. The two men could be seen engaging in an awkward handshake later in the day while taking their seats in the audience for Trump's news conference with Abe.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler... The controversy fanned speculation about Flynn's standing in the White House and whether he would face pressure to resign. The senior administration official disputed that Flynn was in jeopardy. "He seems fine," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. "He's in every meeting he's supposed to be doing, fulfilling his job as national security adviser. He's seeing the president constantly." Flynn also traveled to Florida with Trump. Republicans were quiet on the matter Friday, but senior Democrats called for investigations of Flynn's contacts with Kislyak. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, called for FBI Director James Comey to testify before the committee on the status of the bureau's examination of Flynn's calls. Schiff said that he intends to request the intelligence reports on Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador. Their contacts were captured as part of routine U.S. intelligence surveillance of Russian officials in the United States. "This is one discrete set of allegations that ought to be simple to prove or disprove," Schiff said. "If these allegations are true, it ought to compel him to step down." Senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo requesting a review of Flynn's security clearance.

The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called "judicial usurpation of power." White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the author of the controversial executive order, said the administration was simultaneously weighing several legal options after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously on Thursday against reinstating the travel ban, which had been blocked temporarily by a federal judge in Washington state. Miller said that officials are considering appealing with the 9th Circuit and having an emergency hearing "en banc," or before all judges on the court; seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court; taking the case to trial at the district level; or writing a new executive order for Trump to sign that would withstand legal scrutiny. In unusually combative interviews on the Sunday morning television shows, Miller also refused to say whether Trump still has confidence in his national security adviser amid controversy over his communications with Russian officials. Miller also advanced false claims that widespread voter fraud undermined Trump's performance in November's election. Miller insisted that Trump has the constitutional authority to ban the entry of certain foreigners, saying the actions represent "the very apex of presidential authority." "I want to say something very clearly, and this is going to be very disappointing to the people protesting the president and the people in Congress, like (Senate Democratic Leader Charles E.) Schumer, who have attacked the president for his lawful and necessary action: The president's powers here are beyond question," Miller said on Fox News. White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller appeared on ABC's "The Week" on Feb. 12, spouting a bunch of false talking points on alleged voter fraud. (He also repeated similar claims on other Sunday interview shows.) To his credit, host George Stephanopoulus repeatedly challenged Miller, noting...

(He also repeated similar claims on other Sunday interview shows.) To his credit, host George Stephanopoulus repeatedly challenged Miller, noting... Appearing also on ABC News, Miller said, "A district judge in Seattle cannot force the president of the United States to change our laws and our Constitution because of their own personal views. The president has the power ... to suspend the entry of aliens when it's in the national interest." Miller said on CBS News that the judiciary was acting like "a supreme branch of government." "One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country," Miller told anchor John Dickerson. "I mean, this is just crazy, John. The idea that you're going to have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is beyond anything we've ever seen before." Miller also suggested that the legal debate was not over the constitutionality of Trump's action, but rather over ideology. As a young conservative in liberal Santa Monica, Calif., Stephen Miller clashed frequently with his high school, often calling in to a national radio show to lambaste administrators for promoting multiculturalism, allowing Spanish-language morning announcements and failing to require recitation... As a young conservative in liberal Santa Monica, Calif., Stephen Miller clashed frequently with his high school, often calling in to a national radio show to lambaste administrators for promoting multiculturalism, allowing Spanish-language morning announcements and failing to require recitation... "There is no constitutional right for a citizen in a foreign country, who has no status in America, to demand entry into our country," the adviser said on ABC. "Such a right cannot exist. Such a right will never exist. This is an ideological disagreement between those who believe we should have borders and should have controls and those who believe there should be no borders and no controls." Miller's exchanges with the Sunday show hosts were testy on other subjects as well. He punted when ABC anchor George Stephanopolous asked him about The Washington Post's report that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn discussed the then-Obama administration's sanctions against Russia in conversations with that country's ambassador before Flynn was sworn in as White House national security adviser. "I don't have any news to make you today on this point," Miller said, prompting Stephanopoulos to ask, "Then why are you coming in if you can't answer the questions being posed about the White House?" On NBC, when anchor Chuck Todd asked Miller whether Trump still had confidence in Flynn, Miller said he did not know. Miller said his colleagues in the White House "did not give me anything to say." "It's not for me to tell you what's in the president's mind," he told Todd. "That's a question for the president." Miller also repeated the false claim that Trump underperformed in the general election because of "massive voter fraud." Miller provided no evidence to support his assertions in his ABC appearance - something Stephanopolous pointed out to viewers. Miller repeated claims Trump made privately to senators this past week that he narrowly lost the general election in New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to vote illegally there. "I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who's worked in New Hampshire politics," Miller said. "It's very real. It's very serious." There is no known evidence of this happening. Miller went on to say that there is "enormous evidence" of people being registered to vote in more than one state, of "dead people voting" and noncitizens being registered to vote. "George, it is a fact - and you will not deny it - that there are massive numbers of noncitizens in this country who are registered to vote," Miller said. "That is a scandal. We should stop the presses. And, as a country, we should be aghast about the fact that you have people who have no right to vote in this country registered to vote, canceling out the franchise of lawful citizens of this country." At that, Stephanopolous intoned: "For the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence that the president's claim that he would have won the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn't voted - zero evidence for either one of those claims." Miller's combative appearances pleased his boss, who apparently was watching from Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump tweeted: "Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!"

White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is under increasing political pressure and risks losing the confidence of some colleagues following reports that he misled senior administration officials about his discussion of sanctions with a Russian envoy shortly before President Trump took office. As White House aides scramble to get their stories straight about the exact nature of those communications and as Democrats call for Flynn's security clearance to be suspended or revoked, neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or signaled that he has the president's confidence. Privately, some administration officials said that Flynn's position has weakened and support for him has eroded largely because of a belief that he was disingenuous about Russia and therefore could not be fully trusted going forward. "The knives are out for Flynn," said one administration official who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. On Sunday, the top White House aide dispatched to represent the administration on the political talk shows pointedly declined to defend Flynn. Asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" whether the president had confidence in Flynn, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said he did not know. "It's not for me to tell you what's in the president's mind," Miller told moderator Chuck Todd. He added that his colleagues at the White House "did not give me anything to say" about Flynn. When ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Miller about Flynn's interactions with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, Miller said, "I don't have any news to make . . . today on this point." The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T.

The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn - national security adviser to then-President-elect Donald Trump - but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian... The Washington Post revealed last week that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in the month before Trump's inauguration. The Post's finding, confirmed by nine current and former U.S. officials, contrasted with the assurances made publicly by Vice President Pence and other top administration officials that Flynn never talked about sanctions with Russian officials. Based on Flynn's private assurances, Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House press secretary Sean Spicer stated publicly that Flynn never discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Pence spoke to Flynn twice on Friday - once face to face and by telephone, according to an administration official who declined to characterize the contents of those discussions. "Flynn is running out of friends, no question," a different administration official said. "The broad consensus in the White House is that he lied. The vice president feels like he lied. In a position that needs to be no drama, it's nonstop drama. I would be very surprised if he lasts much longer." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, R, an informal adviser to Trump, called on Flynn to "clear up" what happened with Trump and Pence, but he stopped short of accusing him of wrongdoing. "I think that's the obligation of General Flynn, his national security adviser, to have those type of candid conversations with the president and the vice president," Christie said on CNN. "And then they will act as they see fit, given all the circumstances." Over the weekend at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, the president privately voiced frustration with Flynn and the political baggage he is hanging on the White House, according to two people familiar with his comments. Spicer denied that Trump criticized Flynn to anyone at the club and called assertions to the contrary "fake news." People close to Flynn said he feels confident in his position despite the swirling controversy. He flew to Florida this weekend with the president along with other National Security Council officials to engage with his Japanese counterparts during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit. Furthermore, people in Trump's orbit cautioned that it would not be in the president's nature to fire Flynn because doing so would amount to an admission of guilt and misjudgment in the face of media scrutiny, as well as demonstrate chaos in the early weeks of his presidency. The doubts about the national security adviser come as Trump faces his first significant provocation from a U.S. adversary overseas. North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the weekend, a move suspected by some experts as designed to serve as a test of components of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. Trump responded on Saturday night in a joint appearance with Abe at Mar-a-Lago, where he reassured his Japanese counterpart that the United States fully supported Japan. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and a decorated intelligence officer, met Trump in late 2015 to offer advice about his campaign and signed on with Trump the following year. He won Trump's approval during the general election with his willingness to travel regularly and deliver fiery stump speeches trashing Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Democratic leaders have called for investigations into the Flynn's contact with Russian officials and for Trump to suspend and revoke Flynn's security clearance. "President Trump's kowtowing to Vladimir Putin is endangering our national security and emboldening a dangerous tyrant," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Saturday. Rep. Elijah Cummings, Md., the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Sunday on ABC News that suspending Flynn's clearance would be "an appropriate action." Trump has not yet issued a comment about Flynn, either on Twitter or in one of his brief appearances before journalists over the weekend. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, reporters asked Trump about The Post's report on Flynn's discussion of sanctions and the president claimed he did not know about it, even though it had by then become a major story across cable news. "I don't know about that. I haven't seen it," Trump said during a flight to Florida from Washington. "What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll look into that." The Washington Post's Greg Miller contributed to this report.

Just hours before North Korea fired a failed ballistic missile, President Donald Trump spent his morning enjoying the blue, breezy weather on Florida's eastern coast here Saturday, zipping around the greens of his private golf club. The day before, the president also passed the morning playing golf at Trump International Golf Club, according to someone who saw him on the course. And in addressing North Korea's latest provocation, Trump - who spent at least a portion of both evenings greeting guests at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida - deferred to his Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general. "The president and his military team are aware of North Korea's most recent unsuccessful missile launch," Mattis said in a two-sentence, emailed statement Saturday night. "The president has no further comment." On the question of North Korea, one of the United States's most immediate geopolitical threats, Trump was uncharacteristically quiet over the weekend, instead leaving it to his team of deputies, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, to articulate the administration's policy toward the totalitarian regime. In addition to Mattis' terse statement, the vice president - who arrived in Seoul for a 10-day trip through Asia shortly after the failed launch - briefly addressed North Korea's latest action at a dinner of U.S. troops and their family members, and a White House foreign policy adviser on the trip briefed reporters traveling with Pence, as well. The White House displayed a tough and unyielding approach to North Korea and its nuclear ambitions Monday, with President Donald Trump warning that Kim Jong Un has "gotta behave" and Vice President Mike Pence sternly advising Kim not to test America's resolve and military power. Trump, in Washington,... The White House displayed a tough and unyielding approach to North Korea and its nuclear ambitions Monday, with President Donald Trump warning that Kim Jong Un has "gotta behave" and Vice President Mike Pence sternly advising Kim not to test America's resolve and military power. Trump, in Washington,... "This morning's provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face each and every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world," Pence said. "Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires." Mattis' statement, as well as Trump's lack of comment Saturday night, stood in stark contrast to the president's behavior just two months ago, when North Korea claimed in mid-February that it had successfully tested a new type of missile with nuclear capabilities. In response then, Trump - who was again at Mar-a-Lago for a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - scrambled his traveling press corps to deliver an in-person statement that evening, after he and his aides seemed to pour over the latest intelligence in full view of his club members. But as tensions mounted earlier in the week between the United States and North Korea - which is forging ahead with its nuclear weapons program and eager to build a missile that can reach the United States - the president departed the White House Thursday for what he seemed to hope would be a quiet Easter weekend holiday. President Donald Trump says "someone should look into who paid" for the rallies around the country Saturday that urged him to release his tax returns. Trump tweeted Sunday: "I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are... President Donald Trump says "someone should look into who paid" for the rallies around the country Saturday that urged him to release his tax returns. Trump tweeted Sunday: "I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are... He brought with him only three junior staffers and K.T. McFarland, a deputy national security adviser who was recently demoted and offered a posting as ambassador to Singapore as a concession. The president was in touch, however, with Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Mattis, with whom he spoke several times between Thursday and Saturday, as the situation unfolded, according to a senior administration official. But in the hours after the failed launch, Trump - who previously has said the United States is willing to intervene on its own if others in the region don't step up - allowed his advisers, including McFarland and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, to outline the administration's approach on the Sunday shows. McMaster and McFarland offered a notable contrast to Trump's previously bellicose statements. Both seemed to be calling for patience and tamping down the possibility of imminent military intervention. McMaster, appearing on ABC's "This Week," said that the United States is exploring "a range of options" to respond to an increasingly provocative North Korea but said the administration would like "to take action short of armed conflict, so we can avoid the worst." McFarland, meanwhile, downplayed the significance of yet another failed missile launch, saying the early Sunday test was "not a surprise." "Even in the last year, President Kim of North Korea has launched over 30 missiles," McFarland said. "Most of them have failed. So it didn't come as a surprise to us. We were expecting something surrounding the birthday of his grandfather." Saturday was the anniversary of the 1912 birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder and the current leader's grandfather. Both McMaster and McFarland also talked up the role China could play in bringing North Korea to heel - and urged some patience on that front. About 80 percent of North Korea's trade is with neighboring China, giving the country a good deal of leverage, they suggested. McFarland said that an array of strategies were discussed when Chinese President Xi Jinping recently visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago. "It's like your kids in the back of the car on a long trip saying, 'When are we going to get there?' " McFarland said. "Well, in this case, I think we should give the Chinese president some opportunities and some time, as well as pursuing the economic and diplomatic pressures that we have and that our allies have that we can bring to bear on North Korea." Trump, who save for muscling Neil M. Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court has no real achievements on Capitol Hill of which to boast, has weathered a series of national security and military crisis less than 100 days into his presidency, and seems to enjoy both the process and the projection of strength involved. After Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deployed chemical weapons on his own people, Trump worked with his military advisers and responded swiftly, deploying 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syrian airfield. Aides to the president said he enjoyed the orderly process, overseen by McMaster, which resembled the streamlined operations of a more traditional White House, with Trump requesting a range of responses and each adviser weighing in with their expertise, before the president made a final decision. But Trump seemed determined to avoid conflict of just about any sort this weekend - North Korea or otherwise. He spent his three days in Palm Beach shuttling between Mar-a-Lago and Trump International Golf Club, spending almost no time outside the cocoon of his two palm tree lined properties. On Saturday, after golf, the president's motorcade took a different, longer route than usual to return to his private club, coming back from the north and along the coast. The circuitous trip allowed Trump to avoid the protesters who had gathered along the main thoroughfare just west of Mar-a-Lago, to call on him to release his tax returns. Trump, a normally prolific - and brash - user of Twitter, also spent the weekend largely quiet on social media; his last tweet heading into the weekend concerned his enthusiasm about the upcoming White House Easter Egg Roll. On Sunday morning, Trump briefly took to Twitter, boasting about his electoral college victory in the 2016 presidential election and asking why his tax returns mattered in light of his win, and extolling his efforts to rebuild the military. He also seemed to admit he was using the Treasury Department's currency report - which did not label China as a currency manipulator - as a political bargaining weapon. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would brand China a currency manipulator on Day One of his administration. On Day 83, he officially backed off that course. "Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korea problem?" he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. "We will see what happens!" But then the president retreated back into his calm Palm Beach world. He attended Easter services at Bethesda-by-the-Sea church here with his wife, Melania, son Barron and daughter, Tiffany, from his second marriage, before returning to Mar-a-Lago for an annual brunch and Easter egg hunt with his eldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and their families, according to an aide. One intrusion from the outside world came from Don Jr., who over the weekend was sporting a green T-shirt that read "Very Fake News" in block white letters - a reminder of all those who, the president believes, have treated him unfairly.

With President Donald Trump making his seventh presidential trip this weekend to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, government watchdogs and Democrats are once again seeing dollar signs: namely, $3 million. That's a widely used estimate of what each journey costs taxpayers. The figure comes from a government report on a trip President Barack Obama made to Palm Beach, Florida, but the report's author tells The Associated Press that it's a mistake to apply those findings to Trump's travel. A conservative group that closely monitors presidential expenses puts the tab for each Mar-a-Lago visit closer to $1 million. Neither the Secret Service, which protects the president, nor the Department of Defense, which transports presidential vehicles from place to place, has provided a tally of any Mar-a-Lago trip, although a government office is working up estimates that will eventually become public. So why does anyone care whether Trump is frequenting Florida, and how did $3 million become the common wisdom as the cost of each visit? Trump himself drew attention to the issue when he called Obama a "habitual vacationer" who was costing taxpayers money. He repeatedly harangued Obama about it on Twitter between 2011 and last year. The conservative Judicial Watch estimated that Obama's travel expenses totaled at least $96 million over eight years, based on partial responses to its freedom of information requests. In December, the group's president, Tom Fitton, said Obama had engaged in "notorious abuse of presidential travel perks" and called on Trump to overhaul presidential travel. But with seven Mar-a-Lago visits in less than three months, is Trump guilty of the same thing? Fitton says he doesn't think so but added, "It's not what we expected from him, given his criticism of Obama." "The best thing he can do is disclose the numbers and then make the case to taxpayers that it's worth it for him to travel there," Fitton said. "It's a debatable point." Trump's time at Mar-a-Lago appears to be a mix of business and pleasure. He's twice hosted foreign leaders there, twice used the resort as a home base for presidential or campaign events in the area and made 15 visits to his nearby golf courses. The White House doesn't say whether he's golfing. One way Trump is saving presidential travel money: He hasn't yet journeyed overseas, though next month he plans to make a stop in Brussels. With a Republican in the White House, liberal groups are joining Judicial Watch in keeping an eye on travel costs. Before Trump's Mar-a-Lago meeting last week with China President Xi Jinping, the group Public Citizen blasted him for spending another "estimated $3 million." Public Citizen said it is quoting the $3 million figure from Politico and CBS. CNN has also used that number. Those estimates all trace back an October 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office. The facts As fate would have it, the estimate for Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips is based on a 2013 weekend golf trip Obama took to Palm Beach. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, asked the GAO to probe the Obama outing, and its report finally came out last fall. The GAO's bottom line for that trip, not including regular White House personnel costs as well as some classified expenses, was $3.6 million. But the author of that report, Brian Lepore, says that figure shouldn't be applied to Trump's travel. "It's hard to substitute one trip for another, even if the destination is the same," Lepore said. Each time a president travels, the Defense Department must airlift equipment such as the protective limousines, security vehicles and occasionally helicopters from various military bases around the country. A base in Illinois is charged with moving the inventory around, and costs vary widely depending on which base it comes from, he said. Another problem with extrapolating from the October 2016 GAO report is that it included a leg from Washington to Chicago, where Obama gave an economic speech before heading to Palm Beach for a long weekend of golf. Obama was only in Chicago for a few hours, but costs pile up because each destination triggers the need for the Secret Service to prepare and protect the site and the Defense Department to move the equipment involved. Another significant cost-driver, GAO noted, is the per-hour cost of military aircraft, such as the president's plane, Air Force One. So it's not just a matter of slicing off a few hundred thousand dollars to come up with the $3 million estimate. "If you take out Chicago, that just means the equipment is going to have to come from other bases," Lepore said. Sometimes that means more money, sometimes less. Judicial Watch arrives at its $1 million figure by estimating flight time and typical Secret Service costs, leaving out airlifting equipment such as the presidential limousines. Those costs also aren't fully included in Judicial Watch's $96 million total for Obama. More clarity is coming, eventually. The GAO agreed to a Democratic request to price out a few of Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips, and its forthcoming report promises a more accurate estimate. The research could take months or, if the Obama report is any guide, years.

On Monday, unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign, substantiated claims about Russia's meddling in the U.S. election to help Trump win, and cloudy claims about Trump associates' ties to Russia all came to a head. FBI Director James B. Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers testified before the House Intelligence Committee in a rare public hearing about what they know and what they want to know. There was no smoking gun from either side's perspective, but we did learn more about what the FBI is investigating and what Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to investigate. Below are six takeaways from the hearing. 1. There's no evidence of President Donald Trump's accusation that Obama tapped his phones Comey quickly confirmed where the last few weeks seemed to have been leading: There is no evidence to back up Trump's claim that Obama ordered wiretapping of his Trump Tower phones. "I have no information that supports those tweets," Comey said. Comey's clear-as-day comments make it impossible for Trump to keep saying he was "wiretapped." FBI Director James B. Comey confirms his agency is investigating possible cooperation between Russia and Trump campaign associates. FBI Director James B. Comey confirms his agency is investigating possible cooperation between Russia and Trump campaign associates. But really, the whole wiretapping thing felt like a sidebar in this hearing to the FBI's broader investigation into Russia and any Trump associates' ties. That's in part because most lawmakers feel it IS a sidebar to the real issue: A foreign country interfered in a U.S. election with the intent of undermining the United States' political process. "The stakes are nothing less than the future of our democracy and liberal democracy," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, Calif., the top Democrat on the committee. So let's get into that. 2. The FBI is investigating connections between Trump's campaign associates and the Russian government This might seem to be an obvious takeaway. The Washington Post and other news organizations reported this two months ago. But members of Congress have been extremely frustrated that, until Monday, the FBI has refused to privately acknowledge the existence of an investigation, let alone what it is looking into. (The FBI rarely acknowledges publicly the existence of an ongoing investigation except, in Comey's words, in "unusual circumstances.") This, apparently, is one of those circumstances. On Monday, Comey told Congress and the world that, yes, the FBI is investigating Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. In addition, it is investigating whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and "whether any crimes were committed." 3. But the FBI is going to be VERY tight-lipped about the investigation In the next breath, Comey said he is not going to share much else about the investigation other than it exists: "We just cannot do our work well or fairly if we start talking about it while we're doing it." And he cautioned Congress and the public not too read too much into the FBI's silence about it: "I know speculating is part of human nature, but it really isn't fair to draw conclusions simply because I say that I can't comment." A caution Trump himself did not seem to heed in this tweet: "FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia." Throughout the hearing, Comey would stay true to his word, especially when lawmakers asked about what investigators knew with regard to Trump officials: "I really don't want to get into answering any questions about any U.S. person," he said at one point. The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... 4. Democrats seem pretty sure associates with Trump's campaign colluded with Russia Here's what we know about Trump's campaign and Russia: The intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the U.S. election to undermine faith in the democratic process and harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy, in part because Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed then-Secretary of State Clinton for domestic protests against his authority in 2011-2012. Two members of Trump's inner circle - former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions - have publicly acknowledged that they failed to disclose private conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn lost his job; Sessions agreed to recuse himself from the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election as a result. But meeting with the Russian ambassador to Washington isn't illegal - in fact, you could argue it's part of diplomacy. It's the lack of disclosure that got both men in trouble. Democrats are suggesting that Russia's involvement in the election and Trump officials' lack of disclosure about their ties to Russia point to something more. In a 15-minute opening statement, Schiff laid out a series of ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, citing former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled an unverified dossier on Trump and Russia. They included accusations that: One of Trump's national security advisers during the campaign, Carter Page, has ties to Russia and has praised its president, Vladimir Putin. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had been on the payroll for pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. Trump officials met with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the Republican National Convention. At that convention, Republicans changed their platform to remove a section that supported giving weapons to Ukraine as it battles Russia for territory. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone boasted in a speech that he knew of impending WikiLeaks documents related to Hillary Clinton's campaign before they were published. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., left, questions witnesses as chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., looks on during a House Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington on March 20, 2017. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., left, questions witnesses as chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., looks on during a House Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington on March 20, 2017. And Flynn and Sessions would go on to avoid disclosing their conversations with the Russian ambassador during or shortly after the campaign. After spelling all that out, Schiff (rhetorically) asked this: "Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don't know. Not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out." Comey and Rogers would not comment. But we know what Democrats have concluded. 5. Republicans, meanwhile, want to focus on intelligence leaks to the press If Democrats' line of questioning focused on alleged Trump ties to Russia, Republicans zeroed in on charges that someone in the intelligence community was leaking these intelligence reports to the media. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., stressed that the leaks may have been politically motivated to weaken the Trump administration. This has the potential to be a major point of friction between Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee as it pursues its own investigation into Russian meddling: Should the committee put more effort into finding out who leaked the information than whether there is any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia? 6. Intelligence officials still don't think there's any evidence Russia's meddling directly influenced votes Early on, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, asked Rogers and Comey whether they had any evidence that Russia actually changed the vote tallies in key states. Both men said there is no evidence that Russian meddling actually changed votes, something they also said in a January Senate hearing. To some degree, the laser focus on vote tallies is a straw man argument, points out The Washington Post's Aaron Blake: It's nearly impossible to hack voting machines, and intelligence reports never implied that happened. But Republicans like Nunes also can't emphasize enough that Russia's meddling to help Trump win probably did not actually help Trump win. They do this to underscore the legitimacy of his presidency, yes, but also to get Trump to recognize his own legitimacy. Trump was originally hesitant to even acknowledge Russian meddling. He since has acknowledged it, but Republicans (and the intelligence community) need his full support to continue to investigate this, wherever it leads.

The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news and blamed on Democrats. In a bruising five-hour session, the FBI director also knocked down Trump's claim that his predecessor had wiretapped his New York skyscraper, an assertion that has distracted White House officials and frustrated fellow Republicans who acknowledge they've seen no evidence to support it. The revelation of the investigation of possible collusion with Russians, and the first public confirmation of the wider probe that began last summer, came in a remarkable hearing by one branch of government examining serious allegations against another branch and the new president's election campaign. Tight-lipped for the most part, Comey refused to offer details on the scope, targets or timeline for the FBI investigation, which could shadow the White House for months, if not years. The director would not say whether the probe has turned up evidence that Trump associates may have schemed with Russians during a campaign marked by email hacking that investigators believe was aimed at helping the Republican defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. "I can promise you," the FBI director vowed, "we will follow the facts wherever they lead." Comey for the first time put himself publicly at odds with the president by contradicting a series of recent tweets from Trump that asserted his phones had been ordered tapped by President Barack Obama during the campaign. "With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI," Comey said. The same was true, he added, of the Justice Department. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. His confirmation of the Russia-links investigation was striking given the FBI's historic reluctance to discuss its work. But Comey said the intense public interest in the matter — and permission from the Justice Department — made it appropriate to do so. Comey said the collusion inquiry began last July as part of a broader probe into Russian meddling in American politics, meaning Trump was elected president as associates remained under investigation for possible connections to Russia. Clinton allies on Monday contrasted Comey's silence during the campaign with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before Election Day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails. Many Democrats blame Comey's public updates with stoking worries about Clinton's trustworthiness and turning voters against her. Comey acknowledged that "some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances" where he and other officials were more open, but he said those were about concluded investigations. FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign. "I have no information that supports those tweets,'' said Comey, testifying at the House Intelligence... FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign. "I have no information that supports those tweets,'' said Comey, testifying at the House Intelligence... In the current case, it's not clear how long it will take for the FBI to decide if a crime was committed, but counterintelligence investigations are known for being complicated and time-intensive — and for frequently concluding without charges. Comey would not commit to a timetable. Regardless of the outcome, the investigation is unquestionably an unwelcome distraction for an administration that has struggled to move past questions about ties to Russia. The White House tried anew Monday to distance itself from two former senior members of Trump's team, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who have been under scrutiny for foreign contacts. Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Comey that revelations about the investigation had placed a "big gray cloud" over people trying to lead the country. "The faster you can get to the bottom of this, it's going to be better for all Americans," he said. Comey is the latest government official to reject Trump's claims, made without any evidence, that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters.. Nunes rejected them earlier in the hearing. Comey testified along with National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers, who also disputed allegations that British intelligence services could have been involved in such wiretapping. The White House last week pointed to a report of British involvement in an attempt to bolster the president's claim. The move only angered an ally. The hearing quickly divided along partisan lines, Democrats pressing for details on the status of the FBI's investigation while Republicans focused on news coverage and possible improper disclosures of classified information developed through surveillance. Trump took to Twitter before Monday's hearing began, accusing Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates. He said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Clinton instead. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" Trump tweeted early Monday as news coverage on the Russia allegations dominated the morning's cable news. The president continued to tweet throughout the hearing, creating an unusual public conversation between the embattled president and his FBI director. After Trump tweeted that the FBI and NSA had told Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process, Comey disputed that description. The FBI has offered no opinion and has no view and no information on the potential impact on the election because that's not something the bureau has looked at, he said. The president also claimed that Comey had said there was no evidence of collusion between his aides and Russia, though Comey said no such thing. Trump also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. U.S. intelligence officials have not publicly raised the possibility of contacts between the Clintons and Moscow. Officials have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Trump's election bid. The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, outlined a chronology that he said suggested frequent and troubling contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries. "Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than a entirely unhappy coincidence?" he asked rhetorically. "Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated."

Inside the White House, they are dismissed by their rivals as "the Democrats." Outspoken, worldly and polished, this coterie of ascendant Manhattan business figures-turned-presidential advisers is scrambling the still-evolving power centers swirling around President Donald Trump. Led by Gary Cohn and Dina Powell - two former Goldman Sachs executives often aligned with Trump's eldest daughter and son-in-law - the group and its broad network of allies are the targets of suspicion, loathing and jealousy from their more ideological West Wing colleagues. On the other side are the Republican populists driving much of Trump's nationalist agenda and confrontations, led by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who has become closer to chief of staff Reince Priebus in part to counter the New Yorkers. As Trump's administration enters its third month, the constant jockeying and backbiting among senior staff is further inflaming tensions at a time when the White House is struggling on numerous fronts - from the endangered health care bill to the controversial budget to the hundreds of top jobs still vacant throughout the government. The emerging turf war has led to fights over White House protocol and access to the president, leaks and backstabbing to reporters and a heated Oval Office showdown over trade refereed by the president himself. This account of the internal workings of Trump's team is based on interviews with 18 top White House officials, confidants of the president and other senior Republicans with knowledge of the relationships, many of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly. With President Donald Trump in his fourth full week in office, the upheaval inside the administration that West Wing officials had optimistically dismissed as growing pains is now cementing itself as standard operating procedure. Trump - distracted by political brushfires often of his own making... With President Donald Trump in his fourth full week in office, the upheaval inside the administration that West Wing officials had optimistically dismissed as growing pains is now cementing itself as standard operating procedure. Trump - distracted by political brushfires often of his own making... For the most part so far, the ideologues are winning. One revealing episode came as Trump weighed where he would travel last Wednesday following an auto industry event in Michigan. Would he jet to New York at the invitation of Canada's progressive hero, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to attend a Broadway performance of "Come From Away," a musical that showcases the generosity of foreigners? Or would he fly to Nashville, Tennessee, to dip his head in reverence at the gravesite of Andrew Jackson and yoke himself to the nationalist legacy of America's seventh president? Some of his New York-linked aides urged him to go to the play with Trudeau and Ivanka Trump, according to four senior Trump advisers. But Trump opted instead to follow his gut and heed Bannon's counsel. "Absolutely not," the president said later of going to the play, according to one of the advisers. Instead, Trump journeyed to Tennessee, where he laid a wreath at Jackson's tomb to celebrate what would have been the former president's 250th birthday and delivered a fiery speech. Trump aides pointed to his deliberation over what was a banal scheduling matter as an example of the Bannon-Priebus axis prevailing, as it has on many policy fronts - from national security to the budget to climate. "Trump's intention is to be Trump," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to the president. "Being tough on trade. Recentering the country on American nationalism. Taking on illegal immigration. Strengthening our military. Decentralizing the system. Radical reduction in regulations." He added, "It would be interesting to see to what degree the New York liberals change Trump and to what degree Trump changes the New York liberals." An unexpected political marriage has formed between Bannon and his network of anti-establishment, conservative populists, and Priebus, who represents a wing of more traditional Republican operatives. They are often at odds with the New Yorkers, led by Cohn and Powell, who are close to Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, arguably the most powerful White House aide. President Donald Trump speaks alongside Michelle DeLaune, center, of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Dina Powell, White House counselor, during a meeting on human trafficking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Feb. 23, 2017. President Donald Trump speaks alongside Michelle DeLaune, center, of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Dina Powell, White House counselor, during a meeting on human trafficking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Feb. 23, 2017. The lines can be blurred. Kushner and Cohn are particularly close with the Cabinet's industry barons - Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson - as well as Chris Liddell and Reed Cordish, two businessmen recruited by Kushner to work on long-term projects. Bannon and Priebus have their own relationships with those figures. Still, many people inside and outside the White House frequently note the growing visibility of Cohn and Powell and wonder if they might eventually gain influence over Trump's message and moderate it from Bannon-style populism, especially if the president's popularity wanes further. "They're more involved than ever," Larry Kudlow, a Trump ally and longtime CNBC economic analyst, said of the group. "Trump is instinctively drawn to them, but that doesn't mean he's losing his populist message. It means that in terms of day-to-day business and grinding out policy changes, he's drawn to the business people that are around him." Tensions between Bannon and Priebus ran hot in the early days of the presidency, suggesting that their outsider-versus-establishment feud would be the central division. But Priebus forged an alliance with Bannon, which they see as mutually beneficial because either or both could be sidelined should others, such as Cohn or Powell, ascend further, according to three White House officials. The tug at Trump forces near-daily decisions between following his tendency to gravitate towards those he considers highly successful in business and maintaining the combative political persona cheered by many conservatives.

Editor's Note: Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. After publication, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Post that Stephen Bannon did not travel to see Homeland... Internal competition has been a mainstay of every Trump enterprise. One top Trump adviser posited that, on a scale of one to 10, fighting between former aides Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort during the campaign would score an eight while that between the Cohn and Bannon blocs at the White House would be a two. The ongoing tension is real, this adviser said, but so far not debilitating: "We chose to hire a lot of alphas. People in politics are insecure and will either adapt to the fact that this is an entrepreneurial White House and survive, or they won't. The cream will rise and the [expletive] will sink." Sometimes when staffers feud, Kushner summons them to his office, a few doors down from the president's, where the 36-year-old adviser sits them on the couch and mediates as if he were a couple's therapist, officials said. Priebus said there were benefits to a staff with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds. "We have an incredible team that is talented, unified and focused on advancing the president's bold agenda," Priebus said in a statement. "The greatness of this team comes from the unique strengths each member brings to this administration." By most appearances, the New Yorkers are accumulating more power. Trump expanded Powell's portfolio this past week, naming her deputy national security adviser for strategy in addition to her post as senior counselor for economic initiatives. Born in Egypt and fluent in Arabic, Powell is taking on a more visible role in foreign affairs. At Friday's bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Powell sat two seats from Trump, with only Vice President Mike Pence between them. Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn walk down the West Wing Colonnade following a bilateral meeting Feb. 10, 2017, between President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House. Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn walk down the West Wing Colonnade following a bilateral meeting Feb. 10, 2017, between President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House. Powell has tapped the network she cultivated as a George W. Bush administration official and as president of Goldman's philanthropic foundation to invite guests for meetings with Trump. She dominated one such gathering on human trafficking, conversing with the authority of an expert, which impressed the president, aides said. Cohn, meanwhile, influences a wide range of policies domestic and foreign as director of the National Economic Council. Colleagues say he is opinionated and sharp-elbowed, walking between offices with the swagger befitting a banking titan. He is seen internally as a contender for chief of staff should Priebus exit, though one senior official noted, "Nobody wants Reince's job here. I can tell you that with certainty." Cohn and Powell huddle regularly with business executives, both on the White House campus and at glitzy off-site events. Several other senior staffers have groused that they are rarely invited to attend - and often don't know about them. Their networking creates what one associate called "a positive feedback loop": The executives often sing Cohn and Powell's praises in their meetings with Trump. Last month when two dozen manufacturing CEOs visited the White House, Trump paid no attention to Priebus - his actual chief of staff who was sitting at the table - but singled out Cohn by noting his vast wealth. "You all know Gary from Goldman," Trump said. "Gary Cohn - and we're really happy - just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way." The executives from such behemoths as General Electric and Johnson & Johnson laughed. Cohn is a registered Democrat, though he is known by many Republicans through his work at Goldman or summer parties at the Hamptons. In November 2015, Stephen Bannon - then the executive chairman of Breitbart News - was hosting a satellite radio show. His guest was Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who opposed President Barack Obama's plan to resettle some Syrian refugees in the United States. "We need to put a stop on refugees until...

Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who opposed President Barack Obama's plan to resettle some Syrian refugees in the United States. "We need to put a stop on refugees until... Trump enjoys having the rich and powerful reporting to him irrespective of their political affiliations, his associates said. This may be one of the reasons he reached out to Jonathan D. Gray, who manages a $100 billion-plus portfolio as global head of real estate at Blackstone Group, to discuss the job of Treasury secretary, even though Gray was a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's campaign. John Catsimatidis, a billionaire New York grocery magnate who has known Trump for decades, explained his friend's thinking by quoting from a Frank Sinatra song. "I don't want to blow my own horn, but remember the song, 'If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.. . .New York, New York!'" Catsimatidis asked. "It takes a little bit extra to make it in New York than anyplace else. Trump gets that." Impressing the president, however, has not necessarily translated into policy gains. The conservative wing - Bannon, Priebus, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and others - have notched victories in almost every sector, despite meetings Cohn and Powell have convened to promote a more centrist, business-friendly approach. "The president receives many different inputs, insights and ideas from a very diverse team of advisers, but it is clear to all that he is the ultimate decision maker," said Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor. "He's the president." Rather than embracing the Paris climate agreement, Trump has signaled his intent to roll back fuel-economy standards and proposed a budget last week that would effectively gut the Environmental Protection Agency. The health-care bill he backs strips federal funding for Planned Parenthood, while the proposed budget curbs funding for the arts and sciences. And he is pursuing aggressive policies on immigration. "Show me one New York win," a senior White House official said tauntingly. Said another official: "Donald trump is not the mayor of New York. Some of their ideas just don't have a national constituency." A competition over Trump's trade and economic agenda is brewing between Cohn and Peter Navarro, an eccentric academic and former campaign adviser close to Bannon who directs the National Trade Council. It came to a head two weeks ago in the Oval Office, where Cohn shrugged off Navarro's ideas as almost irrelevant, according to two officials. Trump stepped into the conversation and defended Navarro and his point of view. Priebus has been frustrated with Cohn and Powell for what he sees as short-circuiting his process by communicating directly with the president on a range of matters, officials said. Meanwhile, Cohn, Powell and other aides have chafed at Priebus's protocols because he and deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh tried to exert complete control over the president's daily schedule. "A bottleneck" is how one White House adviser described it. After being pressured to let up, this adviser said, Priebus recently started giving other senior staffers and Cabinet members more influence over which individuals and groups get face time with Trump. "The president wants 'w's' - he wants wins," Kudlow said. "That's key to understanding this bit of change in the whole outlook. He's trying to get 'w's' and have Congress work with him, and he's looking to lots of people to get them."

FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign. "I have no information that supports those tweets,'' said Comey, testifying at the House Intelligence Committee's first public hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. "We have looked carefully inside the FBI,'' and agents found nothing to support those claims, he said. The hearing comes amid the controversy fired up by Trump more than two weeks ago when he tweeted, without providing evidence, that President Barack Obama had ordered his phones tapped at Trump Tower. Under questioning from the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, Comey said no president could order such surveillance. He added that the Justice Department had asked him to also tell the committee that that agency has no such information, either. Comey also acknowledged the existence of a counterintelligence investigation into the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, and said that probe extends to the nature of any links between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government. Comey said the investigation is also exploring whether there was any coordination between the campaign and the Kremlin, and "whether any crimes were committed." The acknowledgment was an unusual move, given that the FBI's practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations. "But in unusual circumstances, where it is in the public interest," Comey said, "it may be appropriate to do so." The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... Comey said he had been authorized by the Justice Department to confirm the wide-ranging probe's existence. He spoke at the intelligence committee hearing along with National Security Agency head Michael S. Rogers. Comey and Rogers predicted Russian intelligence agencies will continue to seek to meddle with U.S. political campaigns, because they view their work in the 2016 presidential race as successful. "They'll be back in 2020, they may be back in 2018,'' Comey said. "One of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful, introducing chaos and discord" into the electoral process. "It's possible they're misreading that as 'it worked,' so we'll come back and hit them again in 2020," Comey added. Rogers agreed: "I fully expect they will maintain this level of activity." And, he said, Moscow is conducting a similar "active measures" campaign in Europe, where France and Germany are holding elections this year. President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates' contact with Russia during the presidential election, and said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Hillary Clinton instead. His tweets came just hours before... President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates' contact with Russia during the presidential election, and said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Hillary Clinton instead. His tweets came just hours before... Trump and the committee's Republicans seemed most exercised by leaks to the media. Information shared with the press has resulted in a series of stories over the last month and a half about contacts Trump administration officials or close associates had with Russian officials. One story in particular that apparently upset the Republicans was a Feb. 9 piece by The Washington Post reporting that Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, discussed the subject of sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, in the month before Trump took office. The Post reported that the discussions were monitored under routine, court-approved monitoring of Kislyak's calls. Flynn, who had denied to Vice President Pence that he had spoken about sanctions, was forced to resign. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., suggested that the leaks were political. He asked Comey if the intelligence community had shared such information with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, or Obama. Comey, who had acknowledged that in general senior officials, including Lynch, would have access to such information, said he would not comment on his conversations with Obama or Trump. As the hearing was going on - in an apparent dig at Comey and carrying the suggestion that Obama administration officials were behind the leaks - Trump's presidential Twitter account tweeted out "FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia." Just hours before the start of the hearing, Trump posted a series of tweets claiming Democrats "made up" the allegations of Russian contacts in an attempt to discredit the GOP during the presidential campaign. Trump also urged federal investigators to shift their focus to probe disclosures of classified material. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information," Trump wrote early Monday. "Must find leaker now!" Nunes sought an admission from the officials that the leaks were illegal under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court act, the law that governs foreign intelligence-gathering on U.S. soil or of U.S. persons overseas. "Yes," Comey answered. "In addition to being a breach of our trust with the FISA court." Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., pressed Rogers to clarify under what circumstances it would be legitimate for Americans caught on tape speaking with people under surveillance to have their identities disclosed publicly, and whether leaking those identities would "hurt or help" intelligence collection. "Hurt," Rogers noted. Rogers stressed that the identities of U.S. persons picked up through "incidental collection" - that being the way intelligence officials picked up on Flynn's phone calls with Kislyak - are disclosed only on a "valid, need to know" basis, and usually only when there is a criminal activity or potential threat to the United States at play. Rogers added that there are a total of 20 people in the NSA he has delegated to make decisions about when someone's identity can be unmasked. Comey did confirm that the NSA, CIA, FBI, main Justice Department and others - including personnel in the White House in some situations - could have access to unmasked names of U.S. persons. But he stressed that only the collecting agency can unmask the identities of people. Others with whom the information is shared "can ask the collectors to unmask," he said - but can't do it on their own. GOP members fretted that the leaks to the media would complicate the effort by lawmakers to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to collect through U.S. companies general categories of foreign intelligence contained in phone calls, emails and other electronic communications when one end of the communication is overseas. Comey rejected the suggestion. "This conversation has nothing to do with 702," he protested. "702 is about targeting non-U.S. persons overseas. The FBI can apply to collect electronic surveillance in the United States [on individual targets], but it's a different thing from 702." Comey declined to say whether any officials had sought approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor anyone in the Trump campaign, saying he did not want to discuss the workings of the highly secretive court. Individuals familiar with the investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, have said there was no such request made during the campaign. The FBI probe combines an investigation into hacking operations by Russian spy agencies with efforts to understand how the Kremlin sought to manipulate public opinion and influence the election's outcome In January, the intelligence community released a report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to not only undermine the legitimacy of the election process but also harm the campaign of Hillary Clinton and boost Trump's chances of winning. Hackers working for Russian spy agencies penetrated the computers of the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and 2016 as well as the email accounts of Democratic officials, intelligence official said in the report. The material was relayed to WikiLeaks, the officials said, and the anti-secrecy group began a series of damaging email releases just before the Democratic National Convention that continued through the fall.

Devin Nunes once said all he wanted to do was work on a dairy farm. Now the man from the rural Central Valley of California is running one of the most scrutinized, complex and politically fraught congressional investigations in recent memory. As chairman of the House intelligence committee, which holds its first public hearing on Monday, Nunes is at the helm of a probe of Moscow's meddling in the 2016 campaign and the murky web of contacts between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. It's a potentially sprawling enterprise that spans continents, plumbs spycraft and dominates international headlines. He's a long way from raising cattle. "I'm not asking for any profile," Nunes told the Associated Press, when asked about his new place in the spotlight. Until recently, the soft-spoken 43-year-old — dubbed a "normal dad" by friends — was hardly a fixture on the national news circuit. Now he is holding weekly press briefings and being asked to weigh in on daily twists and unexpected developments. At Monday's hearing he will call FBI Director James Comey as a witness, an event that amounts to must-see television in Washington. Nunes was not an early Trump backer, but was named to the transition team as an adviser on appointments. The burden of leading a bipartisan, credible investigation into the integrity of the U.S. campaigns, not to mention the possible role of the new president's campaign associates, is a heavy one not only for him but for many veteran lawmakers. After six weeks spent scrambling to fend off chaos, the Trump White House has found itself in territory familiar to several past administrations: trying to pursue a sense of normality as it conducts an investigation into itself. The decision by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from supervising... After six weeks spent scrambling to fend off chaos, the Trump White House has found itself in territory familiar to several past administrations: trying to pursue a sense of normality as it conducts an investigation into itself. The decision by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from supervising... On the other side of the aisle, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, of Virginia, has said the Senate intelligence committee investigation, which he is co-leading, is probably the most important thing he will do in his public life. Nunes says he does not feel the same way. "Everything we do around here is really important," Nunes said. "I wouldn't put one in front of the other." It's an understatement his friends recognize. Nunes is a third-generation Portuguese-American, and he grew up working on his family's dairy farm. As a teenager, he raised cattle and saved money to buy farmland with his brother, according to his congressional biography. He has degrees in agriculture and keeps his hand in farming through an investment in two California wineries run by a friend he met through his alumni network. Rep. David Valadao, a Republican congressman from a district next to Nunes' and fellow dairyman, said Nunes takes his job as congressman seriously. But, he said, aside from his work, "he's a normal dad" to three young daughters. "All I wanted to be was a dairy farmer," Nunes told a group of high school students as he campaigned for his seat in Congress in 2002, according to an article in the Fresno Bee. His education and childhood aspiration suited his political ambitions. Like many politicians from California's interior farm belt, Nunes was well versed in agriculture and the water supply that supports it. Nunes' first entree into politics was as a member of the board of a local community college. He ran for Congress in 1998 and lost in the primary. In 2001, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to a California post at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He was only 28 when he won a hotly contested congressional seat, beating his Republican competitors in the 2002 primary by appealing to the concerns of ranchers and dairymen in his solidly conservative district. Thousands of miles from here, the Kremlin is denying accusations that it meddled in the U.S. presidential election. But in this town of rolling farmland and main streets shaded by grain elevators, the barrage of news coming out about the Trump's administrations ties to Russia has fallen on mostly... Thousands of miles from here, the Kremlin is denying accusations that it meddled in the U.S. presidential election. But in this town of rolling farmland and main streets shaded by grain elevators, the barrage of news coming out about the Trump's administrations ties to Russia has fallen on mostly... Tom Barcellos, a Tulare County dairy producer who has known Nunes since he was a child, said Nunes was focused early on politics, without being showy. "He knew what he wanted and he did his research, and he didn't blow a lot of smoke," Barcellos said. Nunes consistently has supported bills that would roll back environmental protections and boost federal water supplies to the fertile farmlands of the San Joaquin Valley, the lower stretch of California's vast Central Valley. His ongoing fight against what he describes as jobs-killing regulations promoted by "radical environmentalists" is a priority shared by a local group of wealthy farmers who belong to the giant Westlands Water District, which hired Nunes' friend and former chief of staff as its deputy general manager two years ago. "Devin, from day one, has made water his top priority," said Tom Holyoke, a political scientist at California State University, Fresno. Nunes served on the Agriculture Committee during his first term, but quickly landed a spot on the House Ways and Means Committee, one of Congress' most influential panels. He was spotted by Republican leaders as a party loyalist and he was named to a leadership position during his first term. He vied for the chairmanship of the intelligence committee in 2014. While competing against more senior members, he proved a better fundraiser, bringing in far more money for his party than his competitors for the chairmanship. While many congressional committee leadership positions are based on seniority, the House intelligence committee leadership was chosen by then-House Speaker John Boehner. Nunes has suggested he pursued the intelligence committee post because it would be good for his constituents. Intelligence can play a key role in trade negotiations, he said, although it is only a sliver of the intelligence agencies' missions. "The intelligence committee — that's a committee that I call the tip of the spear, because without national security it's tough to keep those trade routes open," Nunes said in a 2014 interview with the Tulare Advance-Register. Until now, much of Nunes' work on the committee has been focused on investigations into NSA leaker Edward Snowden, the intelligence behind the Iran nuclear deal, Hillary Clinton's emails and the placement of a Defense Department intelligence center. The congressman made a push to have the center built on the Azores islands, 800 miles off the coast of Portugal, a proposal that was popular among the valley's many dairy producers of Portuguese descent. The department ultimately chose a site in the U.K. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes denied on Monday morning that there was any evidence from the intelligence community of contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives. "As of right now, I don't have any evidence of any phone calls. It doesn't mean they don't... House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes denied on Monday morning that there was any evidence from the intelligence community of contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives. "As of right now, I don't have any evidence of any phone calls. It doesn't mean they don't... Monday's hearing will be the latest spotlight on the tension between Nunes' loyalty to Trump and his commitment to a thorough, bipartisan investigation. The congressman's independence has already been questioned. Last month, the White House enlisted him to push back on a news article it didn't like about Trump associates' ties to Russia. The congressman has said he did nothing improper when he reached out to a reporter. Nunes has not appeared to relish the role of Trump defender. He's described Trump as a "political neophyte." Asked about Trump's tweeted claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones, Nunes' response did little to help quiet the controversy. "Are you going to take the tweets literally?" Nunes said. "If so, clearly the president was wrong." Burke reported from San Francisco. Researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report.

The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction," Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman, said on "Fox News Sunday." He added, "There was no FISA warrant that I'm aware of to tap Trump Tower" - a reference to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a federal law that governs the issuance of search warrants in U.S. intelligence gathering. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the panel's top Democrat, said, "We are at the bottom of this: There is nothing at the bottom." Nunes and Schiff spoke a day before his panel holds its first public hearing on alleged Russian attempts to interfere in last year's presidential election - a subject that is certain to include discussion of contacts between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned last month after it was revealed that he had privately discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office. Schiff, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," said he expected FBI Director James B. Comey to testify clearly at the hearing that there is no factual basis for Trump's wiretapping claims. "I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase, because what the president said was just patently false," the Democrat said. "It's continuing to grow in terms of damage, and he needs to put an end to this." President Donald Trump defiantly refused to back down Friday from his explosive claim that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones, and sidestepped any blame for the White House decision to highlight an unverified report that Britain helped carry out the alleged surveillance. In brushing off the diplomatic... President Donald Trump defiantly refused to back down Friday from his explosive claim that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones, and sidestepped any blame for the White House decision to highlight an unverified report that Britain helped carry out the alleged surveillance. In brushing off the diplomatic... The two House leaders did not agree, however, on whether the question of collusion between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives has been settled. Nunes said the new Justice Department documents, submitted in response to a congressional request, included "no evidence of collusion" to swing the election in Trump's favor and repeated previous statements that there is no credible proof that there was any active coordination. The lawmaker said he remained primarily concerned about leaks of U.S. surveillance of conversations between Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. "That's the only crime we know has been committed right now," Nunes said. But Schiff said there was "circumstantial evidence of collusion" at the outset of the congressional investigations into purported Russian election meddling, as well as "direct evidence" that Trump campaign figures sought to deceive the public about their interactions with Russian figures. President Donald Trump's explosive allegation that Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the presidential campaign has left him increasingly isolated, with allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration offering no evidence to back him up. On Wednesday, Attorney General... President Donald Trump's explosive allegation that Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the presidential campaign has left him increasingly isolated, with allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration offering no evidence to back him up. On Wednesday, Attorney General... "Of course, there's one thing to say there's evidence; there's another thing to say we can prove this or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt," he said. "But there was certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation. The American people have a right to know, and in order to defend ourselves, we need to know whether the circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception is indicative of more." Trump last week refused to back down from his tweets on March 4 that claimed President Barack Obama "had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory" and compared it to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. But no credible evidence has emerged to support those claims, and the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said last week that they have seen nothing that supports the allegation. In a Fox News Channel interview on Thursday, Trump said, "I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks." Nunes said Trump could be referring to new information about whether intelligence officials "unmasked," or identified, U.S. citizens who were captured speaking with foreign officials who are under routine surveillance - a process governed by FISA. "That is very possible, and we don't have the answers to those questions yet," he said. "We had a deadline of Friday for the NSA, FBI and CIA to get us those names that were unmasked through the FISA system. We didn't get those names on Friday, and until we get those names, we can't rule this out." He added that Monday's hearing was "just the beginning" and that he planned to continue looking into who revealed Flynn's communications with Kislyak. "We're trying to get to everyone who, for lack of a better term, was at the crime scene," he said. "We're trying to bring them all in, see what they knew, when they knew it, if they knew about the leaks, if they knew about General Flynn's name being unmasked. These are all questions that we need to get to the bottom of." Trump remains under pressure from members of his own party to back off his claims of illegal wiretapping - particularly after the furor intensified last week when White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that British intelligence may have played a role in the surveillance. Spicer later apologized for the claim and explained that he had repeated an unverified media report. On ABC's "This Week," another Republican on the House Intelligence Committee called on Trump to apologize for accusing Obama of ordering an illegal wiretap. "To quote my 85-year-old father … it never hurts to say you're sorry," said Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a former clandestine agent for the CIA. "I think it helps with our allies. We've got to make sure that we're all working together. We live in a very dangerous world, and we can't do this alone. … It's not just sorry to the president, but also to the U.K. for the claims or the intimation that the U.K. was involved in this, as well. It doesn't hurt. And it takes away from the rest of his agenda." Hurd said that "some folks will probably be frustrated" by the hearing Monday because the officials set to testify, including Comey, might not be able to elaborate on investigative matters: "There may be an active investigation going on, a criminal investigation. And if there's an active criminal investigation, we need to allow law enforcement … do their job." In a separate interview on "This Week," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., focused on the leak of Flynn's communications with Kislyak and said those within the federal government who might have been responsible should undergo lie-detector tests. "It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to the New York Times," Paul said. "There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie-detector tests. And, I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well." Paul said, using a term increasingly favored by conservatives for members of the federal bureaucracy, "You will get a 'deep state.' You will have an intelligence community that has enormous power if that happens." Hurd, however, pushed back on the notion that a deep state was seeking to undermine Trump. He said, "I spent 9 1/2 years as an undercover officer. I was the dude in the back alleys at 4 in the morning collecting intelligence to protect our homeland. … The men and the women in the CIA, they do their job regardless of who is in the White House. Same for NSA. Same for FBI. These men and women are putting themselves in harm's way." If true, the alleged campaign of political interference by Russia, Hurd said, would "go down in the history of Mother Russia as the greatest covert action campaign" it had ever pursued. "It created a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the White House, the intelligence community and the American public," he said. "And that's why, as we go through this review and investigation, it has to be bipartisan. It has to be thorough. And it has to be thoughtful, because we are feeding into this covert-action narrative that the Russians are trying to create."

FBI Director James B. Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will appear Monday before the House Intelligence Committee to speak about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential connections between President Donald Trump's inner circle and the Kremlin. It is the first time Comey and Rogers have testified publicly since Trump took office two months ago - a period during which Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from Trump-related investigations. In recent weeks, Trump joined the fray with counter-accusations of his own, such as his unfounded charge that the Obama administration conducted a wiretap of his phones at Trump Tower in New York. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee confirmed on "Fox News Sunday" that there was no evidence to suggest that Trump was wiretapped. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he has seen Justice Department documents requested by the panel confirming that information; they were turned over to his committee Friday. "Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction," Nunes said. The Intelligence Committee hearing is the opening foray into getting public answers on these topics. On March 28, former spy chiefs and administration officials will also appear before the panel to give their take on what, if anything, transpired between Trump's team and Russian officials during the heat of the presidential campaign. But even as intelligence officials publicly answer lawmakers' questions, political jockeying is casting a cloud over efforts to probe how deep the counterintelligence investigation involving the president's inner circle really goes. Here are five things to watch at Monday's House Intelligence Committee hearing, which begins at 10 a.m.: 1. Can Republicans stop the bleeding? Can Democrats unearth a smoking gun? Republicans have been scrambling to help the president avoid the specter of scandal since allegations first surfaced about contacts between Trump's team and Russian officials. Nunes has repeatedly said he believes there is no evidence of improper contact, taking pains to shift the focus of the investigation toward ferreting out who leaked information about such contacts to the media - saying that the leaks are the only "major crimes" that occurred. But Trump complicated Republicans' efforts with his insistence that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower - an assertion GOP leaders could not, and did not try, to defend. In recent days, some influential Republicans have even called on Trump to apologize to former president Barack Obama. Democrats have yet to find a smoking gun firmly establishing that the president, or his top surrogates, colluded with Russian authorities to swing the election in Trump's favor. That is a tall order, based on the conversations thus far disclosed: Flynn and Sessions bowed out of their roles because they had misled the vice president and lawmakers, respectively, not because they admitted to discussing anything improper with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Expect Democrats to focus on links not just between people who served in Trump's administration and Russian authorities, but also between top campaign surrogates such as former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Carter Page, who have had financial and business ties to Russians and their allies. 2. Will Comey admit to an investigation? News outlets have reported that the FBI and the Justice Department are conducting probes into the allegations surrounding Russia, the 2016 elections and the Trump team. But Comey has yet to admit to this publicly on Capitol Hill. His silence - predicated on his insistence that he never comments on ongoing investigations - has irked members of both parties and invited bipartisan charges that Comey is stonewalling Congress. Democrats allege that perhaps Comey is biased: They say he was perfectly willing to talk about Hillary Clinton's emails - though Comey says he commented in that case because it was a closed investigation. Others have said the director is simply being uncooperative. Some of that vitriol has lessened in recent days, after Comey arrived on Capitol Hill to brief the Gang of Eight - senior lawmakers who receive Congress's highest-level intelligence briefings - on matters related to Russia. Members also secured a promise from the intelligence community that committee members will be privy to the same information provided to the Gang of Eight, a concession lawmakers say is necessary for them to conduct their investigation. Still, many members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have been clamoring for Comey to publicly state that the investigation exists and is ongoing - and members of the House Intelligence Committee are likely to use Monday's forum to challenge him to answer that question. 3. Is it just about wiretapping - or could there be other surveillance involved? We now know that the Justice Department had no information to back up Trump's claim that the Obama administration was tapping his phones in Trump Tower. Comey had been pushing the Justice Department to come clean about that for awhile. What we still do not know, though, is whether there were wiretaps of Trump's affiliates outside the tower - or, in the course of other investigations, whether the intelligence community picked up on communications the president or his team had with Russia during the campaign or the transition period. This sort of "incidental collection" has already helped to take down one member of Trump's team - Flynn, caught on tape speaking with Kislyak, whose communications were being watched. Nunes has suggested there could be others popping up in such indirect surveillance - possibly even the president himself. The House Intelligence Committee is still waiting on answers to a request for a complete list of names of people who have been "unmasked" during surveillance operations. Committee leaders announced Friday that the NSA "partially" responded to their request for that list. But the FBI and CIA have not. A complete list is not likely to make it to lawmakers' hands before Monday morning, so expect a few questions on this subject. And remember: Though Nunes has laid to rest speculation the government bugged the phones of Trump Tower, he has not yet commented on whether there were wiretaps of others connected to Trump, outside the tower. The committee's request covered a very wide range of individuals - including Trump's business associates, his relatives and his friends. Look for members to grill Comey and Rogers for a fuller reckoning. 4. Will Republicans cross the White House? An investigation that began as a probe focused on allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections has expanded - and not just to include whether Russian authorities had direct contacts with campaign officials. The investigation now encompasses going after leakers in the administration for publicizing the information linking Trump surrogates to Kremlin officials. It also includes the query about incidental collection, to see whether the intelligence community adhered closely to the law as it was doing its job. In this highly charged atmosphere, where members choose to direct their questions for Comey and Rogers could reveal a great deal about where they stand. Democrats will undoubtedly focus on the potential connections between the Trump team and Russia. But watch Republicans: Those who pursue similar questions will be knowingly and openly crossing the White House. It is far safer for Republicans to focus on questions about leaks, which are what the Trump team - and Nunes - say are the real crime. Still, the GOP is not united around Trump here. As Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said a month ago: "All of us know that leaks happen in this town, and we all don't like it - but the fact is that you now have a much larger issue to address." 5. Where do we go from here? The pomp and circumstance surrounding this hearing is considerable - and understandable, given the investigation, the politics surrounding it and the guest list. But how much new information will we really learn? The answer may be not much at all. Comey has been very careful about what he says publicly and privately on this matter. More than once, he has come to the Hill for closed-door briefings and members have emerged frustrated - in a public hearing, the FBI director is even less likely to cut loose. Rogers is a bit chattier - but also not likely to divulge state secrets or say anything revealing how the investigation is being conducted, for fear of unmasking sources, methods and classified procedures central to the investigation. It is unlikely that lawmakers will succeed in getting something shocking, or damning, or even conclusive out of the duo. But as we have seen, the investigation can turn dramatically on unsubstantiated tweets from the president, and anything could happen.

President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates' contact with Russia during the presidential election, and said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Hillary Clinton instead. His tweets came just hours before a potentially politically damaging hearing in which FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers planned to testify on allegations of Russian hacking and whether there were any connections between Moscow and Trump's campaign. "The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" Trump tweeted early Monday, as news coverage on the Russia allegations dominated the morning's cable news. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" He also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. U.S. intelligence officials have not publicly raised the possibility of contacts between the Clintons and Moscow. Officials investigating the matter have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Trump's election bid. "What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians?" he tweeted. "Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?" Monday's hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, one of several congressional panels probing allegations of Russian meddling, could allow for the greatest public accounting to date of investigations that have shadowed the Trump administration in its first two months. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in the campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. The FBI has also been investigating ties between Russia and Trump advisers and associates during the campaign. The top two lawmakers on the House intelligence committee said Sunday that documents the Justice Department and FBI delivered late last week offered no evidence that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, the president's New York City headquarters. But the panel's ranking Democrat says the material offers circumstantial evidence that American citizens colluded with Russians in Moscow's efforts to interfere in the presidential election. "There was circumstantial evidence of collusion; there is direct evidence, I think, of deception," Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on NBC's "Meet the Press." ''There's certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation." Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, said: "For the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses." The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was... The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was... "We know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They're also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and over in Europe," he said on "Fox News Sunday." The Senate Intelligence Committee has scheduled a similar hearing for later in the month. It is not clear how much new information will emerge Monday, and the hearing's open setting unquestionably puts Comey in a difficult situation if he's asked to discuss an ongoing investigation tied to the campaign of the president. At a hearing in January, Comey refused to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation exploring possible connections between Trump associates and Russia, consistent with the FBI's longstanding policy of not publicly discussing its work. His appearances on Capitol Hill since then have occurred in classified settings, often with small groups of lawmakers, and he has made no public statements connected to the Trump campaign or Russia. But Comey may feel compelled to respond to Trump's unproven Twitter assertions that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretapping of Trump Tower during the campaign. Congressional leaders briefed on the matter have said they've seen no indication that that's true, and Obama's top intelligence official, James Clapper, has publicly called the claims false. The Justice Department's disclosure Friday that it had complied with congressional demands for information regarding Trump's wiretapping tweets could allow Comey to avoid questioning by simply saying that the lawmakers already have the information they requested. Yet any lack of detail from Comey will likely be contrasted with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before Election Day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails.

The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news and blamed on Democrats. In a bruising five-hour session, the FBI director also knocked down Trump's claim that his predecessor had wiretapped his New York skyscraper, an assertion that has distracted White House officials and frustrated fellow Republicans who acknowledge they've seen no evidence to support it. The revelation of the investigation of possible collusion with Russians, and the first public confirmation of the wider probe that began last summer, came in a remarkable hearing by one branch of government examining serious allegations against another branch and the new president's election campaign. Tight-lipped for the most part, Comey refused to offer details on the scope, targets or timeline for the FBI investigation, which could shadow the White House for months, if not years. The director would not say whether the probe has turned up evidence that Trump associates may have schemed with Russians during a campaign marked by email hacking that investigators believe was aimed at helping the Republican defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. "I can promise you," the FBI director vowed, "we will follow the facts wherever they lead." Comey for the first time put himself publicly at odds with the president by contradicting a series of recent tweets from Trump that asserted his phones had been ordered tapped by President Barack Obama during the campaign. "With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI," Comey said. The same was true, he added, of the Justice Department. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. His confirmation of the Russia-links investigation was striking given the FBI's historic reluctance to discuss its work. But Comey said the intense public interest in the matter — and permission from the Justice Department — made it appropriate to do so. Comey said the collusion inquiry began last July as part of a broader probe into Russian meddling in American politics, meaning Trump was elected president as associates remained under investigation for possible connections to Russia. Clinton allies on Monday contrasted Comey's silence during the campaign with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before Election Day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails. Many Democrats blame Comey's public updates with stoking worries about Clinton's trustworthiness and turning voters against her. Comey acknowledged that "some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances" where he and other officials were more open, but he said those were about concluded investigations. FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign. "I have no information that supports those tweets,'' said Comey, testifying at the House Intelligence... FBI Director James Comey on Monday said there is "no information" that supports President Donald Trump's claims that his predecessor ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the election campaign. "I have no information that supports those tweets,'' said Comey, testifying at the House Intelligence... In the current case, it's not clear how long it will take for the FBI to decide if a crime was committed, but counterintelligence investigations are known for being complicated and time-intensive — and for frequently concluding without charges. Comey would not commit to a timetable. Regardless of the outcome, the investigation is unquestionably an unwelcome distraction for an administration that has struggled to move past questions about ties to Russia. The White House tried anew Monday to distance itself from two former senior members of Trump's team, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who have been under scrutiny for foreign contacts. Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Comey that revelations about the investigation had placed a "big gray cloud" over people trying to lead the country. "The faster you can get to the bottom of this, it's going to be better for all Americans," he said. Comey is the latest government official to reject Trump's claims, made without any evidence, that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters.. Nunes rejected them earlier in the hearing. Comey testified along with National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers, who also disputed allegations that British intelligence services could have been involved in such wiretapping. The White House last week pointed to a report of British involvement in an attempt to bolster the president's claim. The move only angered an ally. The hearing quickly divided along partisan lines, Democrats pressing for details on the status of the FBI's investigation while Republicans focused on news coverage and possible improper disclosures of classified information developed through surveillance. Trump took to Twitter before Monday's hearing began, accusing Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates. He said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Clinton instead. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" Trump tweeted early Monday as news coverage on the Russia allegations dominated the morning's cable news. The president continued to tweet throughout the hearing, creating an unusual public conversation between the embattled president and his FBI director. After Trump tweeted that the FBI and NSA had told Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process, Comey disputed that description. The FBI has offered no opinion and has no view and no information on the potential impact on the election because that's not something the bureau has looked at, he said. The president also claimed that Comey had said there was no evidence of collusion between his aides and Russia, though Comey said no such thing. Trump also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. U.S. intelligence officials have not publicly raised the possibility of contacts between the Clintons and Moscow. Officials have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Trump's election bid. The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, outlined a chronology that he said suggested frequent and troubling contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries. "Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than a entirely unhappy coincidence?" he asked rhetorically. "Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated."

President Donald Trump produced a running commentary Monday on FBI Director James Comey's testimony to Congress. Thanks to the length of the hearing and the immediacy of Twitter, Comey was able to comment on the president's commentary without leaving his seat. On whether Russia influenced the 2016 election TRUMP tweet: "The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process." THE FACTS: No such assurance was offered by Comey or his fellow witness at the hearing, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. They did not offer any conclusions about whether Russia succeeded in influencing the election. COMEY: Asked about the tweet while he was still testifying, he voiced "no opinion" on Russia's influence. "We have no information on that subject," he said. "It's not something we looked at." He confirmed, though, that the FBI is investigating whether and how Russia tried to shape the election, a probe he says includes any potential coordination between Trump campaign associates and Russia's government. The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... On whether Comey briefed President Obama on Michael Flynn TRUMP tweet: "FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia." THE FACTS: "Refuses to deny" is true, but perhaps misleading. Throughout the hearing, Comey declined to deny any assertion made by his questioners that mentioned Flynn or any other individuals, explaining that the FBI is not in the business of correcting or verifying such reports. Flynn helped Trump in the campaign, became national security adviser at the start of Trump's presidency and was fired after he was found to have misled senior members of the administration about his contacts with Russia's top diplomat to the U.S. On whether there is evidence of collusion with Russia TRUMP tweet: "FBI Director Comey: fmr. DNI Clapper 'right' to say no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump Campaign." THE FACTS: Trump leaves out an important nuance in this tweet about the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Comey agreed there was no evidence of collusion in a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community under Clapper, but that's different than saying no such evidence has been discovered. Before FBI Director James Comey began his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, President Donald Trump was back, compulsively tweeting — and underscoring the growing perception that his allegation that President Barack Obama had Trump's "wires tapped" is nonsensical, his attachment... Before FBI Director James Comey began his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, President Donald Trump was back, compulsively tweeting — and underscoring the growing perception that his allegation that President Barack Obama had Trump's "wires tapped" is nonsensical, his attachment... The Jan. 6 report does not take up the question of contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Instead it focuses on Russia's actions, via cyber operations and propaganda, to try to help Trump's election chances and hurt Hillary Clinton's. Clapper indeed said he had seen no evidence of collusion at the time he left government. But he updated that comment Monday with a statement from spokesman Shawn Turner, saying Clapper "could not account for intelligence or evidence that may have been gathered since the inauguration on January 20th." COMEY, when asked if he was aware of collusion between Trump associates and Russia, beyond the findings of the report: "It's not something I can comment on." ROGERS: "Likewise, I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation's conclusions."

President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump's remarks came at the top of what was billed as a "listening session" at which he sat at a conference table in the Roosevelt Room with a group of African-Americans, most of whom had played a role in his campaign for president or worked on the transition. Trump soon turned to a false report by a Time magazine writer that on his Inauguration Day a bust of King had been removed from the Oval Office. Trump and his aides have repeatedly cited the incident as evidence of media bias, despite an immediate acknowledgment of the error and an apology from the reporter. "Somebody said I took the statue out of my office," Trump said. "And it turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. The statue is cherished. . . . It was never even touched, so I think it was a disgrace, but that's the way the press is. Very unfortunate." Trump later said that he didn't watch CNN, calling the network "fake news." By contrast, he said, "Fox has treated me very nice." Trump also repeated an earlier assessment, first made by White House strategist Stephen Bannon, that the media is "the opposition party." "A lot of the media actually is the opposition party," the president said. "They're so biased, and really it's a disgrace. Some of the media is fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party, knowingly saying incorrect things." Violence in Chicago remains stubbornly high as the city recorded about the same number of homicides and shootings in January as the year-earlier period, according to statistics released Wednesday by the Police Department.

Violence in Chicago remains stubbornly high as the city recorded about the same number of homicides and shootings in January as the year-earlier period, according to statistics released Wednesday by the Police Department. Much of the violence remains concentrated in three police districts — Englewood... Trump noted he had won the election, suggesting that that was evidence the media might not "have the influence they think." "But they really need to straighten out their act," Trump said. "They're very dishonest people." During the event, Trump also thanked those around the table for helping him exceed his expectations with African-American voters. "If you remember, I wasn't going to do well with the African-American community," Trump said. "We ended up getting substantially more than candidates who had run in the past years, and now we're going to take that to new levels." Exit polls showed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly won African-American votes over Trump, 89 percent to 8 percent. In 2012, exit polls showed that then-President Barack Obama garnered 93 percent of the black vote compared with Republican nominee Mitt Romney's 6 percent. Trump profusely thanked Ben Carson, his pick to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for his help during the campaign. President Trump urged Senate Republican leaders Wednesday to be prepared to tear up the rules of the Senate and "go nuclear" if Democrats try to block his Supreme Court nominee from winning confirmation - complicating the beginning of Judge Neil Gorsuch's delicate courtship of the lawmakers who...

"I'd go around with Ben to a lot of different places I wasn't so familiar with," Trump said. Trump also put in a plug for the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, ticking off a number of those honored there. Among those he mentioned was Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist and former slave who died in 1895. Trump cited Douglass as "an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice." "Big impact," Trump said of those featured in the museum. "I'm proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more," Trump said.

President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for national security adviser partnered in recent months with a technology company co-led by a businessman who pleaded guilty to trying to sell stolen scientific material in the 1980s to the KGB, the former Soviet intelligence service. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn joined the advisory board of Brainwave Science in February, company documents show. The Massachusetts firm develops controversial "brain fingerprinting" technology designed to assess whether people under interrogation are being truthful by measuring their brain waves. The firm offers training in how to use the technology, in partnership with Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, according to Brainwave's website. One of Brainwave's two-member board of directors was Sabu Kota, an Indian-born software engineer who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to an FBI agent posing as a Soviet spy. Prosecutors said the sale stemmed from what they called Kota's involvement in a spy ring that passed sensitive defense technology to the KGB between 1985 and 1990, according to a Defense Department summary of the case. A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents... A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents... Brainwave Science removed Kota's name from the company website sometime between Thursday and Friday, when Bloomberg News published a report about Flynn's ties to the firm, according to a search of archived Google data. Company officials and officials from Trump's transition team did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, and Kota did not respond to messages left at his home. Kota's lawyer denied that he had any connection to spying when he was charged in 1995, and Kota told Bloomberg that the criminal charges were a misunderstanding and stemmed from a patent dispute, not espionage. Bloomberg also quoted a Trump transition official as saying that Flynn had no dealings with Kota during his time working with Brainwave and that he has ended his association with the firm. The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... The connection between Flynn - a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency - and the company is the latest controversy involving relations between Russia and Trump or members of his team. Trump has faced criticism for expressing his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on Friday the president-elect released what he called "a very nice letter" from the Russian leader. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Putin at a lavish gala for the state-run channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make. Former U.S. officials said Flynn, seen dining next to Putin in photos published by Russian outlets, was used as a prop by the autocratic leader. Flynn defended the trip, saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN, and that he had pressed Putin's government to behave more responsibly in international affairs. The length and precise nature of Flynn's contacts with the Brainwave firm could not be determined on Friday. Bloomberg reported that Flynn was supposed to help drum up new business for the firm with U.S. agencies, and that he has met with company officials at least 10 times. The meetings reportedly were held as late as September, when Flynn helped pitch Brainwave's services to officials from the Bangladeshi defense forces. Independent scientists have disputed the accuracy and reliability of brain fingerprinting, and Brainwave has not released research supporting its claims that the tool is highly effective. But Bloomberg quoted Brainwave President Krishna Ika as saying that Flynn had tested the device himself, donning a helmet-like headpiece fitted with sensors. "He found it very convincing," Ika told the news service. Julie Tate and Laura Helmuth contributed to this report.

In an escalation of Democratic efforts to highlight questions about President Donald Trump's potential conflicts of interest and alleged ties to Russia, a senior House Democrat is dusting off a little-used legislative tool to force a committee debate or floor vote on the issue. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., filed a "resolution of inquiry" Thursday, a relatively obscure parliamentary tactic used to force presidents and executive-branch agencies to share records with Congress. Under House practice, such a resolution must be debated and acted upon in committee or else it can be discharged to the House floor for consideration. Nadler's resolution asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions to provide "copies of any document, record, memo, correspondence, or other communication of the Department of Justice" that pertains to any "criminal or counterintelligence investigation" into Trump, his White House team or certain campaign associates; any investment made by a foreign power or agent thereof in Trump's businesses; Trump's plans to distance himself from his business empire; and any Trump-related examination of federal conflict of interest laws or the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Nadler, the No. 2 ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said that his move came after Democrats sent two letters to Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and another letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., asking for investigations into Trump's financial entanglements. U.S. counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said.

U.S. counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said. But while it has been clear for months that a broad investigation... "All of this demands investigation, and of course they've refused," Nadler said Thursday at the House Democrats' annual policy retreat here. "This resolution will force them to confront the issue." Besides Trump, the resolution asks for records from any investigation targeting national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, oil industry consultant and former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, political operative Roger Stone, or "any employee of the Executive Office of the President." All four men have come under scrutiny over alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has stepped down from the management of his business empire, but he has not divested his assets as recommended by the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics. He has also denied doing any business in Russia: "I have no deals, I have no loans, and I have no dealings," he said on Jan. 11. Resolutions of inquiry have been introduced by Congress hundreds of times since 1947, according to the Congressional Research Service, usually by members of the party not occupying the White House at the time. Most such resolutions deal with politically sensitive issues, but few have targeted the president as personally as Nadler's does. More Democrats are calling for FBI Director James Comey's resignation after a closed-door briefing on the intelligence community's Russian hacking report Friday, during which members say Comey stonewalled them about whether the FBI is investigating alleged links between President-elect Donald Trump... More Democrats are calling for FBI Director James Comey's resignation after a closed-door briefing on the intelligence community's Russian hacking report Friday, during which members say Comey stonewalled them about whether the FBI is investigating alleged links between President-elect Donald Trump... Under House rules, a resolution of inquiry is referred to a committee, which has 14 legislative days to debate and vote on whether how it should be reported to the floor. If the committee does not take action in that 14-day span, the measure can be called up on the House floor for a debate and vote. The last resolution of inquiry to see floor action was in 1995, when the House voted to order President Bill Clinton to release documents on the Mexican economy and International Monetary Fund activities. Nadler said the maneuver will force Republicans to debate their role in holding Trump' accountable for his potential business conflicts, and possibly force every member of Congress to vote on the matter. Should the resolution come to the floor, Republicans would likely move to table it, Nadler said: "That means every Republican will have to vote, in effect, on whether or not to abdicate their responsibility to have oversight." He added that while his might be the first resolution of inquiry to be filed in the 115th Congress, it will probably not be the last: Democrats on other congressional committees, he said, are likely to file their own resolutions in the months and years to come.

U.S. counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said. But while it has been clear for months that a broad investigation is underway, what remains murky - even to lawmakers receiving closed briefings - is its scope and target. It is unclear if the intercepts being examined have any connection to the Trump campaign. But the investigation adds to the uncertainty surrounding Trump's relationship with Russia even as he is sworn in as U.S. president. U.S. intelligence agencies have already concluded that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump win. FBI Director James Comey has been chastised by Democratic lawmakers for refusing to even acknowledge that it was investigating alleged links between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been under FBI scrutiny for some time, including for allegations of illegal financial dealings in Ukraine, current and former U.S. officials said. Manafort has done business in Russia and Ukraine. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, CIA and the National Security Agency, which intercepts phone calls, emails and other electronic communications of foreigners overseas, are also involved in the probe, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is an ongoing matter. The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said. The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said. McClatchy and the New York Times first reported on details of the investigation. Manafort was forced out of the campaign in August in the wake of slipping poll numbers for Trump and news reports about his financial dealings with pro-Moscow leaders in Ukraine in which he is alleged to have received millions of dollars in secret cash payments. Manafort, a veteran GOP political operative, was hired last spring to work with Trump's campaign of political neophytes to be a voice of experience. But Manafort was not a typical Washington political hand. He was also a global deal-maker with ties to business and political leaders linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Manafort, in a response to the Times, said he had no contact with Russian officials and had not directed any others to have such contact. In congressional testimony, Comey has been cagey on whether there is an active investigation of Trump associates and their possible ties to Russia. His answers left the impression that a probe of some sort was underway, but his refusal to be more direct has frustrated Democrats who were outraged by Comey's comments late in the election on the FBI's probe of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Vice President-elect Mike Pence denied Sunday that the Trump campaign had any contacts with Russia during the campaign.Repeatedly pressed on the issue on "Fox News Sunday," Pence eventually answered directly, saying, "Of course not.""Why would there be any contacts between the campaign" and Russia,...

During a hearing earlier this month, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked Comey whether the FBI has investigated "reported relationships" between "individuals associated with the Trump campaign" and "the Russians." Comey replied that he "would never comment on investigations, whether we have one or not in an open forum like this." Comey's position drew a derisive response from Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who said, "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid." The FBI chief then tried to qualify his answer, saying that "we sometimes think differently about closed investigations," referring to the Clinton probe, "but he asked me if I had any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that." The Washington Post's Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump has long been effusive in his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, which will air ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday, Trump doubled down on his "respect" for Putin - even in the face of accusations that Putin and his associates have murdered journalists and dissidents in Russia. "I do respect him. Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'll get along with them," Trump told O'Reilly. O'Reilly pressed on, declaring to the president that "Putin is a killer." Unfazed, Trump didn't back away, but rather compared Putin's reputation for extrajudicial killings with the United States. "There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers," Trump said. "Well, you think our country is so innocent?" President Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration’s foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first official president-to-president contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

President Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration’s foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first official president-to-president contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. As his top aides looked on, Trump sat in the... Trump added that he thinks the United States is "better" getting along with Russia than not. "If Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all around the world, major fight. That's a good thing," Trump said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. It wouldn't be the first time Trump has brushed aside the topic of Putin's political killings. In a 2015 interview on "Morning Joe," Trump was pressed on the same issue and gave a similar answer. "He kills journalists that don't agree with him," the show's host, Joe Scarborough, pointed out. "Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe," Trump said. As recently as this week, a prominent Putin critic exhibited symptoms of poisoning for the second time since 2015. The incident drew the attention of Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), a staunch Russia critic, who tweeted two newspaper editorials that call for the United States to denounce the incident as an act of political retribution. He called both editorials "a must-read."

President Donald Trump offered a fulsome defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend, leaving Republican lawmakers frustrated and flummoxed yet again by the president's warm feelings toward the rival nation. In a Fox News interview, Trump, who during the campaign repeatedly praised Putin, again said he respected the Russian leader and hoped to get along with Moscow, and he seemed to equate the United States with its adversary when pressed by host Bill O'Reilly, who said, "But he's a killer though. Putin's a killer." "There are a lot of killers," Trump said, in an interview that aired Sunday before the Super Bowl. "We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?" Trump's comments came even as his United Nations envoy, Nikki Haley, on Thursday condemned Russia's "aggressive actions" in eastern Ukraine and as both the Senate and House intelligence committees launched investigations into alleged hacking by Russia of the U.S. election that the intelligence community believes was intended to benefit Trump. The issue of Russia dogged Trump's presidential campaign - including after a news conference where he suggested that Russia hack Hillary Clinton's emails - and his latest comments left Capitol Hill Republicans scrambling to distance themselves from the president and his unusually friendly stance toward Putin, who has praised the president as a "smart" man. In an interview with CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Putin "a former KGB agent" and "a thug," and he rejected any comparison between the two nations, citing Russia's annexation of Crimea, its incursions into Ukraine and its interference in the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump has long been effusive in his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike.

President Donald Trump has long been effusive in his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, which will air ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday, Trump doubled down on his "respect" for Putin... "I don't think there's any equivalency between the way that the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does," McConnell said. The senator added that while he hoped not to "critique the president's every utterance," he found significant differences between the two nations. "I do think America is exceptional. America is different," McConnell said. "We don't operate in any way the way the Russians do. I think there's a clear distinction here that all Americans understand, and no, I would not have characterized it that way." House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was similarly wary. "Speaker Ryan has consistently and frequently spoken out on Russia and Putin and made his opinions well known, including the need for continued sanctions," spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Sunday. She pointed to Ryan's comments at a CNN town hall broadcast last month, where he called Russia a "global menace" and said Putin "does not share our interests; he frustrates our interests." The Trump administration on Wednesday maintained a low-key approach to the latest flare-up of violence in eastern Ukraine, where the government accuses Russian-backed forces of stepping up attacks.

The Trump administration on Wednesday maintained a low-key approach to the latest flare-up of violence in eastern Ukraine, where the government accuses Russian-backed forces of stepping up attacks. The restrained tone may reflect the start of a new U.S. approach to dealing with Russia's cross-border... "Let me put it this way, the Russians are up to no good, we all know that," Ryan said, responding to a question about Russia's election meddling. "We've got to make sure going forward that we do everything we can on cyber, on all of the other things to make sure that they can't do this again." Congressional Republicans have broken with Trump over dozens of controversial statements he has made during his campaign, his transition and now his presidency. But few issues appear to have confounded lawmakers as much as his consistent defense of Putin. Trump's coziness is at odds with years of Republican foreign policy orthodoxy calling for a more aggressive stance toward Putin's regime. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., weighed in on Twitter with two missives that he personally penned. "When has a Democratic political activists ever been poisoned by the GOP or vice versa? We are not the same as #Putin," he wrote. In a second tweet, he said the United States should lift sanctions on Russia only if it ends its violations in Ukraine. And Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wy., the daughter of former Vice President Richard Cheney, also took to Twitter to say that Trump's "statement suggesting moral equivalence between Putin's Russia and the United States of America is deeply troubling and wrong." Appearing on four Sunday shows, Vice President Mike Pence rejected the notion that Trump had equated Russia to the United States. "I simply don't accept that there was any moral equivalency in the president's comments," Pence said on CBS' "Face the Nation." "There was no moral equivalency. What you heard there was a determination to attempt to deal with the world as it is - to start afresh with Putin and to start afresh with Russia." Pressed by John Dickerson, the show's host, on whether he believed the United States was morally superior to Russia, Pence repeatedly dodged the question, instead finally saying, "American ideals are superior to countries all across the world." Pence, who would not commit to maintaining sanctions against Russia if it continues to violate a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, nonetheless took a slightly harder line than the president on Russia. Asked on ABC's "This Week" whether the White House planned to put Russia on notice, as it had Iran, over violating the cease-fire, Pence said, "We're watching, and very troubled by the increased hostilities over the past week in eastern Ukraine." But he also broadly defended his boss, saying, "There's a new style of leadership, not just a new leader in the White House." "President Trump is bringing a very candid - and direct type of leadership to the White House," Pence said. "And in conversations with leaders around the world, frankly, I think they all find it very refreshing." Not everyone seemed to agree. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who ran against Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, issued a sharp rebuke on Twitter. "America has been a beacon of light and freedom," he wrote. "There is no equivalence with the brutal regime of Vladimir Putin." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., even called for an investigation by the FBI into Trump's financial, personal and political connections to Russia. "I want to know what the Russians have on Donald Trump," she said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We want to see his tax returns so we can have truth in the relationship between Putin, whom he admires, and Donald Trump."

White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller appeared on ABC's "The Week" on Feb. 12, spouting a bunch of false talking points on alleged voter fraud. (He also repeated similar claims on other Sunday interview shows.) To his credit, host George Stephanopoulus repeatedly challenged Miller, noting he had provided no evidence. But Miller charged ahead, using the word "fact" three times in a vain effort to bolster his position. Here's a guide through the back and forth. "STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me move on, though, to the question of voter fraud as well. President Trump again this week suggested in a meeting with senators that thousands of illegal voters were bused from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and that's what caused his defeat in the state of New Hampshire, also the defeat of Senator Kelly Ayotte. "That has provoked a response from a member of the Federal Election Commission, Ellen Weintraub, who says, 'I call upon the president to immediately share New Hampshire voter fraud evidence so that his allegations may be investigated promptly.' "Do you have that evidence?" Stephanopoulus is referring to a Feb. 10 Politico report of a closed-door meeting Trump held with senators to discuss the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: "The president claimed that he and Ayotte both would have been victorious in the Granite State if not for the 'thousands' of people who were 'brought in on buses' from neighboring Massachusetts to 'illegally' vote in New Hampshire. According to one participant who described the meeting, 'an uncomfortable silence' momentarily overtook the room." Ayotte lost her Senate race by 743 votes but did not challenge the results; Hillary Clinton defeated Trump in New Hampshire by nearly 3,000 votes. The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called "judicial usurpation of power." White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller... The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called "judicial usurpation of power." White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller... "MILLER: I have actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who's worked in New Hampshire politics. It's very real. It's very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence." This is false. PolitiFact New Hampshire in November gave New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu a "Pants on Fire" for claiming voters were bused in - and Sununu quickly retreated from his comment. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said that voter fraud was not widespread problem, largely because the law requires voters to show a valid identification at the polls. If an ID is lacking, the voter's photo is taken, they have to sign an affidavit affirming their identify and then state officials follow up. Sununu later said he did not mean to imply that "I see buses coming over," saying it was more of a figure of speech. "Sununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections," PolitiFact reported. "Those staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark's address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled." "MILLER: But I can tell you this, voter fraud is a serious problem in this country. You have millions of people who are registered in two states or who are dead who are registered to vote. And you have 14 percent of non-citizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote, which is an astonishing statistic." Ugh. Miller has once again resorted to bogus claims that we have repeatedly debunked. To repeat: A 2012 Pew Center on the States study found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state (which could happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without telling the former state) and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls. But the primary author of the Pew report tweeted in response to Trump's staff's claim that he "can confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud." As to the 14 percent figure - stemming from research by Old Dominion University professors, using data from 2008 and 2010 - that has also been misrepresented by Trump and his staff. They have ignored updates and challenges to the research. The researchers have also warned that "it is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens." One of the researchers, Jesse Richman, wrote about the Trump staff's use of his research. The results "suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions," he said, noting "there has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud, which we don't think they are." In other words, the researcher who Miller is citing says his research does not show what Miller claims. "STEPHANOPOULOS: You can't make a -- hold on a second. You just claimed again that there was illegal voting in New Hampshire, people bused in from the state of Massachusetts. Do you have any evidence to back that up? "MILLER: I'm saying anybody - George, go to New Hampshire. Talk to anybody who has worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody is aware of the problem in New Hampshire with respect to - "STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm asking you as the White House senior - hold on a second. I'm asking you as the White House senior policy adviser. The president made a statement, saying he was the victim of voter fraud, people are being bused from - "MILLER: And the president - the president - the president was. "STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have any evidence? "MILLER: If this is an issue that interests you, then we can talk about it more in the future. And we now have our government is beginning to get stood up. But we have a Department of Justice and we have more officials. "An issue of voter fraud is something we're going to be looking at very seriously and very hard. "But the reality is, is that we know for a fact, you have massive numbers of non-citizens registered to vote in this country. Nobody disputes that. " False. As shown above, this is disputed even by the researcher whose work is being cited by Miller: "There has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud, which we don't think they are." "MILLER: And many, many highly qualified people, like Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, have looked deeply into this issue and have confirmed it to be true and have put together evidence. "And I suggest you invite Kris Kobach onto your show and he can walk you through some of the evidence of voter fraud in greater detail." Miller mentioned Kobach, but in Kansas, his efforts at proving voter fraud have been mocked. In a scathing editorial titled "Kris Kobach is a big fraud on Kansas voter fraud," the Kansas City Star accused the "publicity-seeking" Kansas secretary of state of throwing out "wild claims" and wasting taxpayer funds as part of "loathsome attacks on U.S. immigration policy." State Rep. John Carmichael, a Democrat, has introduced a bill to strip Kobach of his prosecutorial power because he has "dramatically overstated the frequency of voter fraud during his tenure as Kansas' secretary of state," the Wichita Eagle reported in January. "Carmichael noted that Kobach has not brought a single case against a noncitizen for voting illegally. All of the cases he has brought concern U.S. citizens accused of voting in more than one state." "STEPHANOPOULOS: Just for the record, you have provided absolutely no evidence. The president's made a statement. "MILLER: The White House has provided enormous evidence with respect to voter fraud, with respect to people being registered in more than one state, dead people voting, non-citizens being registered to vote. George, it is a fact and you will not deny it, that there are massive numbers of non-citizens in this country, who are registered to vote. That is a scandal." As noted, the "enormous evidence" has been repeatedly debunked. Saying it over and over does not make it so. "MILLER: We should stop the presses. And as a country, we should be aghast about the fact that you have people who have no right to vote in this country, registered to vote, canceling out the franchise of lawful citizens of this country. "That's the story we should be talking about. And I'm prepared to go on any show, anywhere, anytime, and repeat it and say the president of the United States is correct 100 percent. "STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you just repeated, though, you just made those declarations. But, for the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence that the president's claim that he would have won the general - the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn't voted, zero evidence for either one of those claims." Stephanopoulos is right. The White House continues to provide zero evidence to back up its claims of voter fraud. Officials instead retreat to the same bogus talking points that have been repeatedly shown to be false. It's pretty shameless to cite research in a way that even the researcher says is inappropriate, and yet Miller keeps saying 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote. The Republican governor of New Hampshire has admitted he was wrong to say buses of illegal voters voted in the election, and yet Miller shamelessly suggests that is the case. Miller cites a supposed expert on voter fraud, Kris Kobach, who has been mocked for failing to prove his own claims of voter fraud. Miller also repeats a claim about people being registered to vote in two states, even though that is not an example of voter fraud. Miller earns Four Pinocchios -- over and over again.

As a young conservative in liberal Santa Monica, Calif., Stephen Miller clashed frequently with his high school, often calling in to a national radio show to lambaste administrators for promoting multiculturalism, allowing Spanish-language morning announcements and failing to require recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Miller's outrage did not appear to subside after he graduated. As a Duke University sophomore, Miller penned a column, titled "Santa Monica High's Multicultural Fistfights," in which he ripped his alma mater as a "center for political indoctrination." "The social experiment that Santa Monica High School has become is yet one more example of the dismal failure of leftism and the delusions and paranoia of its architects," Miller wrote in the 2005 article for the conservative magazine FrontPage. In the years before he became a top adviser to President Donald Trump and a leading West Wing advocate for the executive order temporarily halting entry into the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries, Miller was developing his skills as a culture warrior and conservative provocateur eager to condemn liberal orthodoxy - particularly on matters of race and identity. Like Trump, Miller forged that identity while immersed in liberal communities, giving him cachet with fellow conservatives for waging his battles on opposition turf. Starting as a teenager, with his frequent calls to the nationally syndicated "Larry Elder Show," Miller made a name for himself in conservative media circles for his willingness to take controversial stands and act as a champion for those on the right who felt maligned by a culture of political correctness. He produced a canon of searing columns on race, gender and other hot-button issues and, at Duke, became known to Fox News viewers as a leading defender of the white lacrosse players wrongfully accused of raping a black stripper. By his late 20s, Miller was a key aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., helping to torpedo a long-sought goal of immigrant advocacy groups to put millions of unauthorized Hispanic immigrants on a path to citizenship. Today, at 31, he has emerged alongside former Breitbart News chief Stephen Bannon as a chief engineer of Trump's populist "America first" agenda that has roiled the Washington debate over immigration and trade and sparked alarm among traditional U.S. allies abroad. Miller, whose White House title is senior adviser to the president for policy, has been at Trump's side for more than a year, joining his campaign in January 2016 when Sessions, who was sworn in Thursday as attorney general, was one of the only Republican officials to endorse the businessman's candidacy. While Trump at times revamped his campaign leadership, with Bannon joining relatively late in August 2016, Miller remained a steady presence whose profile and influence grew over time. He wrote some of Trump's most strident speeches during the campaign, including his Republican National Convention acceptance address in which Trump declared that "nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it." Editor's Note: Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. After publication, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Post that Stephen Bannon did not travel to see Homeland... Editor's Note: Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. After publication, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Post that Stephen Bannon did not travel to see Homeland... And Miller sometimes served as the warm-up act for Trump at his large campaign rallies, including a rip-roaring speech in Wisconsin during the Republican primary when Miller thrashed Trump's chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for supporting increases in legal immigration that would result in more Muslims entering the country - a position Miller charged that Cruz held with "no regard, no concern" for how it would "affect the security of you and your family." After reports of Miller's central role crafting the order imposing a 90-day ban on citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States, the young aide has drawn uncomfortable new scrutiny. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, host of the "Morning Joe" program that is a Trump favorite, recently blasted Miller as a "very young person in the White House on a power trip thinking that you can just write executive orders and tell all of your Cabinet agencies to go to hell." For Miller, though, working in the Trump White House is a natural culmination of his young career - a chance to work for a president who appears to share his zeal for getting under the skin of political opponents. "The way that people on the left abuse and slam people on the right - that's probably the thing that's most concerned Stephen," said Elder, the Los Angeles-based conservative talk-show host who Miller describes as a mentor. "The lack of fairness. The left-wing dominance in academia. The left-wing dominance in the media. The left-wing dominance in Hollywood." Even as confusion, internal dissent and widespread condemnation greeted President Trump’s travel ban and crackdown on refugees this weekend, senior White House aides say they are are only getting started. Trump and his aides justified Friday’s executive order, which blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim... Even as confusion, internal dissent and widespread condemnation greeted President Trump’s travel ban and crackdown on refugees this weekend, senior White House aides say they are are only getting started. Trump and his aides justified Friday’s executive order, which blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim... Miller's ideological awakening found its roots in a left-leaning high school where he has written that social life and academics were badly segregated, despite what he saw as a devotion among teachers and administrators to multiculturalism. "My best judgment at the time was that the educational answer that had been provided, which was to reject the melting-pot formula in favor of an educational formula that focused on all the things that made us different, was not working," he told The Washington Post in an interview. Miller said he rejects the "provocateur" label, saying it suggests that his intentions are to seek attention rather than what he says is his true goal: "to battle against slim odds, a stacked deck and powerful entrenched forces, in pursuit of justice." Miller said he turned away from the more liberal politics of his parents as he grew up in Santa Monica after buying a subscription to Guns & Ammo magazine and becoming familiar with the writings of actor Charlton Heston, a longtime president of the National Rifle Association. Miller began appearing on Elder's show, a local broadcast that is aired in 300 markets, after the 9/11 attacks, when he felt his home town lacked sufficient patriotism. Elder said that Miller called in the first time to voice objections to his school's failure to recite the Pledge of Allegiance daily as required by state law. The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican... The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican... In writings at the time and later, Miller said he lobbied for the pledge recitation against a recalcitrant administration that refused to put the practice in place even after he had flagged the legal violation. "Osama Bin Laden would feel very welcome at Santa Monica High School," he wrote in a letter to the editor at the time. "It's difficult to overstate the extent to which the instructional environment on campus was breathtakingly PC," Miller said in an interview. Mark Kelly, who was the principal at the time, said he did not recall the episode as a major fight. When Miller flagged the issue, Kelly said he researched the law and realized that the school, indeed, needed to change its policy and institute the recitation of the pledge. Miller was invited to lead the pledge after it was reinstated. "Stephen was right," Kelly recalled. The victory was a validation for Miller of the necessity to fight powerful figures who opposed his views. Miller pushed the school administration over his desire to host an on-campus speech by David Horowitz - a onetime Marxist, then controversial far-right conservative - who became an early mentor and would later introduce Miller to Sessions. Horowitz recalls being immediately impressed with Miller. "One of the things that struck me when I became a conservative was that conservatives don't have any fight," Horowitz said. "They don't have any stomach for it. . . . Stephen Miller had that from the get-go." As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who deliberate on... As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who deliberate on... Cultural-identity issues appeared to particularly animate Miller. In a column in his high school newspaper titled "A Time to Kill," he urged violent response to radical Islamists. "We have all heard about how peaceful and benign the Islamic religion is, but no matter how many times you say that, it cannot change the fact that millions of radical Muslims would celebrate your death for the simple reason that you are Christian, Jewish or American," Miller wrote. Ari Rosmarin, a civil rights lawyer who edited the student newspaper at time, recalled that Miller was especially critical of a Mexican American student group. "I think he's got a very sharp understanding of what words and issues will poke and provoke progressives, because he came up around it and really cut his teeth picking these fights that had low stakes but high offense," Rosmarin said. That skill led Miller to become a mini-celebrity in conservative intellectual circles because of his passion, age and home town. He appeared 70 times on Elder's show before his high school graduation, according to the host. "He found a really unique role to play that was deeply attractive to national conservatives," Rosmarin said. "He was like a lonely warrior behind enemy lines." In the halls of Santa Monica High School, though, where students and teachers took pride in their ethnic diversity and liberal values, Miller was becoming something of a pariah. That environment prompted Miller to become even more assertive, recalled one of his former teachers. "He had to come on a little strong as a defense mechanism - just to survive," said the teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for how colleagues would react to the defense of an alumnus so closely associated with Trump. "He came under a lot of fire, even from teachers." At Duke, Miller wrote a biweekly column for the student newspaper that regularly aroused the ire of classmates. "Men and women are in many ways the same, but they're also innately and magnificently different," he wrote in one column that argued laws requiring men and women to be paid equally would hurt businesses and that the pay gap largely resulted from women taking time off for childbirth, being less willing to ask for raises and being less likely to take part in hazardous work. "The point is that the pay gap has virtually nothing to do with gender discrimination," he wrote. "Sorry, feminists. Hate to break this good news to you." In a column titled "The Case for Christmas," Miller, who is Jewish, argued that the holiday should be more widely recognized as a "crucial American holiday." "Christianity is embedded in the very soul of our nation," he wrote. Miller stepped into the national spotlight after three white lacrosse players were falsely accused of rape in a case rife with racial tension. The players were eventually cleared, and the local district attorney was disbarred for prosecutorial misconduct in the case. Miller wrote a series of columns about the case and appeared on national television to discuss it. "This travesty has been allowed to continue because we live in a nation paralyzed by racial paranoia," he wrote in November 2006, writing that professors and others were frightened to speak in defense of the students because the district attorney had turned the case into a racial crusade, and opposition "would be perceived negatively by the black community and that there would be a political price to pay." Speaking years later about his role as an advocate for the players, Miller told The Post: "The one takeaway I have from it is that in a difficult moment, I took a stand on principle - and I was correct." Reflecting more broadly on his college-era columns, Miller said his writings were a good reflection of his views at the time. But, he said, "I would surely hope that any person who was a writer about political and controversial topics in college would find that their thoughts had matured on a variety of issues." He declined to outline where his own views had changed over time. Miller's outspokenness in the lacrosse case first brought him to the attention of Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who was a Duke graduate student at the time. Spencer said he became friendly with Miller through the Duke Conservative Union in fall 2006. "He was very out in front, very bold and strong," Spencer said in an interview. Spencer last year told the Daily Beast that he was a "mentor" to Miller, which Miller has angrily denied. "I condemn him. I condemn his views. I have no relationship with him. He was not my friend," Miller said. Miller noted that he served on campus as the executive director of the leading conservative group, which put him in contact with Spencer. "Our interaction was limited to the activities of the organization, of which he was a member and, thus, ceased upon graduation," Miller said. But Spencer said that the two met frequently during their Duke days. As first reported by Mother Jones magazine, they both helped organize an immigration debate between Peter Brimelow, an anti-immigration activist whose website has been labeled a hate site by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Peter Laufer, who advocated for opening the southern U.S. border. Spencer praised Miller's media savvy and organizational skills in advance of that event. David Bitner, a friend of Miller's who also belonged to the conservative club at Duke, said the two did interact in the small group. But Bitner called it "scurrilous libel" for Spencer to claim he was Miller's mentor. "Richard Spencer believes in white identity politics. Stephen Miller disavows identity politics," he said. Nevertheless, Miller's role in the White House has been greeted with enthusiasm by Spencer and other white nationalist figures. "He is not a white nationalist," Spencer said. "But you can't be this passionate about the immigration issue and not have a sense of the American nation as it historically emerged." After attending Trump's inauguration, Jared Taylor, another high-profile white nationalist, posted a piece to his website in which he wrote that Trump is "not a racially conscious white man" but that there "are men close to him - Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions, Stephen Miller - who may have a clearer understanding of race, and their influence could grow." In an interview, Taylor said he was "speculating" and that he has not met or spoken with Miller. Miller said he has "profound objections" to the views advanced by Taylor and Spencer, saying: "I condemn this rancid ideology." Elder, who is black, said he has never heard Miller speak of Spencer or Taylor or express what he considers racist views. Instead, Elder said, Miller believes as he does: "Race and racism are no longer major problems in America. This is the fairest majority-white country in the world. If you work hard and make good decisions, you'll be fine." Miller said that his views at the time were best summed up in a 2005 column in the Santa Monica Mirror, titled "My Dream for the End of Racism," in which he argued that Americans should focus on how far the country has come in overcoming such prejudice. "No one claims that racism is extinct - but it is endangered," he wrote. "And if we are to entirely extract this venom of prejudice from the United States, I proclaim Americanism to be the key." Focusing on "multiculturalism," he wrote, has had the effect of keeping different groups separate. Miller's White House role is in many ways a departure for an activist who has mostly seen himself as representing an oppressed political minority. Now he holds the power, helping to drive the government while working steps from the Oval Office. Bitner said he wonders how Miller's tactics will translate. "I don't think he's had the opportunity to practice this," he said. "These are all outsiders, many of them people who have been vocal minorities. How do you transition from there to governing?" Alice Crites contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump says "someone should look into who paid" for the rallies around the country Saturday that urged him to release his tax returns. Trump tweeted Sunday: "I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?" Trump was the first major-party nominee in more than 40 years not to release his returns and he reneged on a campaign commitment to release them. He said they were being audited. "Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over," he tweeted. Thousands of sign-waving, chanting protesters marched Saturday through streets across America, demanding that the president release his tax returns so the public can examine his business ties and determine whether he has links to foreign powers. The demonstrations came on the date taxpayers traditionally have to file their returns by and just days before this year's filing deadline Tuesday. The tax day protests in more than a dozen cities were largely peaceful, though occasionally demonstrators and some pro-Trump groups taunted each other in face-to-face exchanges. In Berkeley, California, police arrested at least 20 people at unrelated gatherings of about 200 pro- and anti-Trump people in a park after fist fighting erupted. Officers confiscated knives and makeshift weapons. Trump has said that voters don't care about his tax returns. But many demonstrators said they hoped Saturday's marches would convince Trump otherwise. "We do care. We want to see his taxes," said Ann Demerlis, who was among hundreds who marched in Philadelphia from City Hall to an area in front of historic Independence Hall, carrying signs and chanting "We want your taxes now!" Seventy-one-year-old Ilene Singh said he's wrong. She rode a bus from New Jersey to New York City with her friend Geraldine Markowitz, 83, to take part in the protests. "We're here to say we care," said Singh. Pushing her walker, Karin Arlin, 85, a Holocaust survivor who came to the U.S. from Germany when she was 9, said she's also worried about the direction of the country. "You don't know which way the country goes," said Arlin next to her 89-year-old husband who fled Czechoslovakia during World War II. "I hope Republicans see it." Protesters in Raleigh, North Carolina, said they suspect that Trump's returns might show he has paid little or nothing to the government he now heads, or that he was indebted to Russian, Chinese or other foreign interests. "His reputation ... as a businessman and, more importantly, as a true American, a person who is concerned with American values, would be totally destroyed if all his financial information was made public," said Mike Mannshardt, a retired teacher. One of Trump's sharpest critics in the House spoke to protesters at the U.S. Capitol just before they set off on a march to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, of California, said there's nothing to prevent Trump from releasing his income taxes. "If he thinks he can get away with playing king, he's got another thought coming," Waters said. Trump's break with precedent has raised questions about possible conflicts of interest. Democrats are pushing for a vote on a bill from Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California, which would require the president and all major-party nominees to publicly disclose their previous three years of tax returns with the Office of Government Ethics or the Federal Election Commission. Republicans also have rebuffed Democrats' efforts to get the House Ways and Means Committee to act. It has legal authority to obtain confidential tax records, and could vote to make them public.

Making the case for a Republican repeal and replacement of his predecessor's health care law, President Donald Trump reached for a dire-sounding argument that's unsupported by the data. "Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare," Trump told his audience at a Monday night rally in Louisville, Ky. In fact, the number of doctors in the U.S. actively caring for patients grew from 799,501 in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, to 860,939 in 2015, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The American College of Physicians, which represents internists, the largest specialty, says its enrollment of new doctors has increased every year since 2012. The American Academy of Family Physicians has seen its membership grow from 94,620 to 124,900 since 2008. While there are anecdotes about doctors dropping out, "we see no significant number exiting related to the Affordable Care Act," said Dr. Atul Grover, executive vice president of the medical colleges association. "There is also no evidence of a declining interest in medicine since the ACA took effect." Change in the medical profession has brought discontent among doctors, but the culprits are much larger than President Barack Obama's health care law. A shift in the way doctors are paid — increasingly for results, rather than for specific procedures — and paperwork requirements driven by insurance companies and Medicare are leading factors, according to a 2016 survey of doctors by the Physicians Foundation. Another big factor driving departures from the profession is age. Physicians in the baby-boom generation, particularly those who are specialists, are particularly inclined to speed up their retirement plans, the survey found. House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage.

House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage. The tweaks addressed numerous GOP concerns about the legislation, ranging from... The largest professional organizations that represent doctors are opposed to Trump's efforts to repeal and replace the Obama law. The internists' group says the proposal "will likely result in less access to coverage and higher costs for millions of patients." And the family physicians' group says the proposal threatens the "significant increase in coverage" that the current law has provided.

"Under President Trump's leadership, we're actually also going to finally allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines - the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance." - Vice President Mike Pence, speech in Louisville, March 12, 2017 "Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines? It's something that you can do [with] your car insurance." - White House press secretary Sean Spicer, news briefing, March 14 "We're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines - the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance." - Pence, speech in Jacksonville, Florida, March 18 "President Trump's vision is very simple . . . allowing the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance." - Pence, speech to the Club for Growth, West Palm Beach, Fla., March 19 - - - One of President Donald Trump's signature promises is to allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines. This was supposed to be tackled in "phase three" of the administration's plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, now in doubt because of the administration's failure to advance the "phase one" bill in the House. Vice President Mike Pence was in full charm mode Saturday when he touched down here for a visit to try to sell the Republican health-care plan in a state that has a complex relationship with former president Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Vice President Mike Pence was in full charm mode Saturday when he touched down here for a visit to try to sell the Republican health-care plan in a state that has a complex relationship with former president Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Just a day earlier, Kentucky's Republican Gov. Matt... Many experts are skeptical about whether buying health insurance across state lines would work - more on that below - but we were interested in claims made by administration officials such as Vice President Pence and White House press secretary Sean Spicer that this would be similar to buying life insurance and car insurance. The way they talk about it, we have to wonder whether administration officials even understand how insurance is bought and sold in the United States. The Facts In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempted insurance companies from aspects of federal antitrust law and ensured that individual states remained the primary regulators of insurance. That had been the case since 1868, but a Supreme Court ruling had placed the state role in doubt until Congress reaffirmed it. So insurance companies must be licensed in each state. In other words, this standard exists with all insurance products. Generally, there are two types of insurance companies: life and health insurance companies; and property and casualty insurance companies. The latter sell products such as homeowners' insurance and automobile insurance. Statehouse Democrats want Indiana's congressional delegation to defend former Gov. Mike Pence's expansion of the state's Medicaid program from proposed GOP cuts backed by President Donald Trump. A proposal in Congress to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature health care law would lead... Statehouse Democrats want Indiana's congressional delegation to defend former Gov. Mike Pence's expansion of the state's Medicaid program from proposed GOP cuts backed by President Donald Trump. A proposal in Congress to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature health care law would lead... There are obviously big differences among the products. Car insurance is strictly limited to a period of time, and rates depend on the value of the vehicle, the use of the vehicle, the driver's record and so forth. Health insurance, by contrast, is heavily regulated at the federal level (especially after the Affordable Care Act mandated that all plans cover a group of essential benefits). And health insurance companies are required to set up provider networks and negotiate prices. But the bottom line is that all insurance products are sold state by state, overseen by state insurance commissioners. You may be able to get Geico car insurance in both Virginia and California, but the products may be different, depending on state regulations. Similarly, you may buy Aetna health insurance policies in each state, but again they are subject to state regulations and obviously have different provider networks. Essentially, if Trump were to push through a plan to sell health insurance across state lines, he would need to repeal all or part of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. But as we mentioned, that act applies to all insurance products. "Insurance is regulated at the state level in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which has been in place for 64 years," said Lynne McChristian, executive director of Florida State University's Center for Risk Management Education and Research. "It is not accurate to say that car insurance and life insurance are regulated across state lines. In fact, it is false." She said that many people may not realize that when they call an insurer that has an out-of-state location, they are talking to someone who is licensed to contract business in the prospective customer's state of residence. If you move to a different state, you might stick with the same company, but your policy is updated to reflect the laws of the new state - and your premiums are likely to change. Five states have passed laws that have either allowed interstate health-insurance sales or encouraged the concept of forming a compact, allowing for products to be sold in a group of states. But no insurance company has shown much interest, in part because entering a new health insurance market is time-consuming and difficult. An official at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the concept was especially unworkable for health insurance because different states may mandate different coverage, leading to fewer people getting insured, reducing insurance options for consumers and preventing regulators from protecting consumers in their states. For example, one state might require coverage of autism, while another might not. If insurance could be bought across state lines, people seeking autism coverage would flock to the product with coverage. That in turn would make the risk pool unbalanced and force premiums up. Moreover, when people have complaints about insurance coverage today, they can seek redress from a state insurance commissioner. That would be more difficult if someone bought a product from another state. The ACA, in section 1333, encouraged the formation of such regional compacts after January 2016, although as far as we can tell, no regulatory guidance was issued by the Obama administration. Chris Jennings, a health-care consultant who worked for presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, says the provision - which allows two or more states to form a regional health-insurance compact - was inserted by a Republican lawmaker during Senate markups of the ACA. But he thinks the Obama administration did not promote the option "because it was a low priority and there was no evidence it would make a positive difference addressing the myriad of issues they thought they were dealing with." Now that the ACA remains intact, however, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price could issue guidance on the provision and the administration could claim to have begun to fulfill a campaign promise without even passing a law in Congress. We sought an explanation from Pence's office and from the White House communications staff but did not get a response. The Pinocchio Test Car and life insurance currently is sold exactly the same way as health insurance - regulated by state insurance regulators, with policies tailored to the rules and laws set by the state. So it is false to suggest there is any difference. Rating: Pence and Spicer earn Four Pinocchios.

"Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border."- President Trump, weekly address, April 7, 2017 "My administration is - just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time - has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job."- Trump, remarks at North America's Building Trades Unions conference, April 4, 2017 "You see what's happened: 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in. Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. Way down. General Kelly has done a great job."- Trump, remarks at CEO Town Hall on Unleashing American Business, April 4, 2017 "I go to these arenas that have signs all over the place - 'He's kept his promise, he's kept his promise' - because I've done a lot of work. The border is in the best shape it's been in, in decades. Down 61 percent since the inauguration."- Trump, remarks at National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, March 21, 2017 --- President Donald Trump is repeatedly touting reductions in apprehensions at the Southwestern border, attributing the decline to his administration and the leadership of Department of Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Trump also claimed that "drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth" is "way, way down." We don't know if that is accurate. We repeatedly requested 2017 data of drug seizures at the border from Customs and Border Patrol since Trump made the claim, but still have not received a response. The White House didn't provide data, either. We will return to that claim when CBP provides us the data. So for now, we dug into Trump's use of the 64 percent and 61 percent figures. The figure is correct, but it requires some caveats. Here's what we found. First, some context. Southwest border apprehensions have steadily declined since their peak at more than 1.6 million people in fiscal 2000. There have been temporary spikes since 2000 - most recently, there was an uptick in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and their families in 2016, after a significant drop in 2015. Those apprehensions in 2016 were back to 2014 levels, during the height of the flow of Central American migrants illegally crossing the border. These families and children are fleeing rampant violence and crime in a region called the Northern Triangle, comprising Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Many of the Central American migrants turn themselves in to Border Patrol once they reach the southwest border, seeking asylum status. This represents a shift in border migration. The number of Mexicans caught trying to cross the border illegally is dropping (more than 400,000 in fiscal 2010 to about 177,000 in 2016), The Washington Post reported. The number of migrants from the Northern Triangle nearly quadrupled in the same period to almost 179,000. March 2017 total apprehensions were, indeed, very low. It's the lowest monthly number CBP has reported since at least 2000. The 64 percent figure he uses is the total number of people apprehended or "deemed inadmissible" at the southwest border in March 2017 (16,600), compared to the total number in March 2016 (46,150). The 61 percent figure Trump is referring to is the drop in just the Southwest border apprehensions from January 2017 (31,577) to March 2017 (12,193). A 61 percent drop over three months is dramatic, as Trump indicates. But the January data is a total for the month, not since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 - so the majority of the month's data predated his presidency. Actually, the best apples-to-apples measure would be to compare the number of people apprehended or deemed inadmissible for February and March of 2016 with February and March of 2017. That calculation shows there was a 52.4 percent (40,170) decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 (84,466). This would be a more accurate look at the impact of Trump's policy changes to date, rather than focusing on just the month of March. Still, experts caution against putting too much emphasis on the annual, quarterly or monthly numbers, because immigration trends are about flows, not raw numbers. But what is notable about recent apprehensions is that it doesn't fit the seasonal trends. Usually, there's a seasonal lull through winter months, before apprehensions start climbing back up. Apprehensions tend to peak from March to May, before coming back down in the late summer and through the fall. But in fall 2016, there was an increase in apprehensions, despite the seasonal norm. You can see this increase in the bright blue line of 2016 apprehensions in the graphic below. Apprehensions start to increase in July 2016, and through October (see the red line for fiscal 2017), and peak in November 2016. Then apprehensions start falling from November to March. Looking at the red line in the graphic, it's clear that the downward trend in 2017 so far is different and more drastic than any other year since 2002. What does this all mean? Why was there an increase in apprehensions leading up to November 2016, the month of the U.S. presidential election? Why did it start to decline after the election, and so drastically into March? Experts say Trump's rhetoric on immigration made a difference. On-the-ground reactions to federal level immigration policies, such as Trump's executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration, take some time to materialize. But the apparent rush to enter the country before the election indicates people sensed immigration attitudes and policies could drastically change if Trump were elected, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. "There's been a clear and marked decrease in unauthorized border crossings. That's really undeniable," Wilson said. "How much of that is due to policy changes versus rhetoric? It's not really easy to answer that question. My sense is that what we've really seen so far, the big change, has been around rhetoric, communicating. It's been about messaging, and that's worked, essentially. Potential migrants are convinced that this is a difficult time to come to the United States, and they have not been coming." Still, violence continues to escalate in the Northern Triangle in Central America. In the past two years, Mexico and the United States have both turned away comparable flows of northbound Central American refugees and asylum seekers. That means it's unclear how long this downward trend will last. Our friends at PolitiFact found that smugglers may be waiting to find a new route into the United States. In 2015, then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson declared apprehensions were at record lows because of measures his agency had taken to respond to the 2014 influx of Central Americans. (We gave him Two Pinocchios at the time.) As we've seen, the Central American crisis continued to persist, leading to a spike in apprehensions the following year. So the reductions in 2015 under Johnson didn't last long. Trump is citing a documented figure that the total number of apprehensions and people "deemed inadmissible" at the Southwest border declined by 64 percent in March 2017 compared to March 2016, and that there was a 61 percent reduction in Southwest border apprehensions from January 2017 to March 2017. The number of people apprehended or deemed admissible tend to start climbing in March, yet the number continued to decline in March 2017. That shows how uncharacteristically low the flow over the border has been in March 2017. The 61 percent figure also is unique because such a reduction over three months is quite dramatic and bucks seasonal trends. Total apprehensions in March 2017 were the lowest monthly total since at least 2000. But his use of the data still lacks some context. Trump says the 61 percent reduction began since Inauguration Day, or Jan. 20. But the January data is a total for the month, so the majority of the data predates his presidency. As we noted, the most accurate figure would compare February and March of 2016 with those months for 2017. That shows a decrease of 52.4 percent, which is still substantial. Trump's rhetoric during the presidential campaign against illegal immigration and border crossings likely resonated with northbound migrants, experts say. Yet it's unclear what role Trump's immigration actions as president had, or what role Kelly (who was confirmed on Inauguration Day) had in bringing those figures down. And it's too early for Trump to declare he kept his promise; we don't know whether this is the new normal, or a temporary change.

With President Donald Trump in his fourth full week in office, the upheaval inside the administration that West Wing officials had optimistically dismissed as growing pains is now cementing itself as standard operating procedure. Trump - distracted by political brushfires often of his own making - has failed to fill such key posts as White House communications director, while sub-Cabinet positions across agencies and scores of ambassadorships around the globe still sit empty. Upset about damaging leaks of his calls with world leaders and other national security information, Trump has ordered an internal investigation to find the leakers. Staffers, meanwhile, are so fearful about being accused of talking to the media that some have resorted to a secret chat app - Confide - that erases messages as soon as they're read. The chaos and competing factions that were a Trump trademark in business and campaigning now are starting to define his presidency, according to interviews with a dozen White House officials as well as other Republicans. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal White House dynamics and deliberations. Some senior officials are worried about their own standing with the president, who through his casual conversations with friends and associates sometimes seems to hint that a shake-up could come at a moment's notice. Aides said they strive to avoid appearing "weak" or "low-energy" - two of Trump's least favorite attributes. Staffers buzz privately about who is up and who is down, with many eagerly gossiping about which poor colleague gets an unflattering portrayal on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." For the past two weeks straight, it has been White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But aides said Trump himself was especially upset by a sketch that cast White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon as the Grim Reaper manipulating the president - who was ultimately relegated to a miniature desk, playing dolefully with an expandable toy. President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn... President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn... On Monday afternoon, as speculation of a staff shake-up was rife on cable news channels, Trump made clear to a small group of reporters what he thought of his chief of staff: "Reince is doing a great job. Not a good job. A great job," the president said. "None of this is normal," said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist and top official in former president George W. Bush's White House, who has been highly critical of Trump and ticked through controversies that included the false White House statements and the administration's halted travel ban targeting seven majority-Muslim countries. "The incompetence, the sloppiness and the leaking is unprecedented." The ongoing saga of Michael Flynn - which left the White House paralyzed for much of the weekend and into Monday - encapsulates the problems. As scrutiny of the national security adviser has intensified over the past few days amid reports that he had misled colleagues about his talks of sanctions with a Russian envoy, administration officials found themselves in an uncomfortable holding pattern, unsure about whether to defend him and privately grumbling about the indecisiveness on high. The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially... The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially... The problem: Trump had yet to weigh in, and aides and advisers were loathe to take sides without knowing for certain whether their often mercurial and erratic boss wanted to keep Flynn or cut him loose. On Monday, after Trump made it through a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau without being asked about Flynn, a group of reporters gathered outside Spicer's office for more than 80 minutes. Spicer twice declined to answer questions about Flynn. When White House chief of staff Reince Priebus walked by, he was asked whether the president still had confidence in Flynn. Priebus gave no answer. Not long after, Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, said the president has "full confidence" in Flynn. Yet a few minutes later Spicer issued an official - and conflicting - statement, saying Trump "is evaluating the situation." Late Monday night, the White House announced that Flynn had resigned. In an administration where proximity to Trump is power, aides, advisers and visitors often mill about in the West Wing, lingering long after their scheduled appointments have ended. "It's a campaign administration," said someone who recently paid a visit to the White House. "You walk in and there's a pastor from Des Moines, Iowa and a couple of small business guys. You're waiting for the cats and dogs to walk through." The White House has also struggled to fill the top West Wing post of communications director, which was left vacant when Trump campaign communications adviser Jason Miller abruptly resigned in the final weeks of the transition. Spicer, the press secretary, also has been filling the communications director job, which is more of a long-term planning and strategy post - a double-duty assignment has left him beleaguered and battling on several fronts. Several candidates have turned the job down, including Brian Jones, who said no after a preliminary approach by the White House. Jones, a former communicators director on Senator John McCain's (R-Ariz.) 2008 presidential bid and a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012, declined to comment. The administration has also reached out to Ann Marie Hauser, the deputy staff director of the Senate Republican Conference and longtime Hill veteran. Christopher Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trump who on Sunday publicly criticized Priebus in television and print interviews as being "in way over his head," received calls from both the chief of staff and Jared Kushner - Trump's son-in-law, senior adviser and enforcer - and said Monday that he thought the White House was working to remedy its challenges. "My personal view is they know that they can improve in the area of their messaging, and they're working quickly to do it," said Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, a conservative website, and a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Other supporters of Trump say too much of the senior staff's attention seems to be taken up by internal conflicts. Only a handful of ambassadorships have been announced so far, for instance, and some major Republican donors in line for such posts are privately complaining that they have felt cut off from Priebus, after having enjoyed regular contact with him when he was Republican National Committee chairman. Edward Rollins, a former White House adviser to Ronald Reagan, said part of the problem for Trump's team is that so many top officials are "big, national personalities where everything they do is amplified." "The real problem here is you have a bunch of people who were pretty much unknown four months ago, and now they're all characters on 'Saturday Night Live,' " Rollins said. Outreach to Capitol Hill has also faced some setbacks. Lawmakers are comfortable with Vice President Pence - a former House member who regularly attends a weekly Tuesday lunch of Senate Republicans - but wonder how much influence he will ultimately wield with the president on big decisions. Trump's legislative affairs team - headed by Rick Dearborn and Marc Short, both veterans of the Hill - is also considered well-liked, disciplined and professional. But congressional staffers say they have been given advance notice about some executive orders on topics such as cybersecurity and Guantanamo Bay that have never materialized, a delay they attribute to chaos within the West Wing. There is also grumbling about Boris Epshteyn, special assistant to the president, who has started attending a Monday afternoon meeting of House communicators as the administration's liaison. Several aides said Epshteyn simply parrots the White House line - that everything is going great - and seems to resist detailed questions from Hill staffers. "The meetings are good opportunity to have open lines of communication between the White House and Republicans on the Hill," said Epshteyn, who is also assistant communications director for surrogate operations. "The response we've received from the Hill has been overwhelmingly positive." On Monday, according to someone in the room, a staffer asked Epshteyn about conflicting news reports that the White House was considering rewriting its controversial travel ban executive order. Epshteyn said that nothing was off the table but that the group shouldn't necessarily believe all of the reports. When the aide asked if, at least, Hill staff could receive 24 hours notice on any changes, the room tittered, and Epshteyn joked that he was sure he would read about the exchange the next day in the media. "I kind of resent that," the aide said, quietly. After the meeting, however, Epshteyn walked over the staffer, introduced himself, and the two had a pleasant conversation. The Washington Post's Abby Phillip, Jenna Johnson and Robert Costa contributed to this report.

Editor's Note: Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both. After publication, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Post that Stephen Bannon did not travel to see Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on the evening of Jan. 28. - Fred Hiatt On the evening of Saturday, Jan. 28, as airport protests raged over President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, the man charged with implementing the order, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, had a plan. He would issue a waiver for lawful permanent residents, aka green-card holders, from the seven majority-Muslim countries whose citizens had been banned from entering the United States. White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon wanted to stop Kelly in his tracks. Bannon paid a personal and unscheduled visit to Kelly's Department of Homeland Security office to deliver an order: Don't issue the waiver. Kelly, according to two administration officials familiar with the confrontation, refused to comply with Bannon's instruction. That was the beginning of a weekend of negotiations among senior Trump administration staffers that led, on Sunday, to a decision by Trump to temporarily freeze the issuance of executive orders. The confrontation between Bannon and Kelly pitted a political operator against a military disciplinarian. Respectfully but firmly, the retired general and longtime Marine told Bannon that despite his high position in the White House and close relationship with Trump, the former Breitbart chief was not in Kelly's chain of command, two administration officials said. If the president wanted Kelly to back off from issuing the waiver, Kelly would have to hear it from the president directly, he told Bannon. The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Donald Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers... The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Donald Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers... Bannon left Kelly's office without getting satisfaction. Trump didn't call Kelly to tell him to hold off. Kelly issued the waiver late Saturday night, although it wasn't officially announced until the following day. That did not end the dispute. About 2 a.m. Sunday morning, according to the two officials, a conference call of several top officials was convened to discuss the ongoing confusion over the executive order and the anger from Cabinet officials over their lack of inclusion in the process in advance. On the call were Bannon, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, White House Counsel Donald McGahn, national security adviser Michael Flynn, Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State designee Rex Tillerson, who had not yet been confirmed. One White House official and one administration official told me that Kelly, Mattis and Tillerson presented a united front and complained about the process that led to the issuance of the immigration executive order, focusing on their near-complete lack of consultation as well as the White House's reluctance to make what they saw as common-sense revisions, such as exempting green-card holders. Bannon and Miller pushed back, defending the White House's actions and explaining that the process and substance of the order had been kept to a close circle because the Trump administration had not yet installed its own officials in key government roles and other officials were still getting settled into place. If the first two weeks of the Trump presidency has shown anything, it's that chief strategist Steve Bannon has outmaneuvered his White House rivals, Cabinet secretaries and even Republican leaders in Congress.

If the first two weeks of the Trump presidency has shown anything, it's that chief strategist Steve Bannon has outmaneuvered his White House rivals, Cabinet secretaries and even Republican leaders in Congress. But Bannon is just getting started; he's got a longer-term strategy to dominate White... Flynn, according to the White House official, partially sided with the Cabinet officials, arguing that they should be included in the process, even if the White House ultimately decided not to adopt their recommendations. "Flynn's argument was a process argument, that we are unnecessarily putting these guys in a tough position," the White House official said. "If you are going to ignore them, you have to at least give them a chance to say their piece." Later on Sunday, a larger senior staff meeting was convened with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Trump himself, where all tried to make sense of the process and chart a path forward. The president made a decision at that meeting that, following the already scheduled rollout of a executive order on regulatory reforms, all other executive orders would be held up until a process was established that included the input of key officials outside the White House. "We have to evaluate the way we get input from the Cabinet secretaries affected before we do things," the White House official said. The pause appeared to end Friday, when Trump signed an executive order and a memorandum on financial regulation. As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who deliberate on... As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who deliberate on... The weekend's events were the first major dust-up between the White House political leadership and the powerful figures Trump has appointed to head the national security bureaucracies. The Cabinet members stood up for themselves and their agencies and successfully pushed for a policy tweak that the administration later embraced in a memorandum to "clarify" the executive order. The Cabinet members also demonstrated that they had something to offer the White House besides their policy input; they are the most credible spokespeople for controversial White House policies in the eyes of the public. On Tuesday, Kelly gave the White House badly needed political cover by holding a news conference and strongly defending the immigration executive order. "This is not, I repeat, not, a ban on Muslims," Kelly said. "We cannot gamble with American lives. I will not gamble with American lives. These orders are a matter of national security, and it is my sworn responsibility as secretary of homeland security to protect and defend the American people," he said. He said the DHS would implement the order "humanely," that the DHS lawyers had been involved in preparing the order and that he did have some advance notice, denying reports he found out about it being signed while he was on an airplane. "We knew it was coming. It wasn't a surprise," Kelly said. Minutes later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at the daily briefing that "there was proper coordination and preparation" between the White House and the DHS. If the White House is now serious about working with the Cabinet, that's a positive sign and means that this series of events had a constructive impact on policymaking. But there's a good chance that this won't be the last time Kelly, Mattis and Tillerson will have to confront Bannon and Miller. Score their first battle as a tie.

In November 2015, Stephen Bannon - then the executive chairman of Breitbart News - was hosting a satellite radio show. His guest was Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who opposed President Barack Obama's plan to resettle some Syrian refugees in the United States. "We need to put a stop on refugees until we can vet," Zinke said. Bannon cut him off. "Why even let 'em in?" he asked. Bannon said that vetting refugees from Muslim-majority countries would cost money and time. "Can't that money be used in the United States?" he said. "Should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the world?" In the years before Bannon grabbed the world's attention as President Donald Trump's chief White House strategist, he was developing and articulating a fiery populist vision for remaking the United States and its role in the world. Bannon's past statements, aired primarily on Breitbart and other conservative platforms, serve as a road map for the controversial agenda that has roiled Washington and shaken the global order during Trump's first two weeks in office. Now, at the center of power in the White House, Bannon is moving quickly to turn his ideas into policy, helping direct the biggest decisions of Trump's administration. The withdrawal from a major trade pact. A ban on all visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries. And - in an echo of that conversation with Zinke, who is now Trump's nominee for interior secretary - there was a temporary ban on all new refugees. The result has been intense fury from Democrats, discomfort among many Republicans, and a growing sense of unease in the world that Trump intends to undermine an America-centered world that has lasted 70 years. This sense of turmoil, welcomed by many Trump supporters as proof that the new president is following through on his vow to jolt Washington, reflects the sort of transformation that Bannon has long called for. That worldview, which Bannon laid out in interviews and speeches over the past several years, hinges largely on Bannon's belief in American "sovereignty." Bannon said that countries should protect their citizens and their essence by reducing immigration, legal and illegal, and pulling back from multinational agreements. At the same time, Bannon was concerned that the United States and the "Judeo-Christian West" were in a war against an expansionist Islamic ideology - but they were losing the war by not recognizing what it was. Bannon said this fight was so important, it was worth overlooking differences and rivalries with countries like Russia. It is not yet clear how far Bannon will be able to go to enact his agenda. His early policy moves have been marred by administrative chaos. But his worldview calls for bigger changes than those already made. In the past, Bannon had wondered aloud whether the country was ready to follow his lead. Now, he will find out. "Is that grit still there, that tenacity, that we've seen on the battlefields . . . fighting for something greater than themselves?" Bannon said in another radio interview last May, before he joined the Trump campaign. That, said Bannon, is "one of the biggest open questions in this country." Bannon, 62, is a former Navy officer and Goldman Sachs banker who made a fortune after he acquired a share of the royalties from a fledgling TV show called "Seinfeld." In the past 15 years, he shifted into entertainment and conservative media, making films about Ronald Reagan and Sarah Palin and then taking a lead role at Breitbart News. At Breitbart, Bannon cemented his role as a champion of the alt-right, the anti-globalism movement that has attracted support from white supremacists and found a home on the far-right website. Bannon also forged a rapport with Trump, interviewing the businessman-candidate on his show and then, in August 2016, joining the campaign as chief executive. Now, Bannon has become one of the most powerful men in America. And he's not afraid to say so. In interviews with reporters since Trump's election, Bannon has eschewed the traditional it's-all-about-the-boss humility of presidential staffers. "Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power," he told the Hollywood Reporter in November, embracing the comparisons of him to those figures. In the same interview, Bannon compared himself to a powerful aide to England's Henry VIII - an aide who helped engineer a world-shaking move of his era, the split of the Church of England from the Catholic Church. "I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors," Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter. To explore Bannon's worldview, The Washington Post reviewed hours of radio interviews that Bannon conducted while hosting a Breitbart radio talk show, as well as speeches and interviews he has given since 2014. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment made on Tuesday afternoon. In his public statements, Bannon espoused a basic idea that Trump would later seize as the centerpiece of his campaign. While others saw the world rebounding from the financial crisis of 2008, Bannon just saw it becoming more divided by class. The elites that had caused the crisis - or, at least, failed to stop it - were now rising higher. Everyone else was being left behind. "The middle class, the working men and women in the world . . . are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos," Bannon said in a 2014 speech to a conference at the Vatican in a recording obtained by BuzzFeed. Davos is a Swiss ski resort that hosts an annual conclave of wealthy and powerful people. Bannon blamed both major political parties for this system and set out to force his ideas on an unwilling Republican leadership. What he wanted, he said again and again, was "sovereignty." Both in the United States and in its traditional allies in Western Europe. On one of the first Breitbart Radio shows, in early November 2015, Bannon praised the growing movement in Britain to exit the European Union. He said that the British had joined the EU merely as a trading federation but that it had grown into a force that had stripped Britons of sovereignty "in every aspect important to their own life." Bannon has been supportive of similar movements in other European countries to pull out of the union. Trump has echoed those sentiments in his first few days as president. It is a remarkable shift in U.S. policy: After decades of building multinational alliances as a guarantee of peace, now the White House has indicated it may undermine them. Bannon, in his 2014 speech to the Vatican, cast this as a return to a better past. "I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors," Bannon said. "And that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it's what can see us forward." In the case of the United States, Bannon was skeptical of multinational trade pacts, saying that they ceded control. In a radio interview in November 2015, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., agreed with Bannon. "We shouldn't be tying ourselves down like Gulliver in the land of Lilliputians with so many strings a guy can't move," said Sessions, who is now Trump's nominee to become attorney general. He was referring to a scene from the novel "Gulliver's Travels" in which the hero is tied down by a race of tiny men. "That is where we are heading, and it's not necessary." One solution put forward by Bannon: the United States should pursue bilateral trade agreements - one country at a time - rather than multi-country agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership supported by Obama. He suggested as much to Trump himself, when the candidate appeared on his show in November 2015. "Trump brings [a deal] back to the Senate and gets his bilateral trade deal with Taiwan or with Japan approved by two-thirds of the Senate," Bannon said. "And you have to go argue, 'Hey this is why it's a good deal.' And that's the way the Founders wanted it." On a March 2016 episode, Bannon said that restoring sovereignty meant reducing immigration. In his radio shows, he criticized the federal H-1B visa programs that permit U.S. companies to fill technical positions with workers from overseas. The "progressive plutocrats in Silicon Valley," Bannon said, want unlimited ability to go around the world and bring people back to the United States. "Engineering schools," Bannon said, "are all full of people from South Asia, and East Asia. ... They've come in here to take these jobs." Meanwhile, Bannon said, American students "can't get engineering degrees; they can't get into these graduate schools because they are all foreign students. When they come out, they can't get a job." "Don't we have a problem with legal immigration?" asked Bannon repeatedly. "Twenty percent of this country is immigrants. Is that not the beating heart of this problem?" he said, meaning the problem of native-born Americans being unable to find jobs and rising wages. In another show, Bannon had complained to Trump that so many Silicon Valley chief executives were South Asian or Asian. This was a rare time when Trump - normally receptive to Bannon's ideas on-air - pushed back. "I still want people to come in," Trump said. "But I want them to go through the process." So far, Trump has made no changes to the high-skilled visa program. This week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the Trump administration may reexamine the program. Even as Bannon was calling for a general retreat from multi-national alliances, however, he was warning of the need for a new alliance - involving only a subset of the world's countries. The "Judeo-Christian West" was at war, he said, but didn't seem to understand it yet. "There is a major war brewing, a war that's already global," Bannon said at the Vatican in 2014, at a time when the Islamic State was gaining territory. "Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is - and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it - will be a day where you will rue that we didn't act." Bannon has given few details about the mechanics of the war he thinks the West should fight. But he has been clear that it is urgent enough to take priority over other rivalries and worries. In his talk at the Vatican, Bannon was asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bannon's answer was two-sided. "I think that Putin and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand," he said. But, Bannon said, there were bigger concerns than Russia - and there was something to admire in Putin's call for more traditional values. "However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation - I'm not saying we can put [Russia] on a back burner - but I think we have to deal with first things first," Bannon said. If Bannon succeeds, Bannon's own comparison, to England's Thomas Cromwell, might be apt - to a point. "The analogy - if it's going to work - is that Bannon has his own agenda, which he will try to use Trump for, and will try to exploit the power that Trump has given him, without his master always noticing," said Diarmaid MacCulloch, a professor of history at England's Oxford University. But Cromwell was later executed, after Henry VIII turned against him. For a man like that, MacCulloch said, power is always tenuous: "It's very much dependent on the favor of the king."

President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates' contact with Russia during the presidential election, and said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks and maybe even Hillary Clinton instead. His tweets came just hours before a potentially politically damaging hearing in which FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers planned to testify on allegations of Russian hacking and whether there were any connections between Moscow and Trump's campaign. "The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" Trump tweeted early Monday, as news coverage on the Russia allegations dominated the morning's cable news. "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" He also suggested, without evidence, that Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. U.S. intelligence officials have not publicly raised the possibility of contacts between the Clintons and Moscow. Officials investigating the matter have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Trump's election bid. "What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians?" he tweeted. "Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?" Monday's hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, one of several congressional panels probing allegations of Russian meddling, could allow for the greatest public accounting to date of investigations that have shadowed the Trump administration in its first two months. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in the campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. The FBI has also been investigating ties between Russia and Trump advisers and associates during the campaign. The top two lawmakers on the House intelligence committee said Sunday that documents the Justice Department and FBI delivered late last week offered no evidence that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, the president's New York City headquarters. But the panel's ranking Democrat says the material offers circumstantial evidence that American citizens colluded with Russians in Moscow's efforts to interfere in the presidential election. "There was circumstantial evidence of collusion; there is direct evidence, I think, of deception," Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on NBC's "Meet the Press." ''There's certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation." Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, said: "For the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses." The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was... The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was... "We know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They're also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and over in Europe," he said on "Fox News Sunday." The Senate Intelligence Committee has scheduled a similar hearing for later in the month. It is not clear how much new information will emerge Monday, and the hearing's open setting unquestionably puts Comey in a difficult situation if he's asked to discuss an ongoing investigation tied to the campaign of the president. At a hearing in January, Comey refused to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation exploring possible connections between Trump associates and Russia, consistent with the FBI's longstanding policy of not publicly discussing its work. His appearances on Capitol Hill since then have occurred in classified settings, often with small groups of lawmakers, and he has made no public statements connected to the Trump campaign or Russia. But Comey may feel compelled to respond to Trump's unproven Twitter assertions that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretapping of Trump Tower during the campaign. Congressional leaders briefed on the matter have said they've seen no indication that that's true, and Obama's top intelligence official, James Clapper, has publicly called the claims false. The Justice Department's disclosure Friday that it had complied with congressional demands for information regarding Trump's wiretapping tweets could allow Comey to avoid questioning by simply saying that the lawmakers already have the information they requested. Yet any lack of detail from Comey will likely be contrasted with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before Election Day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails.

After six weeks spent scrambling to fend off chaos, the Trump White House has found itself in territory familiar to several past administrations: trying to pursue a sense of normality as it conducts an investigation into itself. The decision by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from supervising an FBI probe into Russia’s efforts to influence the presidential campaign — and the Trump campaign and administration’s ties to that country — may have settled one thorny issue. But it left a series of others. The biggest challenge, according to veterans of past administrations of both parties, will be to persuade Americans of the credibility of an investigation into its own activities while avoiding the internal damage that a prolonged investigation can cause for a White House. “It’s very easy to get an atmosphere that’s a combination of paranoia and the desire to please the boss and panicky fear of what’s going to come out next,” Michael Waldman, a speechwriter for President Clinton during that investigation-marred administration, said of the sentiment inside a White House under siege. “It can be very debilitating.” If history holds, Trump and his staff will face two distinct problems. They will have to guard against administration officials becoming more and more fearful about their own futures as they contemplate interviews with the FBI or summonses to appear before congressional committees. Those fears can limit internal cooperation and complicate hiring new staff. At the same time, the administration will have to work harder to propel policy goals to the forefront in a media environment dominated — to this point — by a series of controversies. “White Houses act like 8-year-olds playing soccer — everyone runs to the ball,” said Democratic veteran Mickey Kantor, who served as Clinton’s trade representative and secretary of Commerce. “When you run to the ball, it gets in the way of other work, it disrupts other work,” said Kantor, who said he was not casting judgment on whether Trump or his team had done anything wrong. FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request... FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request... Except for President Obama’s, no recent administration has avoided an independent counsel or special prosecutor investigation since they began sprouting in the Watergate era. So far, the Trump administration has signaled it will not exercise the option of bringing in an outsider to serve as a special prosecutor. Instead, it wants to keep the Russia matter under the control of the president’s and Sessions’ underlings in the Department of Justice. That may mean a more controlled investigation, but it also means the White House itself will be called to answer for every development. “This isn’t and shouldn’t ever be political, much less civil war,” said John Q. Barrett, who served under independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh during the 1980s Iran-Contra investigation, which looked into efforts by Reagan administration officials to use proceeds from arms sales to Iran to finance rebels in Nicaragua. (Both the sales and the financing were barred at the time.) “It should be law enforcement done in a high spotlight, high stakes process,” said Barrett, now a professor of law at St. John’s University in New York City. “There’s always a fever of the moment, and you hope for people on all sides who can sort of not succumb to that.” For those working for the president whose administration is being investigated, the stakes are also personal. During the Clinton administration, multiple investigations were conducted by independent counsels, not only of Bill and Hillary Clinton but also the administration’s secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and of Agriculture. The initial look at the Clintons’ pre-presidential investment in an Arkansas development known as Whitewater morphed into a six-year investigation that ultimately covered the suicide of a White House aide and President Clinton’s affair with a young intern, and prompted impeachment proceedings against him. By the time the probe was formally concluded, weeks before the election of Clinton’s successor, it had been directed by three separate counsels and its cost had ballooned to more than $71 million. Swept into the swirl were White House staffers who were not targets of the investigation but, in effect, informed bystanders. Documents had to be collected, memories had to be jogged, and lawyers had to be consulted even if only to offer advice about talking to investigators or before a grand jury. Many aides were left with mammoth legal bills, despite an absence of culpability. In 1999, with official Washington concerned about the cost and partisanship of such investigations, the independent counsel law was allowed to lapse. Instead of an independent counsel appointed by a panel of appellate judges, the new rules allow the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, either from the Justice Department or an outside lawyer. The scope, too, is narrowed, to criminal activity. The most famous appointment under that procedure came in the 2003 case of I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney who was accused of publicizing the name of a covert CIA officer, Valerie Plame, in retaliation for criticism of the administration by her husband. Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, was brought in as the prosecutor and won the conviction of Libby on four felony counts. Libby’s 30-month sentence was later commuted by President George W. Bush. Fitzgerald had a reputation for independence and was outside the Washington-based Justice hierarchy. (He was selected in large part by his close friend James Comey, then the deputy attorney general and now head of the FBI, one of the agencies looking into Russian election activities.) Sessions’ recusal in the Russian case places the investigation for now in the hands of Dana Boente, a career prosecutor and the acting deputy attorney general. Before Sessions was sworn into office, Boente briefly served as acting attorney general after Trump fired his predecessor, Sally Yates, for refusing to defend the president’s ban on travel from seven mostly Muslim countries. The administration has nominated Rod J. Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, who has a reputation as nonpartisan, to fill the deputy’s job. He would inherit the investigation if he is confirmed. Veterans of past independent investigations said that, without an arms-length prosecutor, the challenge will be to persuade Americans to trust the outcome. Regardless of the independence and integrity shown by Justice Department attorneys, they said, the perception of independence will be lacking. “The biggest thing to me is: Do people believe it,” said Boston-based lawyer Kenneth J. Parsigian, who also served on the Iran-Contra team. The problem, as he noted, is that whoever leads the case will still report to Sessions after it is over. The attorney general recused himself because of his role in the Trump campaign, but only after it became known he had met with the Russian ambassador before the election. “What’s going to satisfy the American people?” Parsigian asked. “If you do an investigation and the answer comes down and 51% of the people don’t believe it, then what was the point?” President Trump, for one, has not seen the need for an independent investigation. Before Sessions recused himself, Trump said he did not think that step was necessary. On Friday his deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated his view to reporters. “The big point here is that the president himself knows what his involvement was, and that's zero,” she said. “And I think he's the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think that's what the story should be focused on.” cathleen.decker@latimes.com Twitter: @cathleendecker

President Donald Trump's explosive allegation that Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the presidential campaign has left him increasingly isolated, with allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration offering no evidence to back him up. On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he had not given Trump any reason to believe he was wiretapped by President Obama. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he had seen no information to support the claim and then went further. He suggested the U.S. president's assertion, made in a series of March 4 tweets, should not be taken at face value. "Are you going to take the tweets literally?" Nunes said. "If so, clearly the president was wrong." But Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News, predicted there would be "some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks." Trump's allegations have put him in a potentially perilous position as congressional investigations into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election — and possible Russian contacts with Trump associates — ramp up. The FBI is also investigating. If no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower emerges, his credibility would be newly damaged. If there is proof that the Obama administration approved monitoring of Trump or his associates, that would suggest the government had reason to be suspicious of their contacts with Russia and a judge had approved the surveillance. President Obama denied that he or his staff had authorized any such surveillance. (March 6, 2017) President Obama denied that he or his staff had authorized any such surveillance. (March 6, 2017) The president, who appears to have made his allegation in a burst of anger, has asked lawmakers to investigate the claim. Lawmakers have since turned the question back toward the administration, asking the Justice Department to provide evidence of wiretapping activity. The Justice Department missed a Monday deadline for providing the information to the House and was given a one-week extension. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who heads the Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee, said the FBI will provide a classified briefing on the matter "at some time in the future." Graham has previously said he would use subpoena power to get information from the FBI about whether a warrant was issued allowing the Obama administration to tap Trump's phones during the campaign. Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told The Associated Press Wednesday that he believes his own online exchanges with a Russian-linked hacker were obtained through a special warrant that allows the government to collect the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign nation. Stone communicated through Twitter direct messages with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who has claimed responsibility for breaching the Democratic National Committee. President Donald Trump is "extremely confident" that the Justice Department will find evidence to back up his claim that former president Barack Obama "had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" during the presidential campaign, even as the White House seeks to discourage the public from taking the... President Donald Trump is "extremely confident" that the Justice Department will find evidence to back up his claim that former president Barack Obama "had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" during the presidential campaign, even as the White House seeks to discourage the public from taking the... Stone said he was unaware at the time that U.S. officials believed the hacker had ties to Russia. He said he is willing to testify before any congressional committee that holds its hearings "in public and not behind closed doors." The House intelligence committee will begin holding public hearings on Monday. Nunes said FBI Director James Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, will testify. Ahead of the hearing, the committee sent a letter to the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency requesting details by Friday about Americans who surfaced in intelligence collections last year. Identities of Americans who show up in U.S. surveillance against foreign targets are generally concealed, but can be unmasked by intelligence agencies in certain circumstances. Those include situations when the communications contain information that a crime has or is about to be committed, when the Americans' identity is necessary to understand the importance of the foreign intelligence collected or when the communication provides information that an American may be an agent of a foreign power. Asked whether Trump's communications may have been swept up in surveillance, Nunes said it was "very possible." Sessions, a staunch supporter of Trump during the campaign, recused himself earlier this month from the Russia investigations after it was revealed that he did not disclose his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States. Asked Wednesday if he had ever briefed Trump on the investigation or given the president any reason to believe he had been wiretapped by the Obama administration, Sessions said, "The answer is no." Trump has said little about his allegations against Obama, largely leaving it to White House aides to explain his inflammatory statements. The White House appeared to be backing away from Trump's claims on Monday, with spokesman Sean Spicer saying the president was referring to general surveillance that may have been approved by the Obama administration. On Tuesday, Spicer said the president was "extremely confident" the Justice Department would provide evidence vindicating him. Graham and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley have both said they will hold up hearings for Rod Rosenstein, Trump's nominee to serve as deputy attorney general, unless they get more information from the FBI. Given Sessions' recusal, Rosenstein would take over responsibility for any probes touching the Trump campaign and Russia's election meddling if he's confirmed. "It's just too bad that we have to go to this length," Grassley said. AP writers Deb Riechmann, Sadie Gurman and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.

The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support President Donald Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. "Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction," Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman, said on "Fox News Sunday." He added, "There was no FISA warrant that I'm aware of to tap Trump Tower" - a reference to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a federal law that governs the issuance of search warrants in U.S. intelligence gathering. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the panel's top Democrat, said, "We are at the bottom of this: There is nothing at the bottom." Nunes and Schiff spoke a day before his panel holds its first public hearing on alleged Russian attempts to interfere in last year's presidential election - a subject that is certain to include discussion of contacts between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned last month after it was revealed that he had privately discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office. Schiff, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," said he expected FBI Director James B. Comey to testify clearly at the hearing that there is no factual basis for Trump's wiretapping claims. "I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase, because what the president said was just patently false," the Democrat said. "It's continuing to grow in terms of damage, and he needs to put an end to this." President Donald Trump defiantly refused to back down Friday from his explosive claim that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones, and sidestepped any blame for the White House decision to highlight an unverified report that Britain helped carry out the alleged surveillance.

President Donald Trump defiantly refused to back down Friday from his explosive claim that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones, and sidestepped any blame for the White House decision to highlight an unverified report that Britain helped carry out the alleged surveillance. In brushing off the diplomatic... The two House leaders did not agree, however, on whether the question of collusion between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives has been settled. Nunes said the new Justice Department documents, submitted in response to a congressional request, included "no evidence of collusion" to swing the election in Trump's favor and repeated previous statements that there is no credible proof that there was any active coordination. The lawmaker said he remained primarily concerned about leaks of U.S. surveillance of conversations between Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. "That's the only crime we know has been committed right now," Nunes said. But Schiff said there was "circumstantial evidence of collusion" at the outset of the congressional investigations into purported Russian election meddling, as well as "direct evidence" that Trump campaign figures sought to deceive the public about their interactions with Russian figures.

President Donald Trump's explosive allegation that Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the presidential campaign has left him increasingly isolated, with allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration offering no evidence to back him up. On Wednesday, Attorney General... "Of course, there's one thing to say there's evidence; there's another thing to say we can prove this or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt," he said. "But there was certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation. The American people have a right to know, and in order to defend ourselves, we need to know whether the circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception is indicative of more." Trump last week refused to back down from his tweets on March 4 that claimed President Barack Obama "had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory" and compared it to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. But no credible evidence has emerged to support those claims, and the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said last week that they have seen nothing that supports the allegation. In a Fox News Channel interview on Thursday, Trump said, "I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks." Nunes said Trump could be referring to new information about whether intelligence officials "unmasked," or identified, U.S. citizens who were captured speaking with foreign officials who are under routine surveillance - a process governed by FISA. "That is very possible, and we don't have the answers to those questions yet," he said. "We had a deadline of Friday for the NSA, FBI and CIA to get us those names that were unmasked through the FISA system. We didn't get those names on Friday, and until we get those names, we can't rule this out." He added that Monday's hearing was "just the beginning" and that he planned to continue looking into who revealed Flynn's communications with Kislyak. "We're trying to get to everyone who, for lack of a better term, was at the crime scene," he said. "We're trying to bring them all in, see what they knew, when they knew it, if they knew about the leaks, if they knew about General Flynn's name being unmasked. These are all questions that we need to get to the bottom of." Trump remains under pressure from members of his own party to back off his claims of illegal wiretapping - particularly after the furor intensified last week when White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that British intelligence may have played a role in the surveillance. Spicer later apologized for the claim and explained that he had repeated an unverified media report. On ABC's "This Week," another Republican on the House Intelligence Committee called on Trump to apologize for accusing Obama of ordering an illegal wiretap. "To quote my 85-year-old father … it never hurts to say you're sorry," said Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a former clandestine agent for the CIA. "I think it helps with our allies. We've got to make sure that we're all working together. We live in a very dangerous world, and we can't do this alone. … It's not just sorry to the president, but also to the U.K. for the claims or the intimation that the U.K. was involved in this, as well. It doesn't hurt. And it takes away from the rest of his agenda." Hurd said that "some folks will probably be frustrated" by the hearing Monday because the officials set to testify, including Comey, might not be able to elaborate on investigative matters: "There may be an active investigation going on, a criminal investigation. And if there's an active criminal investigation, we need to allow law enforcement … do their job." In a separate interview on "This Week," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., focused on the leak of Flynn's communications with Kislyak and said those within the federal government who might have been responsible should undergo lie-detector tests. "It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to the New York Times," Paul said. "There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie-detector tests. And, I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well." Paul said, using a term increasingly favored by conservatives for members of the federal bureaucracy, "You will get a 'deep state.' You will have an intelligence community that has enormous power if that happens." Hurd, however, pushed back on the notion that a deep state was seeking to undermine Trump. He said, "I spent 9 1/2 years as an undercover officer. I was the dude in the back alleys at 4 in the morning collecting intelligence to protect our homeland. … The men and the women in the CIA, they do their job regardless of who is in the White House. Same for NSA. Same for FBI. These men and women are putting themselves in harm's way." If true, the alleged campaign of political interference by Russia, Hurd said, would "go down in the history of Mother Russia as the greatest covert action campaign" it had ever pursued. "It created a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the White House, the intelligence community and the American public," he said. "And that's why, as we go through this review and investigation, it has to be bipartisan. It has to be thorough. And it has to be thoughtful, because we are feeding into this covert-action narrative that the Russians are trying to create."

President Trump urged Senate Republican leaders Wednesday to be prepared to tear up the rules of the Senate and "go nuclear" if Democrats try to block his Supreme Court nominee from winning confirmation - complicating the beginning of Judge Neil Gorsuch's delicate courtship of the lawmakers who will decide his fate. As Gorsuch began a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, Trump said at the White House that if the gridlock of recent years persists in the Senate, Republicans should move to change the rules of the chamber to permit the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee with a simple majority vote. "I would say, 'If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,' " Trump said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). "Because that would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect. I would say it's up to Mitch, but I would say, 'Go for it.' " Some Democrats are indeed pushing to block Gorsuch, citing not only Republicans' refusal last year to move ahead with then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, but also their concern about the constitutionality of Trump's travel ban for refugees and foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. But coming on a day when some key Democratic senators from conservative states signaled openness to voting for Gorsuch, Trump's words threw a divisive wrench into efforts to improve bipartisan relations, which have sunk to historically low levels in Congress. His comments echoed previous remarks nudging McConnell to abandon long-standing Senate rules that the Republican leader does not take lightly. Republican leaders are hopeful they can secure the eight crossover votes they would need to overcome Democratic resistance without changing Senate rules, which can require a 60-vote majority for Supreme Court confirmations. Many Republican senators sought to distance themselves from Trump's talk about going nuclear. Federal Judge Neil Gorsuch is President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Antonin Scalia's death. Federal Judge Neil Gorsuch is President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Antonin Scalia's death. "I don't think it's going to be necessary," said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), McConnell's top deputy. "It'd be better to let it cool for a while," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). Cornyn and Hatch were among the senators Gorsuch met with on his whirlwind first day. The U.S. court of appeals judge arrived on the Senate side of the Capitol accompanied by Vice President Pence and a team of aides including former senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who recently served in the Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), a centrist Democrat who met with Gorsuch on Wednesday, said the nuclear option is "wrong." "It diminishes the true balance and effectiveness of the Senate," said Manchin, who remains open to voting for Gorsuch. Other Democrats were more hostile to the nominee. In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Gorsuch of favoring corporate interests over regular people and injecting a conservative ideology into his legal decisions. "I have very serious doubts that Judge Neil Gorsuch is up to the job," said Schumer, who has committed to forcing Gorsuch to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle before getting to a final up-or-down vote. The White House asked that Gorsuch meet with Schumer, but aides said he declined in order to learn more first about the nominee's record. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), a potential swing vote, said he is "quite concerned" about Gorsuch's views on voting rights and campaign finance laws. It remains unclear whether Senate Democrats will be able to band together to stop Gorsuch. Manchin and a handful of other centrist Democrats are up for reelection in states that Trump won easily. Voting for Trump's Supreme Court nominee could endear them to some of the many Republican voters in their states. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. "I'm not counting votes, and I can't give you any insight on that," said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who calls the spot on the court Gorsuch is trying to fill a "stolen seat," a reference to Obama's failed Garland nomination. Gorsuch's first call after being nominated was to Garland, "out of respect," his spokesman Ron Bonjean said Wednesday. Senate Republicans offered strong praise for Gorsuch, whom they have sought to label as "mainstream," in an effort to counter Democratic criticism. "This is a judge who's known for deciding cases based on how the law is actually written, not how he wishes it were written, even when it leads to results that conflict with his own political beliefs," McConnell argued in a Senate floor speech. By urging McConnell and his fellow Republicans to "go nuclear," Trump was referring to the common name for a game plan to circumvent filibusters. The "nuclear option" calls for breaking the Senate's long-standing tradition of requiring a two-thirds majority to change the chamber's rules. The rule requiring a 60-vote majority to approve Gorsuch could be changed with a simple-majority vote - and then Republicans would have the votes to approve his nomination. "I think it would be a mistake to go to a simple majority," said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), one of the Democrats whom Republicans are targeting to break ranks and support Gorsuch. "I'm going to bring him in and interview him," Tester said of Gorsuch. "I'm going to look at his decisions, going to determine whether he understands the Constitution, rural America, women's rights and all that stuff. I've read a few decisions - the one decision on end of life distresses me, but I want to look at more than just that." Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said he also will study Gorsuch's legal opinions and evaluating his temperament. Unlike Schumer and Merkley, Coons didn't endorse forcing Gorsuch to face a 60-vote threshold for advancement. But he acknowledged that it probably is the bar Gorsuch will have to clear. After his morning meeting with McConnell, Pence walked Gorsuch around the Capitol, stopping in the Rotunda, where he took a picture with high school students who work as Senate pages. Gorsuch, who grew up in Colorado and the District of Columbia, once served as a page, said an adult supervisor of the pages. On his way out of the Rotunda, a group of eighth-grade girls from the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda waved and said "congratulations" to him. He shook one of their hands and said: "Thank you very much. Someday you'll be doing this." Neil M. Gorsuch, a highly regarded conservative jurist best known for upholding religious liberty rights in the legal battles over Obamacare, is President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Neil M.

Gorsuch is expected to hold many more meetings with senators over the next several weeks. He will have to appear the Senate Judiciary Committee in closely watched hearings where Democrats are expected to grill him over his record and his views on a range of hot-button issues. In the meantime, both Republican and Democratic senators seem to agree on at least one thing: No one can predict what the president is going to say or do to suddenly upend the debate over Gorsuch - or other pressing matters. "You think you're going to tell Mr. Trump he's wrong on something? The bottom line is, he's going to speak up what he believes," Manchin said.

Senate Republicans moved aggressively Wednesday to push through several of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees, the latest round in an escalating showdown with Democrats trying to thwart President Trump's administration. Republicans lashed out angrily at Democrats trying to stall the president's nominees at the committee level, suspending the rules to approve two nominees, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., for secretary of health and human services and Steve Mnuchin to lead the Treasury. Republicans also advanced the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general, and they finalized confirmation of former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of state by a vote of 56 to 43. The day was not without its setbacks for Republicans, however. Two GOP senators, Lisa Murkowski, Alaska, and Susan Collins, Maine, signaled they do not plan to support the president's nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos - leaving Democrats one vote shy of the number needed to doom her nomination. Both senators cited their uncertainty about whether DeVos, an avid supporter of charter schools and school vouchers, is sufficiently committed to helping public schools. The drama on Capitol Hill unfolded at a time when Democrats, under intense pressure from liberal activists, have become increasingly emboldened to block Trump's agenda and appointees. Democrats were enraged by the administration's executive order issued over the weekend to bar travel to the United States by those from seven majority-Muslim countries. They galvanized around the firing of acting attorney general Sally Yates, who was dismissed for refusing to enforce the ban. And some Democrats were also angered by the president's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night, arguing that Republicans cannot expect them to swiftly approve the selection after their blockade of then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Wednesday that they intend to vote against the confirmation of President Donald Trump's education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos, giving Democrats two of at least three Republican votes they would need to block her appointment. Republican... Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Wednesday that they intend to vote against the confirmation of President Donald Trump's education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos, giving Democrats two of at least three Republican votes they would need to block her appointment. Republican... Lawmakers began meeting with Gorsuch on Wednesday. Although several moderate Democrats said they remain open to the federal appeals judge, others, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed to block him with a filibuster, which Republicans would need 60 votes to overcome. Meanwhile, Trump urged Senate Republican leaders Wednesday to be prepared to tear up the rules of the Senate and "go nuclear" if Democrats try to block Gorsuch - that is, change long-standing Senate rules to permit the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee with a simple majority vote. "I would say, 'If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,' " Trump said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "Because that would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect. I would say it's up to Mitch, but I would say, 'Go for it.' " Several Democrats did side with Republicans to approve Tillerson, including senators from states that Trump won during the election: Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.). Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., also supported Tillerson.

Seats are empty Jan. 31, 2017, in the Senate Finance Committee hearing room on Capitol Hill in Washington after Senate Democrats boycotted planned committee votes for the nominations of Steven T. Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and Thomas Price as secretary of Health and Human Services. There is little Democrats can do to prevent final confirmation of any of Trump's picks because the GOP needs only 51 votes to approve them in the full Senate and there are 52 Republican senators. With Tillerson, six high-ranking Trump nominees have been approved by the full Senate: Elaine Chao as transportation secretary; retired generals John Kelly and Jim Mattis at the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon; Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA; and Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Over in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans celebrated Sessions' approval on a party-line vote of 11 to 9, with Democrats present and opposing his nomination. "Senator Sessions has devoted his life to public service, and his qualifications cannot be questioned," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a statement following the Sessions vote. "He has a history of protecting and defending the Constitution and the rule of law for all people." But a committee hearing to approve Trump's pick for the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, was delayed after Democrats failed to show up. So was a hearing to vet Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., to lead the Office of Management and Budget, which was delayed Wednesday, although the delay happened before the panel convened. And on Tuesday, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of former Texas governor Rick Perry to be energy secretary and Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to be interior secretary. Republicans came to the aid of Trump's nominees after Democrats dipped into their procedural arsenal to stall many of them at committee hearings on Monday, echoing growing liberal anger in the streets. "Democrats are going to keep fighting back," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. "We are going to stand with people across the country. And we will keep pushing Republicans to put country above party and stand with us." That stance was met with praise from liberal activists, labor unions and constituents. "We're seeing someone who came into office with a historic popular vote loss come in and push a radical, unconstitutional agenda," said Kurt Walters, the campaign director of the transparency group Demand Progress. "Yes, radical and bold tactics are what senators should be using in response." At Senate Finance on Wednesday morning, Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, rammed through Mnuchin and Price after Democrats did not show up for that hearing. Their nominations head to the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote, although it is unclear when that will occur. "Republicans on this committee showed up to do our jobs. Yesterday, rather than accept anything less than their desired outcome, our Democrat colleagues chose to cower in the hallway and hold a press conference," Hatch charged. Incensed by the Democratic boycott, GOP members spent Tuesday exploring how they could quickly approve Price and Mnuchin and punish Democrats for their surprise move. Committee staffers scoured the panel's lengthy rule book and discovered it permits the majority party to temporarily suspend the rules and meet without Democrats. Hatch said he consulted the Senate parliamentarian, who serves as a referee on all disputes in committees and on the Senate floor, who said doing so was within bounds. After weeks of back-and-forth about Trump's nominees, "the boycott was the last straw," explained Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., who pushed staffers to explore their options. "The ultimate result was not in doubt. Getting to the ultimate was in doubt," he added. "For us, it was going to get done. Why not find a way to do it since they weren't going to show up for a committee meeting? To them, slowing down the process just gave them the time to do that and try to make cases against us." Democrats were told Wednesday morning that Finance would reconvene. But they were not given any indication that Hatch would alter the rules, according to a spokesman for Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking Democrat on the committee. Democrats complained that Mnuchin misled the committee by initially misstating his personal wealth on a financial disclosure form and misrepresenting under oath how OneWest Bank, which he led, scrutinized mortgage documents. And Wyden pointed to discounted stock buys Price made in a health-care company, first reported by the Wall Street Journal. "We felt it was important to say we need this information to do our job," Wyden said Wednesday after Hatch forced the party-line vote. Other Republicans dismissed accusations that the GOP is bending Senate procedure to quickly confirm Trump's picks. "I think people expect senators to show up for work and be there. It's unfortunate," said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. Democrats defended their actions as a necessary step to register their frustration after a small group of Republicans refused to allow them to question the nominees once new information came to light. Over at the Environment and Public Works Committee, where Pruitt is being considered, Republicans vented their frustration at the lack of Democrats who came. A GOP aide displayed a chart designed to show how quickly past EPA nominees were confirmed. Notably missing, however, was Obama's second EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy. Nominated in March 2013, McCarthy was not confirmed until July of that year - at one point, Republicans on the Environment Committee boycotted a meeting to demand that McCarthy answer more questions. "That was not a new president, newly elected," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., arguing that the GOP boycott differed because it happened during Obama's second term. "A newly elected president, I believe, has a right to their Cabinet." The Washington Post's Sean Sullivan and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court nominee in a quarter-century. He's known on the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals for clear, colloquial writing, advocacy for court review of government regulations, defense of religious freedom and skepticism toward law enforcement. "Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support," Trump declared, announcing the nomination in his first televised prime-time address from the White House. Gorsuch's nomination was cheered by conservatives wary of Trump's own fluid ideology. If confirmed by the Senate, he will fill the seat left vacant by the death last year of Antonin Scalia, long the right's most powerful voice on the high court. With Scalia's wife, Maureen, sitting in the audience, Trump took care to praise the late justice. Gorsuch followed, calling Scalia a "lion of the law." President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Jan. 31, 2017. Gorsuch thanked Trump for entrusting him with "a most solemn assignment." And he said, "Standing here in a house of history, I'm acutely aware of my own imperfections and pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution of laws of this great country." Some Democrats, still smarting over Trump's unexpected victory in the presidential election, have vowed to mount a vigorous challenge to nearly any nominee to what they view as the court's "stolen seat." President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland for the vacancy after Scalia's death, but Senate Republicans refused to consider the pick, saying the seat should be filled only after the November election. Trump's choice of Gorsuch marks perhaps the most significant decision of his young presidency, one with ramifications that could last long after he leaves office. After an uneven start to his presidency, including the chaotic rollout last week of a controversial refugee and immigration ban, Trump's selection of Gorsuch appeared to proceed with little drama. For some Republicans, the prospect of filling one or more Supreme Court seats over the next four years has helped ease their concerns about Trump's experience and temperament. Three justices are in their late 70s and early 80s, and a retirement would offer Trump the opportunity to cement conservative dominance of the court for many years. If confirmed, Gorsuch will restore the court to the conservative tilt it held with Scalia on the bench. But he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on abortion, gay marriage and other issues in which the court has been divided 5-4 in recent years. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch has won praise from conservatives for his defense of religious freedom. In two cases that involved the contraception mandate under the Obama health care law, he sided with businesses and nonprofit groups that voiced religious objections to the requirement that they provide cost-free birth control to women covered under their health plans. The judge also has written opinions that question 30 years of Supreme Court rulings that allow federal agencies to interpret laws and regulations. Gorsuch has said that federal bureaucrats have been allowed to accumulate too much power at the expense of Congress and the courts. Like Scalia, Gorsuch identifies himself as a judge who tries to decide cases by interpreting the Constitution and laws as they were understood when written. He also has raised questions about criminal laws in a way that resembles Scalia's approach to criminal law. University of Michigan law professor Richard Primus said Gorsuch "may be the closest thing the new generation of conservative judges has to Antonin Scalia." Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia.

Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George... Gorsuch, like the other eight justices on the court, has an Ivy League law degree. The Colorado native earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in three years, then a law degree from Harvard. He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White, a fellow Coloradan, and Anthony Kennedy before earning a philosophy degree at Oxford University and working for a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm. He served for two years in George W. Bush's Department of Justice before the president nominated him to the appeals court. His mother was Anne Gorsuch, who was head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Reagan administration. Gorsuch is expected to face intense scrutiny from Democrats. Some liberals have demanded that Democrats block any Trump choice, underscoring the deep partisan discord surging through Washington.

Gorsuch, a highly regarded conservative jurist best known for upholding religious liberty rights in the legal battles over Obamacare, is President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Gorsuch was among the 21 possible choices for the court Trump released during the campaign. Other finalists also came from that list, including Thomas Hardiman, who serves alongside Trump's sister on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and William Pryor, a federal appeals court judge and Alabama's attorney general from 1997 to 2004. If Democrats decide to filibuster Gorsuch's nomination, his fate could rest in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump has encouraged McConnell to change the rules of the Senate and make it impossible to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee — a change known in the Senate as the "nuclear option." A conservative group already has announced plans to begin airing $2 million worth of ads in support of the nominee in Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota, four states that Trump won and in which Democrats will be defending their Senate seats in 2018.

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 11-9 to advance the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week. Republicans, who need only a majority vote to approve him, control 52 of the Senate's 100 seats, and Democrats have thus far failed to convince anyone on the other side of the aisle to oppose Sessions. The committee vote, which passed along party lines, comes at a tumultuous time for the Department of Justice. On Monday, President Donald Trump fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover, after she refused to defend his controversial immigration order. Senate Democrats lambasted the move as improper and said it called into question whether Sessions would enforce laws with which the president took issue. Republicans, meanwhile, asserted that Yates was the one to have acted wrongly in refusing to defend an order that the Justice Department's own Office of Legal Counsel had deemed lawful. The dispute led to a bitter Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, and the panel ultimately decided it would wait a day to vote on Sessions' nomination. On Wednesday, Democrats again launched bitter attacks against Sessions before the vote. The process, along with fights over other Cabinet nominees, has frustrated Trump, who took to Twitter on Tuesday to decry Democrats. "When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet!" he wrote. "They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work!" Until Sessions can be confirmed, the Justice Department is being led by Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia who was chosen to lead in Yates place. Boente, a longtime Justice Department lawyer nominated by President Barack Obama for his U.S. attorney's job, rescinded Yates' directive not to defend Trump's immigration order. Alabama Sen.

Provided they are confirmed, Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney from Maryland, will serve as the deputy attorney general, the No. 2 post in the department, and Rachel Brand, a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, will serve as the associate attorney general, the No. 3 post. The White House said Trump intends to nominate Steven Engel, a lawyer at the Dechert firm, as an assistant attorney general with reports suggesting he will run the Office of Legal Counsel.

Donald Trump's spats with U.S. allies as close as Mexico and as unlikely as Australia are leaving his new secretary of state and others in his Cabinet to clean up a lot of potential damage. It's a good-cop, bad-cop dynamic that could define America's foreign policy for the next four years. President Trump's first two weeks on the job have rattled foreign friends and foes alike — and even members of his own party — starting with his order to temporarily halt all refugee admissions as well as immigration from seven mainly-Muslim countries. Concern only escalated the past few days with his personal dust-ups with foreign leaders and declaration that Iran is now "on notice" for possible American action. "It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks," Trump said at a National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, as unseemly details circulated about his private phone calls with the Mexican and Australian leaders. "We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. It's not going to happen anymore." Trump's blunt comments came a day after word emerged of a tense discussion with Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull, in which the new U.S. president lambasted an Obama-era deal to resettle some 1,600 asylum-seekers. Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after blasting him for an agreement the U.S. made to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Diplomatic dysfunction was clear. Minutes after the U.S. Embassy in Canberra said the deal was still on, Trump seemed to contradict that message, tweeting: "I will study this dumb deal!" On the other side of the globe, new details emerged about strained ties between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. There was already irritation on both sides following Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's cancellation of a trip to Washington after Trump made the visit contingent on Mexico agreeing to pay for a U.S. border wall. In a follow-up phone call, Trump warned Pena Nieto that he was ready to send U.S. troops to stop "bad hombres down there" if Mexico's military can't control them, The Associated Press learned. The White House said the comments were made in a "lighthearted" manner. But administration officials described the calls with both leaders as contentious. Some top aides are underscoring Trump's emphasis on toughness and brawnier U.S. negotiations, dominant themes of his "America First" foreign policy. The Trump administration is preparing to levy sanctions on Iran after it test-fired a ballistic missile, according to U.S. officials and others with knowledge of the decision.

The sanctions are expected to be levied as early as Friday. Up to two dozen Iranian individuals, companies and possibly... At the United Nations, Trump's U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the U.S. would be "taking names" of countries that "don't have our back." His national security adviser, Michael Flynn, made a surprising appearance at the White House daily briefing to "officially" put Iran "on notice" after its ballistic missile test. Trump topped Flynn Thursday by saying "nothing is off the table" when it comes to a potential American response. But Trump's top diplomats are striking noticeably softer tones. Rex Tillerson, in his first day as secretary of state, implicitly acknowledged in an address to staff that many U.S. diplomats oppose some of Trump's positions. Without criticizing that, he called for unity. "Honesty will undergird our foreign policy, and we'll start by making it the basis of how we interact with each other," Tillerson said. "We are human beings first." The former Exxon Mobil CEO offered an olive branch to hundreds of diplomats who signed a "dissent cable" challenging Trump's order on immigration and refugees, affirming that "each of us is entitled to the expression of our political beliefs." While noting the nation's "hotly contested" election campaign, Tillerson stressed that "we cannot let out personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team."

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to project the same sentiment internationally in South Korea on Thursday, in his first official trip abroad. He said the president's message was "about the priority that we place on this alliance between our two nations," seeking to reassure an ally that was unnerved by Trump the candidate when he said it should take on greater self-defense responsibility. While Trump drives foreign policy from the White House, he appears to be tasking his top Cabinet officials with the responsibility of follow-up reassurance. They're also fielding questions from allies about his taboo-shattering language and trying to clarify the true U.S. positions behind the rhetoric. Though Tillerson himself lacks experience as a diplomat, he portrayed himself in his Senate confirmation hearing as a levelheaded tactician with foreign policy views within the Republican mainstream. He spent his first day at work meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. For many of Trump's supporters, each new antagonistic tweet, statement or executive order has been a fresh measure of proof that he intends to shake up a foreign policy establishment they reject and fulfill his promise to put "America first." They argue he is reasserting American strength after the weakness of the Obama administration. After winning the presidency, Trump quickly ruffled China, a chief American economic and political rival, with a call to the president of Taiwan, breaking longstanding U.S. policy. Trump's first meeting with a foreign leader, last week with British Prime Minister Theresa May, had been a bright spot in his diplomatic debut. But his immigration order brought thousands of protesters to London's streets labeling her "Theresa the Appeaser." Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson then called Trump's order "divisive, discriminatory and wrong." Trump's warnings to Iran prompted a more hostile response from Tehran on Thursday. "It is not for the first time that a naive person from the U.S. poses threats to Iran," said Ali-Akbar Velayati, foreign adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. According to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, Velayati said: "The U.S. will be the final loser." Meanwhile, it fell to Sen. John McCain, a hawkish Republican, to smooth relations with Australia. McCain said he phoned Australia's ambassador to affirm "unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance." Associated Press

It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief - a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America's staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead, President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday exchange. Then, 25 minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call, Trump abruptly ended it. At one point, Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day - including Russian President Vladimir Putin - and that "this was the worst call by far." Trump's behavior suggests that he is capable of subjecting world leaders, including close allies, to a version of the vitriol he frequently employs against political adversaries and news organizations in speeches and on Twitter. "This is the worst deal ever," Trump fumed as Turnbull attempted to confirm that the United States would honor its pledge to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Trump, who one day earlier had signed an executive order temporarily barring the admission of refugees, complained that he was "going to get killed" politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the "next Boston bombers." Trump returned to the topic late Wednesday night, writing in a message on Twitter: "Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!" U.S. officials said that Trump has behaved similarly in conversations with leaders of other countries, including Mexico. But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia - countries that share intelligence, support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The characterizations provide insight into Trump's temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation's chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. The depictions of Trump's calls are also at odds with sanitized White House accounts. The official readout of his conversation with Turnbull, for example, said that the two had "emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally." A White House spokesman declined to comment. A senior administration official acknowledged that the conversation with Turnbull had been hostile and charged, but emphasized that most of Trump's calls with foreign leaders - including the heads of Japan, Germany, France and Russia - have been productive and pleasant. Trump also vented anger and touted his political accomplishments in a tense conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, officials said. The two have sparred for months over Trump's vow to force Mexico to pay for construction of a border wall between the two countries, a conflict that prompted Peña Nieto to cancel a planned meeting with Trump. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Even in conversations marred by hostile exchanges, Trump manages to work in references to his election accomplishments. U.S. officials said that he used his calls with Turnbull and Peña Nieto to mention his election win or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. One official said that it may be Trump's way of "speaking about the mandate he has and why he has the backing for decisions he makes." But Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and even a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote. The friction with Turnbull reflected Trump's anger over being bound by an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world. The issue centers on a population of about 2,500 people who sought asylum in Australia but were diverted to facilities off that country's coast at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Deplorable conditions at those sites prompted intervention from the United Nations and a pledge from the United States to accept about half of those refugees, provided they passed U.S. security screening. Many of the refugees came from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, countries listed in Trump's order temporarily barring their citizens from entry to the United States. A special provision in the Trump order allows for exceptions to honor "a preexisting international agreement," a line that was inserted to cover the Australia deal. But U.S. officials said that Trump continued to fume about the arrangement even after signing the order in a ceremony at the Pentagon.

President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump's remarks came at the top of what was... "I don't want these people," Trump said. He repeatedly misstated the number of refugees called for in the agreement as 2,000 rather than 1,250, and told Turnbull that it was "my intention" to honor the agreement, a phrase designed to leave the U.S. president wiggle room to back out of the deal in the future, according to a senior U.S. official. Before Trump tweeted about the agreement Wednesday night, the U.S. Embassy in Canberra had assured Australian reporters that the new administration intended to take the refugees. "President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed," an embassy spokesman had told the reporters, according to an official in the Sydney consulate. "This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this embassy at 1315 Canberra time." The time the embassy said it was informed the deal was going ahead was 9:15 p.m. in Washington, one hour and 40 minutes before Trump suggested in a tweet that it might not go ahead. During the phone conversation Saturday, Turnbull told Trump that to honor the agreement, the United States would not have to accept all of the refugees but only to allow each through the normal vetting procedures. At that, Trump vowed to subject each refugee to "extreme vetting," the senior U.S. official said. Trump was also skeptical because he did not see a specific advantage the United States would gain by honoring the deal, officials said. Trump's position appears to reflect the transactional view he takes of relationships, even when it comes to diplomatic ties with long-standing allies. Australian troops have fought alongside U.S. forces for decades, and the country maintains close cooperation with Washington on trade and economic issues. Australia is seen as such a trusted ally that it is one of only four countries that the United States includes in the "Five Eyes" arrangement for cooperation on espionage matters. Members share extensively what their intelligence services gather and generally refrain from spying on one another. There also is a significant amount of tourism between the two countries. Trump made the call to Turnbull about 5 p.m. Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. At one point, Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues. But Trump demurred and ended the call, making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan, Angela Merkel of Germany, François Hollande of France or Putin. "These conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately," Turnbull said at a news conference Thursday in Australia. "If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them." A.

A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents show. Although Flynn lacked authorization to share the classified material, he was not disciplined or reprimanded after the investigation concluded that he did not act "knowingly" and that "there was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result," according to Army records obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act. Flynn has previously acknowledged that he was investigated while serving as the U.S. military intelligence chief in Afghanistan for sharing secrets with British and Australian allies there. But he has dismissed the case as insignificant and has given few details. The Army documents provide the first official account of the case, but they are limited in scope because the investigation itself remains classified. Former U.S. officials familiar with the matter said that Flynn was accused of telling allies about the activities of other agencies in Afghanistan, including the CIA. The Army files call into question Flynn's prior assertion that he had permission to share the sensitive information. The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... During the presidential race, Flynn campaigned vigorously for Republican nominee Donald Trump and drew attention for his scalding attacks against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified material. Clinton was investigated by the FBI for allowing classified information to be transmitted on her private email server when she ran the State Department. No charges were filed against the former secretary of state, but the issue dogged her for more than a year. At the Republican National Convention in July, Flynn called on Clinton to drop out of the race for putting "our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server." He egged on the partisan crowd in chants of "lock her up," adding: "If I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth, a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today." Flynn did not respond to requests for comment. The office of the Army's Judge Advocate General released a four-page summary of the investigation into Flynn in response to The Post's Freedom of Information Act request for records of any misconduct allegations involving the retired three-star general. The U.S. military opened the investigation into Flynn in 2010 after receiving a complaint from an unnamed Navy intelligence specialist, according to the documents. The intelligence officer charged that Flynn violated rules by "inappropriately" sharing secrets with "various foreign military officers and/or officials in Afghanistan." The documents do not reveal the nature of the information. But former U.S. officials familiar with the case said it centered on slides and other materials containing classified information about CIA operations in Afghanistan. "It was a general intelligence briefing that included stuff that shouldn't have been on those slides," said a former senior U.S. intelligence official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. The disclosures revealed "stuff the intelligence community was doing that had a much higher level of classification." The agency has had an extensive presence in Afghanistan since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Beyond gathering intelligence on al-Qaida and the Taliban, the CIA has also assembled its own paramilitary networks in the country, paying warlords for cooperation and funding armed groups known as Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams. A second former U.S. official said Flynn failed to secure permission to reveal those secrets. "This was a question of whether or not information was put through proper channels before it was shared," the second official said. The episode marked the second time in a year that Flynn had drawn official complaints for his handling of classified material. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. Former U.S. officials said that Flynn had disclosed sensitive information to Pakistan in late 2009 or early 2010 about secret U.S. intelligence capabilities being used to monitor the Haqqani network, an insurgent group accused of repeated attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Flynn exposed the capabilities during meetings with Pakistani officials in Islamabad. The former U.S. intelligence official said a CIA officer who accompanied Flynn reported the disclosures to CIA headquarters, which then relayed the complaint to the Defense Department. Flynn was verbally reprimanded by the Pentagon's top intelligence official at the time, James R. Clapper Jr. Clapper subsequently became director of national intelligence and endorsed Flynn to become his successor as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In 2014, however, Clapper forced Flynn out of that job over concerns with his temperament and management. The newly disclosed Army documents state that the 2010 investigation was ordered by the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Although the records do not say exactly when the case was opened, the commander at the time would have been Marine Gen. James Mattis. Mattis took charge at Central Command's headquarters in Tampa, Fla., in August 2010. One month later, Flynn was ordered back to Washington from Afghanistan. He was assigned to a temporary job at the Pentagon as the special assistant to the Army's chief of intelligence while the investigation unfolded, records show. A brief look at Republican Sen.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the bridge between Trump and the intelligence community. Mattis was nominated this month by Trump to serve as secretary of defense. In that role, Mattis will work closely with Flynn; the retired generals are expected to be the most influential voices on national security in the Trump administration. The Army documents that summarize the investigation into Flynn do not specify which countries he was accused of improperly sharing secrets with. In an interview with The Post in August, Flynn said he was scrutinized for giving classified information to British and Australian officials serving in Afghanistan alongside U.S. forces. In that interview, Flynn defended his actions and said he did nothing wrong. "That was substantiated because I actually did it. But I did it with the right permissions when you dig into that investigation. I'm proud of that one. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please." The Army documents, however, state explicitly that the Central Command investigation determined that Flynn did not have permission to share the particular secrets he divulged. The Defense Department's inspector general, which conducted an independent review of the investigation, came to the same conclusion, the documents show. It is routine for the U.S. military to share intelligence in Afghanistan with NATO allies such as Britain, as well as other members of the broader international coalition fighting the Taliban and al-Qaeda, including Australia. But there are established mechanisms and guidelines that must be followed. Flynn was highly regarded within the Army for the key role he played in shaping U.S. counterterrorism strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan. Pentagon officials had intended to promote Flynn in 2010 to the rank of lieutenant general and to make him assistant director of national intelligence, a job that would place him in charge of improving ties with foreign intelligence agencies. The Central Command investigation delayed his career advancement for a full year. He received his promotion and new assignment in September 2011. After being forced to retire from the military in 2014, Flynn became a vocal opponent of the Obama administration's policies regarding Iran and al-Qaeda. At the same time, he gained a reputation for floating conspiracy theories on Twitter. Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized his selection as Trump's national security adviser. The position is not subject to Senate confirmation.

The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn and his father, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn - Trump's designated national security adviser - have both used their social media accounts to promote fabricated claims, including allegations that aides to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were involved in a child prostitution ring. But the younger Flynn had renewed his support for the baseless allegation even after a North Carolina man armed with an assault rifle arrived at a pizzeria in Northwest Washington on Sunday to investigate the fictitious crime. The shooter, police said, fired at least two rounds at the restaurant before he was arrested. No one was hurt. "Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story," Flynn posted on Twitter just hours after the shooting, referring to a conspiracy theory circulated by right-wing groups that alleged - falsely - that the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant served as a front for child abuse by Democratic operatives. The tweet was the latest instance in which the Michael Flynn, 33, who has served as his father's chief of staff and scheduler, has propagated phony news stories and incendiary views. His dismissal appeared to mark the first time that the Trump transition team had held one of its insiders to account for such activity. The younger Flynn had a transition team email address but is believed to have had a limited role, serving mainly as an aide to his father. The son appeared to have shut down his Facebook, where he had also posted incendiary images and material. The older Flynn had also lent credence to phony claims that hacked Clinton emails contained code words for child exploitation. A veteran of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the elder Flynn has never disavowed that claim and is poised to be among the most influential advisers in Trump's White House.

The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn - national security adviser to then-President-elect Donald Trump - but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said. The calls were picked up as part of routine electronic surveillance of Russian officials and agents in the United States, which is one of the FBI's responsibilities, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss counterintelligence operations. Nonetheless, the fact that communications by a senior member of Trump's national security team have been under scrutiny points up the challenge facing the intelligence community as it continues its wide-ranging probe of Russian government influence in the U.S. election and whether there was any improper back-channel contacts between Moscow and Trump associates and acquaintances. Although Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were listened to, Flynn himself is not the active target of an investigation, U.S. officials said. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that U.S. counterintelligence agents had investigated the communications between Flynn and Kislyak. President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. have been in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday. After... President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. have been in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, a senior U.S. official said Friday. After... Of particular note was a Dec. 29 telephone conversation, initiated in an exchange of text messages the day before. Trump officials previously had said the call took place on the 28th. On the 29th, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia and expelled 35 officials from the Russian Embassy in response to what the U.S. intelligence community has said was interference in the presidential election on Trump's behalf. Earlier this month and on Monday, during his first official White House news conference, press secretary Sean Spicer said that the call covered several subjects. They included a Russian invitation to the Trump administration to take part in Russian-sponsored Syrian peace talks that began Monday in Kazakhstan. The men also talked about logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn also conveyed condolences for a Russian plane crash that killed a famed military band the day before the call, said Spicer, who said that Kislyak initiated the call after he and Flynn exchanged holiday greetings by text. Spicer also said Monday that the two had followed up with a subsequent call "two days ago ... three days ago" to further discuss a Trump-Putin call. In remarks when the Dec. 28 call was first reported this month, Spicer and other officials said there had been no mention of the sanctions that were announced the next day. On Monday, he said he was unaware of any other conversations between Flynn and members of the Russian government. Spicer said he asked Flynn if there had been conversations with any other Russian officials "beyond the ambassador. He said no." Earlier press reports had also cited a Flynn call to Kislyak on Dec. 19 to express condolences for the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Turkey that day.

Retired Lt. Gen. Michael... Although Flynn has written critically about Russia, he also was paid to deliver a speech at a 2015 Moscow gala for RT, the Kremlin-sponsored international television station, at which he was seated next to Putin. The FBI's counterintelligence agents listen to calls all the time that do not pertain to any open investigation, current and former law enforcement officials said. Often, said one former official, "they're just monitoring the other (foreign official) side of the call." Both Flynn, a former head of the Pentagon's intelligence agency, and Kislyak, a seasoned diplomat, are probably aware that Kislyak's phone calls and texts are being monitored, current and former officials said. That would make it highly unlikely, the individuals said, that the men would allow their calls to be conduits of illegal coordination.

U.S. counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said. But while it has been clear for months that a broad investigation is underway, what remains murky - even to lawmakers receiving closed briefings - is its scope and target. It is unclear if the intercepts being examined have any connection to the Trump campaign. But the investigation adds to the uncertainty surrounding Trump's relationship with Russia even as he is sworn in as U.S. president. U.S. intelligence agencies have already concluded that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump win. FBI Director James Comey has been chastised by Democratic lawmakers for refusing to even acknowledge that it was investigating alleged links between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been under FBI scrutiny for some time, including for allegations of illegal financial dealings in Ukraine, current and former U.S. officials said. Manafort has done business in Russia and Ukraine. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, CIA and the National Security Agency, which intercepts phone calls, emails and other electronic communications of foreigners overseas, are also involved in the probe, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is an ongoing matter. The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said. The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said. McClatchy and the New York Times first reported on details of the investigation. Manafort was forced out of the campaign in August in the wake of slipping poll numbers for Trump and news reports about his financial dealings with pro-Moscow leaders in Ukraine in which he is alleged to have received millions of dollars in secret cash payments. Manafort, a veteran GOP political operative, was hired last spring to work with Trump's campaign of political neophytes to be a voice of experience. But Manafort was not a typical Washington political hand. He was also a global deal-maker with ties to business and political leaders linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Manafort, in a response to the Times, said he had no contact with Russian officials and had not directed any others to have such contact. In congressional testimony, Comey has been cagey on whether there is an active investigation of Trump associates and their possible ties to Russia. His answers left the impression that a probe of some sort was underway, but his refusal to be more direct has frustrated Democrats who were outraged by Comey's comments late in the election on the FBI's probe of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked Comey whether the FBI has investigated "reported relationships" between "individuals associated with the Trump campaign" and "the Russians." Comey replied that he "would never comment on investigations, whether we have one or not in an open forum like this." Comey's position drew a derisive response from Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who said, "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid." The FBI chief then tried to qualify his answer, saying that "we sometimes think differently about closed investigations," referring to the Clinton probe, "but he asked me if I had any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that."

Pence also denied that Trump's incoming national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, spoke to Russian officials in December about sanctions that had been announced as retribution for Russian hacking in the election. "I talked to General Flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to new U.S. sanctions against Russia and the expulsion of diplomats," Pence said.

As the nation's top spies prepared to brief President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump on Russian interference in the 2016 election, they faced an excruciatingly delicate question: Should they mention the salacious allegations that had been circulating in Washington for months that Moscow had compromising information on the incoming president? Ultimately, they concluded they had no choice. A 35-page dossier packed with details of supposed compromising personal information, alleged financial entanglements and political intrigue was already in such wide circulation in Washington that every major news organization seemed to have a copy. "You'd be derelict if you didn't" mention the dossier, a U.S. official said. To ignore the file, produced by a private-sector security firm, would only make the supposed guardians of the nation's secrets seem uninformed, officials said, adding that many were convinced that it was only a matter of time before someone decided to publish the material. Their decision appears to have hastened that outcome, triggering coverage of politically charged allegations that news organizations had tried to run down for months but could find no basis for publishing until they were summarized and included alongside a highly classified report assembled by the nation's intelligence services. In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race.

Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... U.S. officials said Wednesday that the decision had been unanimous to attach the two-page summary of the dossier to a sweeping report on Russian election interference commissioned by the White House and briefed to Obama, Trump and congressional leaders. But U.S. intelligence officials appear to have been caught off-guard by the fallout, including a blistering attack by Trump, who accused spy agencies of engaging in Nazi-like tactics to smear him. In an effort to contain the damage, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday and "expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press." Clapper said in a statement issued late Wednesday that he told Trump that the allegations had come from a "private security company," that U.S. spy agencies had "not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable." "However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security," Clapper said. A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the nature of the summary "was fully explained" to Trump on Friday and "put into context." Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Chief James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers all concurred that both Obama and Trump should know that U.S. spy agencies were aware of the claims about compromising information on Trump and had investigated or explored them to some degree. During a rare press conference, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed reports on Russia's influence campaign, refused to release his tax returns and reiterated his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Jan. 11, 2017. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images | C-SPAN) U.S. officials emphasized that the summary was merely an annex to the main report, that the allegations it contained have never been substantiated and did not appear in the main body of the report or influence its conclusions that Russia sought to sabotage the 2016 race and help elect Trump. But linking a collection of unsubstantiated allegations to a classified report that is supposed to convey the intelligence community's firmest conclusions about Russian election interference has blurred the distinction between corroborated intelligence and innuendo. Former U.S. intelligence officials described the inclusion of the summary - drawn from "opposition research" done by a political research firm - as highly unusual. "It would be extraordinary if not unprecedented to bring to the attention of a president and president-elect a private document for which you had no reason to believe the allegations made in it," said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA and a Clinton supporter. Spokesmen for the CIA, FBI and the director of national intelligence declined to comment. The handling of the matter also seemed to deepen the level of distrust between Trump and the intelligence community, whose work he has repeatedly disparaged since his election victory two months ago.

President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him while comparing the tactic to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine trust between the next commander in chief... In a news conference in New York, Trump blasted U.S. intelligence agencies and accused them of employing Nazi-like tactics to discredit him. "I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake, out," Trump said, referring to a burst of headlines over the past two days about the dossier. "That's something that Nazi Germany would do and did do." The material in the dossier was assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, whose security and investigations firm was hired to assist a political research firm in Washington that was initially working for Trump's opponents in the Republican primaries but later offered its services to Democrats, according to individuals familiar with the matter. Steele's role was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. Since 2009, he and another former British intelligence officer have jointly operated a Britain-based firm called Orbis Business Intelligence. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The dossier was provided to multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post, which pursued numerous leads, including overseas, but could not substantiate its allegations. The document was also at some point delivered to the FBI. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., acknowledged in a public statement Wednesday that late last year he had "received sensitive information that has since been made public" and, unable to assess its accuracy, delivered the file to Comey. Other officials said that the FBI had obtained the dossier even before McCain's involvement and that U.S. officials had met with Steele, the former British spy, at least twice - once in August and again in mid-October, after Clapper had released a public statement accusing Russia of interfering in the election.

In the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Russia... Those meetings were part of a broader effort by the FBI and other agencies to evaluate the claims about Russia and compromising material on Trump. The dossier also included claims of ongoing, unexplained contacts between members of Trump's inner circle and allies of the Kremlin. The status of that inquiry is unclear. In Senate testimony Tuesday, Comey said that "we never confirm or deny a pending investigation." The line drew a reaction of disbelief from some lawmakers who have been sharply critical of Comey's decision during the election to discuss the bureau's probe of Hillary Clinton's email use. "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid," said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Although Comey was one of only four senior officials involved in the decision to include the two-page summary, some in Washington were quick to see that move as another political misstep by the FBI chief - calling arguably unnecessary attention to allegations against a major political figure. U.S. officials have offered conflicting accounts of what the meetings with Steele accomplished. A senior official said Tuesday that while the allegations in the two-page summary could not be corroborated, it was included in part because the sourcing was seen as reliable. Others disputed that and said that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate Steele's claims without getting detailed information about his sources in Russia, information he is seen as unlikely to be willing to share. A former senior U.S. intelligence official also questioned his ability to maneuver in Russia and gain access to high-level officials with ties to the Kremlin or Russian President Vladimir Putin. "How did this former British intelligence officer talk to all these Russian officials and not get arrested for espionage?" the former official asked. Steele's identity and association with his investigations firm are public, and are almost certainly known to Russian counterintelligence. "They would have been all over him," the former official said. "There are aspects of this [dossier] that are believable when you read it. There are other aspects that aren't." Some details would seem relatively easy for the FBI to assess, including meetings between close associates of Trump and Putin allies. But a senior law enforcement official acknowledged that other claims - including sweeping characterizations of relationships and rivalries inside the Kremlin - are more elusive. "This is not something we can validate or check out," the official said. "It's the view of people in Russia. It's not like we can go out and determine its veracity."

A striking change came over Moscow just hours after Donald Trump's surprise election: Suddenly, the Russian capital was a hotbed of zealous supporters of the U.S. electoral process. Throughout the campaign, Russia rooted for Trump as much as any other foreign country. According to the White House, Moscow also interfered as much as any other foreign country ever has in a U.S. election. But the Kremlin's commentators - convinced that Hillary Clinton was going to win - had also trashed the U.S. election as dirty, corrupt and unable to produce a legitimate result. Now that their man was in, and with Russian TV showing cheery Americans lining up to vote for Trump, they had to change their tune. "This is a great day for American democracy," gushed pro-Kremlin ideologue Sergei Markov at breakfast at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Moscow. "We have to respect American democracy." Public gloating aside, the long-term implications of a Trump presidency for the Kremlin are unclear. The two countries share years of bad blood and a basket of geopolitical grievances. A shortened list includes the conflict in Syria, the 2014 annexation of Crimea, U.S. economic sanctions and a military buildup on both sides of Russia's border with NATO. In just one night recently, NATO warplanes intercepted Russian jets 13 times. Is a change of presidents going to make all that go away? Despite Trump's promises to seek warmer relations, the warier commentators and officials in Moscow were skeptical. "They're drinking in the Kremlin now," said Alexei Venediktov, editor in chief of Echo of Moscow. But he predicted that the jubilation could soon fade. "We'll see what happens later." Wednesday's celebrations here didn't dwell on all that. Instead, there was glee over the rejection of a Hillary Clinton presidency that many Russians figured would bring more of the same: a torrent of American criticism that the pro-Kremlin crowd sees as "Russophobia." For them, America's election of Trump was cause for a rare lovefest. Russian President Vladimir Putin is giving a thumbs-up to president-elect Donald Trump's victory.

In a brief statement Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin has sent Trump a telegram to congratulate him on winning. Putin expressed "his hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from... "Today I want to ride around Moscow with an American flag in the window, if I can find a flag," tweeted Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of the Kremlin-owed RT news channel, a day after she tweeted "Democracy. R.I.P." in expectation of a Clinton win. Lawmakers at the Russian State Duma - an entirely loyal body dominated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, - burst into thunderous applause when they learned that democracy had been served overseas. "Tonight is a night of Trump for all Americans and the world," said Boris Chernyshev, a member of an ultranationalist faction at the Duma whose leader invited journalists for a champagne toast. Citing President Obama's 2008 slogan, he added, "Tonight we can use the slogan with Mr. Trump: Yes we did." As for the "we" part, Putin has repeatedly denied that Russia was interfering with the U.S. elections, although he has allowed that leaks of hacked Democratic Party emails benefited the public. (Markov, the unofficial Kremlin adviser, suggested Wednesday that Russia "may have helped" WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that published the emails, but he did not specify how he knew or what that meant.) Putin's denial didn't stop Russians from having fun with the idea that their leaders just might have swung the election of the leader of the free world. "It turns out that the United Russia has won the elections in the United States!" Russian media quoted Viktor Nazarov, governor of the Omsk region, as telling a meeting. "Judging by the hysterics in West, Vladimir Putin has won the U.S. elections," pro-Kremlin satirist Mikhail Zadornov said on Twitter, where the Russian-language hashtag "RussiachoosesTrump" was gaining traction. In a poll on the Echo of Moscow, the radio station asked its listeners, "Did Putin have a hand in Trump's victory?" While 60 percent answered no on Wednesday night, 32 percent, nearly 6,000 people, responded "yes." Putin, not surprisingly, made no mention of the interference allegations in his congratulatory words to Trump Wednesday, instead focusing on Trump's promising words during the campaign about restoring relations. "We understand that this will not be an easy path," Putin said. And he should know, because the laundry list of demands he made as conditions for restoring relations is daunting. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dispelled any notion that things would change right away, saying Putin had no plans to call Trump. In other former republics of the Soviet Union, particularly those in conflict with Russia like Ukraine and the Baltics, there were expressions of foreboding in contrast to Moscow's delight. Markov, the ideologue, said he doubted Trump would accede to all of Russia's demands - ending sanctions, compensating Moscow for the losses caused by them, recognizing the annexation of Crimea - but he did expect progress. He nevertheless worried about Trump's personal leadership style, gleaned from watching "The Apprentice" as well as the campaign. "He is macho. Putin also is macho," Markov said. "He said he wants to have good relations. But maybe they will clash." The Washington Post's Natalya Abbakumova contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump has long been effusive in his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, which will air ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday, Trump doubled down on his "respect" for Putin - even in the face of accusations that Putin and his associates have murdered journalists and dissidents in Russia. "I do respect him. Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'll get along with them," Trump told O'Reilly. O'Reilly pressed on, declaring to the president that "Putin is a killer." Unfazed, Trump didn't back away, but rather compared Putin's reputation for extrajudicial killings with the United States. "There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers," Trump said. "Well, you think our country is so innocent?" President Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration’s foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first official president-to-president contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

President Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration’s foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first official president-to-president contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. As his top aides looked on, Trump sat in the... Trump added that he thinks the United States is "better" getting along with Russia than not. "If Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all around the world, major fight. That's a good thing," Trump said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. It wouldn't be the first time Trump has brushed aside the topic of Putin's political killings. In a 2015 interview on "Morning Joe," Trump was pressed on the same issue and gave a similar answer. "He kills journalists that don't agree with him," the show's host, Joe Scarborough, pointed out. "Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe," Trump said. As recently as this week, a prominent Putin critic exhibited symptoms of poisoning for the second time since 2015. The incident drew the attention of Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), a staunch Russia critic, who tweeted two newspaper editorials that call for the United States to denounce the incident as an act of political retribution. He called both editorials "a must-read."

Even as confusion, internal dissent and widespread condemnation greeted President Trump’s travel ban and crackdown on refugees this weekend, senior White House aides say they are are only getting started. Trump and his aides justified Friday’s executive order, which blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days and halted refugees from around the world for 120, on security grounds — an issue that they say they take seriously. But their ultimate goal is far broader. Trump’s top advisors on immigration, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, see themselves as launching a radical experiment to fundamentally transform how the U.S. decides who is allowed into the country and to block a generation of people who, in their view, won’t assimilate into American society. That project may live or die in the next three months, as the Trump administration reviews whether and how to expand the visa ban and alter vetting procedures. White House aides are considering new, onerous security checks that could effectively limit travel into the U.S. by people from majority-Muslim countries to a trickle. The administration faced down another torrent of criticism Monday — from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, career diplomats, national security experts and world leaders — over the hasty rollout of the order, as well as the message it sent to both friends and adversaries in the war on terrorism. Though Trump’s ban does not affect all Muslims, as he promised during the campaign, many see it as religiously targeted. President Obama also weighed in for the first time, saying through a spokesman that he "is heartened" by the public demonstrations against it. Obama did not cite specific language from the order, but spokesman Kevin Lewis said Obama "fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion." The government bureaucracy also began a swift and startling level of resistance to the new president’s initiative, punctuated by a letter from acting U.S. Atty. Gen. Sally Yates, who declared that she would refuse to defend the order in court against a series of lawsuits. Trump immediately counterpunched, firing Yates within hours Monday night and replacing her with Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern district of Virginia, on an acting basis. A group of U.S. diplomats circulated an internal memo through a State Department process that allows them to privately express dissent, arguing that Trump’s order “runs counter to core American values of non-discrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants. "A policy which closes our doors to over 200-million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans ... will not achieve its aim of making our country safer," said a draft version of the memo.

The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican... The Pentagon, with written support from Republican military veterans serving in Congress, began compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the armed forces and is recommending that they be exempt from Trump’s temporary ban on entry to the U.S. by people from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. The move could potentially shield tens of thousands of Iraqi interpreters, advisors, and others who have assisted the U.S. military from the president’s controversial action. The list will include names of individuals who have “demonstrated their commitment” to helping the U.S., Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday. “Even people that are doing seemingly benign things in support of us — whether as a linguist, a driver, anything else — they often do that at great personal risk,” he said. “So people who take these risks are really making a tangible signal of support to the United States, and that’s something that will, and should be, recognized." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration recognizes the help of Iraqi interpreters and others who have served this country, but added that they would remain subject to intense vetting. “We should make sure that in those cases they're helped out,” he said. “But that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass.” Despite the backlash, senior White House officials maintain that the ban is popular with Trump’s voters, though no reputable polling on the question has been released since Friday’s order. Spicer said media coverage of the implementation had been overblown, given that only 109 of 325,000 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours. He said Trump is putting in place proactive security measures rather than reacting to attacks. “I'm sorry that some folks may have had to wait a little while, but I think the president would much rather know that he's not placing a call to someone who was killed because someone was let into this country to commit a terrorist act,” he said. Still, the countries of origin for perpetrators of several prominent attacks cited by Spicer were not on the list of banned countries. Spicer and other administration officials said more countries could be added. Spicer had little sympathy for dissenting diplomats, saying their disagreement with the policy calls “into question whether or not they should continue in that post or not.” On Jan. 18, President Barack Obama told reporters in his final news conference that he would comment on his successor's actions only at "certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake." He managed to stay quiet for less than two weeks. Obama, who is still on vacation with his family...

He managed to stay quiet for less than two weeks. Obama, who is still on vacation with his family... Yet they were hardly the only ones voicing concern. Phone lines throughout the Capitol were jammed with constituents asking questions and raising concerns over the order. White House aides fought back against characterizations that they had kept the order to themselves, pointing to input they had gotten for months from allies. Senior GOP staff on the House and Senate judiciary committees helped write a version of the executive order on their own time during Trump’s transition. They based its legal wording on the harsh immigration policy Trump laid out on the campaign trail. During a speech in Phoenix in August, Trump promised to suspend immigration from “places like Syria and Libya” and create an “ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.” But several stakeholders said they were left out. One Republican senator who contacted the White House on Sunday seeking guidance failed to get full clarification, according to an aide. Two GOP aides complained that Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the Homeland Security committee, had “absolutely no role” in drafting Trump’s final order. They said that a memo McCaul drafted with former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a longtime Trump supporter, and others focused largely on explaining “why the Muslim ban was a terrible idea." The aides disputed that Trump’s order amounted to a Muslim ban, noting that Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world, was not on it. "It’s self-evident that the coordination of this executive order was bungled, that that has had consequences, and we hope that in the future the White House will more proactively engage congress and the agencies that are effected,” said one of Republican leadership aides, granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The chief architects of Trump’s order, Bannon, Miller and National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, forged strong bonds during the presidential campaign. A chorus that began in Silicon Valley is gaining voices across corporate America, as more business leaders from other industries speak out against President Donald Trump's travel ban prohibiting entry of migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries or touted their commitments to diversity. A chorus that began in Silicon Valley is gaining voices across corporate America, as more business leaders from other industries speak out against President Donald Trump's travel ban prohibiting entry of migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries or touted their commitments to diversity. The trio, who make up part of Trump’s inner circle, have a dark view of refugee and immigration flows from majority-Muslim countries, believing that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate disaffected and disenfranchised immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years. Within decades, Americans would have “the kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multidimensional and multigenerational and becomes sort of a permanent feature,” one senior administration official argued. “We don’t want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it’s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,” the official said. Counter-terrorism experts have long noted that Muslim immigrants in the U.S. are better assimilated and less likely to be radicalized than immigrants in many European cities. But the connection between immigration, security, economics and culture that defines the nationalist ideology of Bannon and Miller has become intertwined in Trump’s own rhetoric. “Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,” Trump tweeted over the weekend. “Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world — a horrible mess!” Times staff writers Lisa Mascaro, Michael A.

The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican bonhomie, Trump and his aides kept GOP congressional leaders almost completely in the dark about the most consequential act of his young presidency: a temporary ban on refugees and on anyone from seven majority-Muslim nations. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them. Inside the West Wing, tensions flickered as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by chief strategist Stephen Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of chief of staff Reince Priebus and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command. Miller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move in television interviews. As it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump's orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public. "The problem they've got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump. In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... The infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller. "This weekend was a disgrace and it's all on your shoulders," Scarborough intoned. His commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., recently appeared, he received a congratulatory call from Trump just moments later. Scarborough's monologue encapsulated many of the hallmarks of the new White House: It was direct, passionate and provocative, and it played out on live television. Scarborough's analysis aligned with a faction of the West Wing that has grown concerned about the ascent of Miller and Bannon, close partners in driving Trump to make good on his most populist and nationalistic campaign promises, however incendiary. One area of heated debate is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal protection to undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children - commonly known as "dreamers." Hardline conservatives have been urging Trump to rescind DACA, while other advisers, including Gingrich, are counseling him to keep it in place and avoid a politically treacherous confrontation, according to people involved in the deliberations. "Why pick a fight over this group of people who have a lot of emotional stories to tell? It's not realistic. It's not practical," Gingrich said. "I strongly agree with the general direction we're going, but I think this particular fight doesn't emotionally make any sense." In many ways, Trump's leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials - Bannon and Miller chief among them - are actively shaping policy and guiding the president's decisions. Others - such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer - function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions. The Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus's wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception. Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing... Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing... The competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues' motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. "A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing," one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. "We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he's seeing shadows where there are no shadows." During the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions. But Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House. White House officials reject the notion that chaos has overshadowed the early days of Trump's presidency. They say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order. "While false narratives circulate, the White House staff is busy working, together, to implement President Trump's agenda for the betterment of our country," said a White House spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record. Trump fired off angry tweets attacking the media and lawmakers who criticized his ban, from mocking Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for his "tears" to labeling Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., "sadly weak." Privately, the president seethed, venting about what he saw as unfair news coverage on a second straight weekend of mass protests, and quizzing confidants about their impressions of how his senior staffers were performing. As the controversy swirled, Trump, who has taken to giving visitors mini-tours of his new residence, found comfort in a trio of loyalists who share a room just steps from the Oval Office - Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman who has been at Trump's side since before his campaign launch; Johnny McEntee, a former college football quarterback who is now the president's personal aide; and Keith Schiller, a retired New York police officer and head of Trump's personal security detail who now directs Oval Office operations. Nonetheless, some of Trump's friends as well as his critics fear that his agenda may be compromised by mismanagement. "Frankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff," said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump's primary rivals. "If I were the president, I'd be very upset with the staff - that they didn't say, 'Hey, wait, hold on a second.' Because that's what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, 'Hey, your message is fine but here is what's going to come from it.' " On Capitol Hill, many Republicans close to leadership were frustrated that they received little to no guidance, or advance notice, about Trump's immigration and refugee directive. One top House office said it was able to glean the president's plan only through unofficial back channels to the Department of Homeland Security. Asked if he was consulted in drafting the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., replied simply, "I wasn't" - an echo of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who told reporters Monday that the White House had not briefed him before signing the order. The first substantive guidance to congressional Republicans came late Saturday - well after protesters had descended on the nation's airports - in a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy but, to the chagrin of several Capitol Hill aides, very little political guidance. At the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on "victims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals." Washington state's attorney general declared Monday that he was suing President Donald Trump over his temporary ban on immigration from seven countries with majority-Muslim populations, making it the first state to announce a legal action against the Trump administration over one of its policies. Washington state's attorney general declared Monday that he was suing President Donald Trump over his temporary ban on immigration from seven countries with majority-Muslim populations, making it the first state to announce a legal action against the Trump administration over one of its policies. It was not only Trump's immigration order that rankled official Washington. His presidential memorandum that restructured the National Security Council to elevate Bannon to a seat on the Principals Committee, alongside the secretaries of state and defense, worried many in the national security community. Also concerning was language suggesting that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could only attend certain Principals Committee meetings. But Spicer told reporters Monday that Trump was revising the directive to also include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he insisted that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chairman would be included in any Principals Committee meeting they wish to attend. The confusion out of the White House about the president's intentions left some of the government's most decorated officials scrambling to assert their relevance. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, took the unusual step of issuing a statement to emphasize that he will "fully participate" in giving the president military advice. "I remain honored and humbled to represent the extraordinary men and women of the Joint Force in serving the president and our nation," Dunford wrote.

As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who deliberate on the country’s most pressing — and often secret — national security issues. Trump named one of his senior political counselors, Steve Bannon, to a seat on the council’s principals committee. The president also limited the attendance of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence to an as-needed basis at the panel’s meetings. “Stone-cold crazy,” tweeted Susan Rice, former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, sarcastically asking, “Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?” using acronyms for Islamic State and North Korea. Another top Trump aide, Stephen Miller, effectively ran the National Security Council principals meeting Saturday, according to two Trump administration officials, a highly unusual move. Miller was a major architect of the refugee and visa ban. The guiding hands of Bannon and Miller — "my two Steves," as Trump has affectionately called them — who are only occasionally heard from publicly but almost constantly seen alongside Trump, were evident in much of the developments at the White House in Trump’s first week. White House officials defended President Donald Trump's move to give top political strategist Stephen Bannon a permanent spot on the National Security Council while limiting the role of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We are instilling reforms... White House officials defended President Donald Trump's move to give top political strategist Stephen Bannon a permanent spot on the National Security Council while limiting the role of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We are instilling reforms... Bannon, the former head of the far-right website Breitbart News, once said his goal was to “bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” Trump made clear through a series of acts in his first week that he intends to upend government policy, not only on reassessing the refugee program but directives to build a wall along the border with Mexico and changes on environmental, healthcare and other issues. Miller, who developed detailed knowledge of the nation's immigration laws while working on the staff of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, spent much of Saturday making policy decisions based on a strict interpretation of the immigration order and instructing senior Homeland Security officials on how to implement the plan. Trump’s orders for stopping travelers from seven countries, blocking Syrian refugees and banning all refugee admissions for 120 days were pushed through at breakneck pace instead of what is usually a careful process of review by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies for major changes to immigration policy. Instead, Homeland Security officials were given little time to review the order before it was made public. On one of the order’s most controversial and confusing parts, the status of permanent residents, Bannon and Miller at one point overruled an interpretation by Homeland Security officials in favor of a more limited policy that blocked green card holders until they apply for a waiver from the ban, the officials said. President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... After a weekend of conflicting instructions to border officials at airports, the administration said late Sunday that green card holders would not be affected by Trump’s order. About 170 permanent residents from the banned countries had applied for waivers to enter by Sunday afternoon, and all had been granted, a senior administration official said. After chaotic scenes at airport terminals across the country and multiple court orders limiting Trump’s directives, the White House defended the rollout of the policy. The implementation was done “seamlessly” and with “extraordinary professionalism,” a senior administration official told reporters Sunday, adding that the court orders had not undermined the policy’s “substance” or “purpose.” Trump’s top spokesman, Sean Spicer, also defended Trump’s decision to expand Bannon’s reach, telling ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday that Trump is simply trying to “streamline” decision-making and cut bureaucracy. “He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,” Spicer said of Bannon, noting that he is a former naval officer and adding that it’s only right for the president’s top strategist to “come in and talk about what the strategy is going forward.” Bannon’s and Miller’s increasing power potentially portends a new era of political calculus being applied to decisions on how to deploy American spies and soldiers overseas. Former President George W. Bush kept his powerful strategist Karl Rove out of the Situation Room, where National Security Council meetings are usually held, Joshua Bolten, a White House chief of staff under Bush, said at a conference in September at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Texas. “The signal he wanted to send to the rest of his administration, the signal he wanted to send to the public, and the signal he especially wanted to send to the military is that the decisions I'm making that involve life and death for the people in uniform will not be tainted by any political decisions,” Bolten said of Bush. The point was echoed by David Rothkopf, the CEO of Foreign Policy magazine’s parent company and an international relations expert. “The idea that a purely political adviser should be at the table while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence are not shows a profound lack of understanding of what the NSC has been — or what it should be,” he wrote. Robert Gates, Defense secretary under both Bush and Obama, said that while he was not bothered by the addition of Bannon to the National Security Council, he was troubled by the removal of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence, except when their issues are being discussed, calling the move a “big mistake.” “They both bring a perspective and judgment and experience to bear that every president, whether they like it or not, finds useful,” Gates said on “This Week.” National security experts and even some Republican lawmakers believe that Trump’s executive orders, which don’t target citizens who have been involved in attacks against the U.S., are more likely to inflame resentment against the U.S. than to make the country more secure.

The confusion over who was allowed in and who was sent back out of the country made clear the executive order “was not properly vetted,” Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement, adding that they feared retaliation from extremists. The large majority of terrorism-related arrests on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11 attacks have been U.S. citizens or legal residents, not foreign travelers, according to a study by the New America Foundation that was released last year. “Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents,” the study’s authors wrote. “In addition, about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration.” Former New York mayor Rudolph W.

House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage. The tweaks addressed numerous GOP concerns about the legislation, ranging from the flexibility it would give states to administer their Medicaid programs to the amount of aid it would offer older Americans to buy insurance. They are the product of two weeks of negotiations that stretched from the Capitol to the White House to President Donald Trump's Florida resort. The bill's proponents also appeared to overcome a major obstacle Monday after a key group of hard-line conservatives declined to take a formal position against the bill, known as the American Health Care Act. The House Freedom Caucus has threatened for weeks to tank the legislation drafted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., arguing that it does not do enough to undo the seven-year-old Affordable Care Act. Their neutrality gives the legislation a better chance of passage: If the group of about three dozen hard-right GOP members uniformly opposed the bill, it could block its passage. Their decision not to act as a bloc frees House leaders and White House officials to persuade individual Freedom Caucus members to support the measure — a process that the Freedom Caucus's chairman said was underway. "They're already whipping with a whip that's about 10 feet long and five feet wide," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. "I'm trying to let my members vote the way that their constituents would want them to vote. ... I think they're all very aware of the political advantages and disadvantages." President Donald Trump is deploying an outside and inside strategy to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, seeking support beyond Washington before making an in-person pitch on Capitol Hill.

President Donald Trump is deploying an outside and inside strategy to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, seeking support beyond Washington before making an in-person pitch on Capitol Hill. Trump rallied supporters Monday night in Louisville, Ky., alongside Senate Majority... House leaders hope to pass the bill Thursday and then send it to the Senate. Trump is expected to press for the bill's passage in a Tuesday morning meeting with Republican lawmakers. Some of the changes unveiled Monday were made to placate conservatives, such as accelerating the expiration of the ACA's taxes and further restricting the federal Medicaid program. But a major push was made to win moderate votes, including a maneuver that House leaders said would allow the Senate to beef up tax credits for older Americans who could see major increases in premiums under the GOP plan. There were signs Monday that the bill had growing support among the moderate wing of the House GOP. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who had voted against the leadership in an early procedural vote on the health-care legislation, said that he was "satisfied enough that I will support the bill." It's a rough week to be Paul Ryan. Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass. Now, the party has given itself just a few days to come up with a bill the party can... It's a rough week to be Paul Ryan. Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass. Now, the party has given itself just a few days to come up with a bill the party can... MacArthur said he was assured that the bill would do more for older and disabled Americans covered under Medicaid and that an additional $85 billion in aid would be directed to those between ages 50 and 65. "That's a $150 billion change in this bill to help the poor and those who are up in years," he said. Several House Republicans from Upstate New York won an amendment that would allow counties in their state to keep hundreds of millions of dollars of local tax revenue that they forward to the state government to fund its Medicaid program. One member, Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., told the Syracuse Post-Standard on Monday that her support of the bill was conditioned on the amendment's inclusion. Opponents of the bill - Republicans and Democrats alike - called the deal a sordid giveaway on social media networks Monday night. Many compared it to the state-specific deals that were cut to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 and panned by Republicans - such as the Medicaid reimbursement boost that then-Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., secured for his home state that Republicans mocked as the "Cornhusker Kickback." The Freedom Caucus had pushed for a variety of alterations, from an earlier phaseout of the ACA's Medicaid expansion to a more thorough rollback of the insurance mandates established under the law. But for political and procedural reasons, few of the group's major demands stand to be incorporated into the bill. "It's very clear that the negotiations are over," said Meadows, who met with White House officials at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday. Many Freedom Caucus members who left the group's Capitol Hill meeting Monday night said they remained sharply opposed to the legislation. "Nothing's changed," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a co-founder of the caucus. "We've still got lots of problems with this bill. ... The president's a good man, and the White House has been great to work with, but opposition is still strong with our group." Under the group's rules, it can take a formal position to oppose the bill if 80 percent of its members agree. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, meaning Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than 21 of their own members. Meadows said after Monday night's meeting that taking a hard position against the bill "creates some dynamics within the group that perhaps we don't want to create," hinting at tensions in the group's ranks. One of its members, Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., decided to support the bill last week when he met with Trump in the Oval Office, emboldening House leaders who think that even hard-liners will be hard-pressed to oppose Trump. "This is a defining moment for our nation, but it's also a defining moment for the Freedom Caucus," Meadows said. "There are core things within this bill as it currently stands that would violate some of the principles of the Freedom Caucus." Attending the Freedom Caucus meeting Monday were three senators opposed to the House bill - Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., - who hold leverage to block the bill in their own chamber, where Republicans hold a two-seat majority. Cruz said he told the House members that the leadership strategy of pursuing distinct "phases" of legislation was a dead end and that they needed to push for changes in the present bill. "The Senate Democrats are engaging in absolute opposition and obstruction, and it is difficult to see that changing anytime soon," Cruz told reporters after leaving the meeting. Trump's visit to the Hill on Tuesday signals that GOP leaders and the president consider larger-scale talks with key blocs of House members to be essentially complete. The effort now turns toward persuading individual members to vote for the package. Ryan credited Trump's backing in a statement Monday: "With the president's leadership and support for this historic legislation, we are now one step closer to keeping our promise to the American people and ending the Obamacare nightmare." Trump's visit Tuesday will be his first appearance at the weekly House Republican Conference meeting since becoming president. He last privately addressed Republican lawmakers as a group at the party's policy retreat in Philadelphia in late January and has met with small groups of members on several occasions since. Trump won the backing of Palmer and several other conservative House members Friday when he agreed to make changes to the Medicaid portion of the bill, including giving states the option of instituting a work requirement for childless, able-bodied adults who receive the benefit. Those changes were included in the leadership-backed amendments that will be incorporated into the bill before it comes to a final vote. To address concerns expressed by a broader swath of GOP lawmakers — conservatives and moderates alike — leaders said they hoped to change the bill to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance. In an extreme case laid out in a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 a year would see yearly premiums rise from $1,700 under the ACA to $14,600 under the Republican plan. House leaders said they intended to provide another $85 billion of aid to those between ages 50 and 64, but the amendment unveiled late Monday did not do so directly. Instead, the leaders said, it "provides the Senate flexibility to potentially enhance the tax credit" for the older cohort by adjusting an unrelated tax deduction. That workaround, aides said, was done to ensure that the House bill would comply with Senate budget rules and to ensure that the CBO could release an updated analysis of the legislation before the Thursday vote. But it also means that the House members who pushed for the new aid will have to trust the Senate to carry out their wishes. The Washington Post's Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.

President Trump spent Tuesday selling the Republican health-care overhaul to skeptical House members, warning his party that failure would endanger his legislative agenda and their own political careers. But more than two dozen GOP lawmakers remained firmly opposed to the legislation amid the high-stakes persuasion campaign led by Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) - more than enough to block the bill ahead of a planned Thursday vote. House passage would represent a powerful, if symbolic, achievement for both men - and failure would send leaders back to the drawing board on a key issue that Trump and congressional Republicans promised voters they would address. Even if the House approves the package, the legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate. The holdouts are mainly hard-line conservatives who believe the bill, known as the American Health Care Act, does not do nearly enough to undo the Affordable Care Act passed by Democrats in 2010. But they also include moderates who fear the bill will imperil their constituents as well as their party's prospects at the ballot box. In a morning address to a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, Trump used both charm and admonishment as he made his case, reassuring skittish members that they would gain seats in Congress if the bill passed. He singled out Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, which has led the right-wing opposition to the bill. "I'm gonna come after you, but I know I won't have to, because I know you'll vote yes," Trump said, according to several lawmakers who attended the meeting. "Honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks." House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage.

House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage. The tweaks addressed numerous GOP concerns about the legislation, ranging from... Trump's remarks - which Meadows said he took as good-natured ribbing - reflected his mounting urgency to secure a major legislative victory in the early months of his presidency and fulfill a central campaign promise by repealing the signature domestic achievement of President Barack Obama. Passing a health-care measure is key to unlocking momentum for the president's other legislative priorities such as tax reform and infrastructure spending. "He wants to get this bill done," said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Trump ally. "I don't hear that as a threat. It's a statement of reality." In interviews, more than two dozen lawmakers said they were either firmly opposed to the bill or leaning toward voting against it. Ryan can lose only 21 members of his own party for the bill to succeed, as no Democrats have pledged to support the package. Several Republicans privately said Tuesday that the Thursday vote could be postponed if leaders are unable to secure enough firm votes for passage beforehand. One top Republican not authorized to speak about the whipping process said the leadership remained confident it will collect enough support but is weighing scheduling options. "The White House is engaged, the leadership is engaged, everyone is working together," the Republican said. "But this is the House GOP, and you can't assume that it's going to go perfect. You leave options," meaning a vote on Friday or even the weekend. A second Republican, also not authorized to discuss internal deliberations, said others in the leadership orbit were eager to bring the bill to the floor even if the count is narrow because they would like opponents to take ownership of their position and the consequences of what it would mean for the president. Addressing reporters Tuesday, Ryan played down the possibility that the bill could fail Thursday and argued that conservatives should be pleased that many of their demands would probably be in the legislation. Adding further changes, he said, could jeopardize the legislation's chances in the Senate. It's a rough week to be Paul Ryan. Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass.

Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass. Now, the party has given itself just a few days to come up with a bill the party can... "If you get 85 percent of what you want, that's pretty darn good," he said. "We don't want to put something in this bill that the Senate is telling us is fatal." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sounded a cautiously optimistic note Tuesday, promising that the Senate would forge ahead with plans for votes on the measure - if it passed the House first. "If the House passes something, I will bring it up," McConnell said. "We'll try to move it across the floor next week." On Tuesday afternoon, Trump hosted more than a dozen members of the Tuesday Group, a moderate House faction, in the Oval Office for a lower-key lobbying session that involved Trump asking each person to relay their concerns about the bill. On Friday, a similar meeting helped Trump win converts among members of the Republican Study Committee, a key conservative bloc. But on Tuesday, Trump found more resistance. Going into the White House meeting, Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) described himself as "a strong lean no," citing a variety of concerns. "My views are based on fundamentals in the legislation," he said. "I don't see the lower premiums in this bill." After the meeting, he said his views had hardened: "I'm a no," he told reporters. The meeting came less than 24 hours after GOP leaders released changes to the bill that they believe are sufficient to win a House majority. Many of the changes were made to placate conservatives, including giving states the option to take a fixed Medicaid block grant and to impose work requirements on childless, able-bodied adults covered under the program. Others responded to broader concerns about the sufficiency of the tax credits offered to help Americans purchase insurance. One revision was more narrowly targeted - added at the behest of a group of Upstate New York Republicans who wanted to end their state's practice of commandeering local tax revenue to fund state Medicaid benefits. That compounded the concerns of Rep. Daniel Donovan (R-N.Y.), a Tuesday Group member who represents parts of New York City that would be hurt by the change. "I have four hospital systems in my district; they are my biggest employers," he said. "All of them have grave concerns about how they are going to survive if this gets passed." After the White House session, Donovan said he welcomed the meeting with Trump but had not reached a final decision: "We'll know on Thursday. Some of these things have to be addressed." One surprising holdout was Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), who was among the first House members to endorse Trump and has emerged as one of his most stalwart backers. But he is a hard-liner on illegal immigration and cited the issue Tuesday in opposing the bill. The tax credits offered under the GOP plan, he said, could be claimed by an individual who is not "lawfully in this country and eligible to receive them." "I would have a hard time explaining to families in the 11th District . . . why they should be helping to pay for the health expenses of someone who broke the law to get here and has no right to those federal dollars," he said. But it was Trump's warning to Meadows that sent the sharpest message Tuesday. "He was kidding around - I think," said Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), a bill supporter. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said later in the day: "Mark Meadows is a longtime, early supporter of the president. He had some fun at his expense this morning during the conference meeting." Asked whether Trump believed that Republicans who opposed the bill would be damaged at the ballot box, Spicer answered: "I think they'll probably pay a price at home." Spicer explained that statement was not a threat but "a political reality." Meadows told reporters that he had a "sincere and deep friendship" with Trump and appreciated the many hours of negotiation that were involved in the package. But he remained firmly against the bill absent major changes that Trump and Ryan have now ruled out. "This is not a personality decision; this is a policy decision," Meadows said. "It won't lower premiums, and until it does, I'm going to be a no, even if I sends me home." The Freedom Caucus has not taken a formal position to oppose the bill, but it appeared on Tuesday that the bulk of the caucus's roughly three dozen members stood ready to vote it down. Two caucus members who said they could support the bill - Reps. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) - both serve on the committees that wrote it. The others insisted the Freedom Caucus would hold fast. "I personally know of more than 21 House members who are pretty strong no's," said Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa). "So when [GOP leaders] say they've got the numbers, they don't have the numbers." Blum said he was not concerned by Trump's implied threat that he could face an electoral challenge next year if he opposed the bill: Trump won his northeastern Iowa district by three points, but Blum won it by eight points. "I outperformed the president, so I'm not worried about that," he said. "They know who I am, and they know that I care about them, and they know I'll stand up to my own leadership. I'll stand up to the president of the United States, I'll stand up for what I think is right." The Washington Post' s David Nakamura, Juliet Eilperin and David Weigel contributed to this report.

When bioethicist and oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, the session revealed publicly what has been happening privately for months: A trusted ally of former President Barack Obama and chief architect of the Affordable Care Act is trying to help steer how Republicans take it apart. With the administration and GOP leaders in Congress working to rewrite the landmark 2010 law - and Democrats displaying little appetite for negotiating with them - Emanuel appears to be one of the only members of his party with a seat at the table. Monday's meeting was Emanuel's third in-person conversation on health policy with Trump since the November election. According to one person familiar with the session, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private discussion, it took place in the Oval Office and lasted about 40 minutes. Among the others also attending were Vice President Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and the White House National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn. Details of the conversation were not immediately available. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed the meeting took place - only days before Ryan hopes to bring the bill to a House vote. "Obviously, [Emanuel] and the president have some differing views on the best way to make health care affordable and accessible," Spicer told reporters afterwards. "But the president also strongly believes that the health and well-being of the American people shouldn't always be a partisan issue," he said, noting that Trump also has talked about drug prices with Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. In an interview on Sunday, Emanuel recalled how during the ACA's drafting, Democrats held ongoing discussions with shifting groups of Republican lawmakers, even though no GOP members of the House or Senate ultimately supported the legislation. The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... Now, however, such bipartisan discussion of the future of federal health-care law "doesn't seem to be happening," said Emanuel, who chairs the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy. "I may be the only person on the Democratic side who, for crazy reasons, they've agreed to talk to." This role is a dramatic turnabout for the prolific health policy expert who served as a top adviser in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011 and was demonized at the time by many Republicans. In his 2014 book Reinventing American Health Care, Emanuel wrote that "beginning in 2020 or so, the ACA will increasingly be seen as a world historical achievement, even more important for the United States than Social Security and Medicare has been. And Barack Obama will be viewed more like Harry Truman - judged with increasing respect over time." While Emanuel is partisan, he also is pragmatic, and he has consistently maintained that the sprawling law needs improvement. He has argued that it should be altered to further expand insurance coverage, contain health costs, improve the health plans' affordability, and address the inconsistent caliber of health-care delivery in the United States. Ezekiel Emanuel, the older brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a key figure in health policy circles, came under fire from fellow doctors this week for declaring in a magazine article that he wants to die at the age of 75.

Ezekiel Emanuel, the older brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a key figure in health policy circles, came under fire from fellow doctors this week for declaring in a magazine article that he wants to die at the age of 75. In the article, which appeared in the October issue of The Atlantic... Following the election, the president-elect phoned Emanuel and said they would meet in January after the inauguration. Emanuel replied that they needed to talk sooner, because, if Congress repealed and replaced the ACA, it would "tank" Trump's presidency, Emanuel recalled. In mid-December, officials for the presidential transition announced that Emanuel would visit Trump at Trump Tower. Then last month, he met with the president at the White House. Along the way, he also has discussed health-care matters periodically with several of Trump's top advisers. "I take the president seriously when he says he wants to get everyone in the country covered," Emanuel said Sunday - a goal that could be an even bigger challenge under the Republians' American Health Care Act. A forecast last week by the Congessional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would lead to 24 million more uninsured Americans by 2026. In 2018 alone, the CBO projected, the number of people without health coverage could increase by 14 million. "There are ideas out there that are bipartisan, and I'm pushing those ideas," Emanuel said. They include the idea of automatically enrolling Americans in coverage with a minimum set of benefits. "It's not administratively simple, but it's got appeal." The conversations between the two men carry political risks for both sides. Emanuel's brother, Rahm, is the mayor of Chicago and a one-time Obama chief of staff who has clashed repeatedly with Trump over how best to address gun violence in that city. And the doctor has himself come under Republican fire before. Former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin once called him "Orwellian" for an op-ed in which he noted that many medical professionals support the idea of providing care to younger rather than older patients when resources are very scarce. Emanuel, who opposes physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, countered that critics had taken a single piece of his voluminous works of writing out of context. He has been an outspoken critic of the U.S. health-care system; his 2014 book's full title continues as "How the Affordable Care Act Will Improve Our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System." Under the ACA, he helped usher in changes to how health care is delivered, from accelerating the adoption of electronic medical records to making preventative health services more affordable. As a tenured professor who does not hold elected office, Emanuel has considerably more freedom than many other prominent Democrats. Even as he talks with the White House, he rejects the current House GOP legislation. It would leave many Americans without insurance who are currently covered without insurance, he said Sunday, and it fails to address the factors driving up health care costs. "In its present form, the bill is totally unacceptable to Democrats, myself included," he said. But Emanuel is accustomed to intellectual combat. In another of his books, he recounted what it was like to grow up with his equally ambitious and accomplished brothers (the other one, Ari, is a prominent Hollywood agent), who helped turn family dinners into verbal sparring matches. The bitter fight over the origins of the ACA taught him the danger of declaring victory - or defeat - too early, he says: "One thing you recognize is, it's not over til it's over."

Vice President Mike Pence was in full charm mode Saturday when he touched down here for a visit to try to sell the Republican health-care plan in a state that has a complex relationship with former president Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Just a day earlier, Kentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin had told reporters that while he is eager to overhaul Obama's health plan, he found himself skeptical of the initial Republican proposal and more in line with the views of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has been an outspoken opponent of the bill. Paul, Bevin said, "is not impressed with what has currently been offered. Truth be told, I'm not, either. So I'm with him." And so, Pence got to work just moments after Air Force Two stopped taxiing. Bevin greeted the vice president at the airport with two of his young sons and one of the their friends, and Pence quickly invited them back onboard the plane for a behind-the-scenes peek. A Republican proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Donald Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with several conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to... A Republican proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Donald Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with several conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to... Then, at a roundtable before his speech, Pence touted Bevin's business background and invited the group to applaud him, before quipping, "I was for Matt Bevin before it was cool" - a line he later repeated during his official remarks. During his speech, the vice president again singled out the governor for praise - as well as ribbing him about their states' college basketball rivalry (Pence is from Indiana). He called Bevin "a principled leader" and recalled attending the governor's inaugural address. "Anybody else remember that sunny day?" he asked. But if Pence seemed determined to win over Bevin, his effort to actually sell the health plan released last week by the White House and Republican Congress was a bit more lackluster. Standing before a crowd of more than 100 invitees at Harshaw Trane, an energy company here, Pence spoke for just over 20 minutes, reading from teleprompters a speech that felt as much like a generic campaign pitch as a genuine appeal for the health-care plan. "Most importantly of all, the top priority the president gave us, is to work with members of Congress to make sure the Obamacare nightmare is about to end," Pence said. President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... With Republican Kentucky Reps. Andy Barr and Brett Guthrie in the audience, Pence also made an appeal for his entire party to unite behind the White House's legislation. "Folks, let me be clear, this is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C." he said. "And for us to seize this opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress - and we're counting on Kentucky." In many ways, Kentucky represents the front line of the health-care debate. The number of Kentuckians enrolled in Medicaid has doubled since the end of 2013, with nearly one-third of its residents now in the program. Pence's motorcade passed a group of protesters chanting, "Save our care." Under Obama's health plan, governors were given the option to expand Medicaid - which now covers roughly 10 million people in 31 states and D.C. - in their home states. Steve Beshear, Bevin's Democratic predecessor who expanded Medicaid during his tenure, gave the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's recent joint address to Congress. Bevin, however, has said that Medicaid will ultimately bankrupt the state, and he ended new signups, started under Beshear, to Kentucky's health exchange. Supreme Court arguments in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act are still days away, but already, a sense of impending crisis has hit state officials and patient advocates in many parts of the country. Many worry they have no good options. If the justices rule in favor of the challenge,... Supreme Court arguments in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act are still days away, but already, a sense of impending crisis has hit state officials and patient advocates in many parts of the country. Many worry they have no good options. If the justices rule in favor of the challenge,... Bevin, speaking before Pence on Saturday, played down disagreements within the Republican Party, saying that even most married couples don't agree on everything for the first two days of their relationship - let alone 20 years. He called Obama's health plan a "catastrophe" and a "disaster" that needs to be repealed and replaced. Pence, who was also recently deployed to Ohio and Wisconsin to help push the Republican health plan, sought to cast health care as a yet another bold action the administration has taken early in its term. Trump, Pence said, "made a promise to you, the American people, and as I like to say, this White House is in the promise-keeping business." He then listed several of the White House's accomplishments so far, citing the process underway to end illegal immigration; the Keystone XL and Dakota pipelines; and the most recent jobs report. "The truth is Kentucky is a textbook example of Obamacare's failures," Pence said, before reassuring "the people of Kentucky who might be looking on this morning" that his administration was racing to create a better replacement plan. "We're going to work with the Congress and work with our agency at Health and Human Services, and we're going to have an orderly transition to a better health-care system that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance available for every American," he said. Later, back at the airport preparing to depart for Washington, Pence again paid special attention to Bevin. The two got out of their car to pose for a picture, and Pence gently tugged Bevin's elbow, as if literally trying to pull him a bit closer to his perspective.

President Donald Trump produced a running commentary Monday on FBI Director James Comey's testimony to Congress. Thanks to the length of the hearing and the immediacy of Twitter, Comey was able to comment on the president's commentary without leaving his seat. On whether Russia influenced the 2016 election TRUMP tweet: "The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process." THE FACTS: No such assurance was offered by Comey or his fellow witness at the hearing, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. They did not offer any conclusions about whether Russia succeeded in influencing the election. COMEY: Asked about the tweet while he was still testifying, he voiced "no opinion" on Russia's influence. "We have no information on that subject," he said. "It's not something we looked at." He confirmed, though, that the FBI is investigating whether and how Russia tried to shape the election, a probe he says includes any potential coordination between Trump campaign associates and Russia's government. The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... The FBI is investigating whether Donald Trump's associates coordinated with Russian officials in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election, Director James Comey said Monday in an extraordinary public confirmation of a probe the president has refused to acknowledge, dismissed as fake news... On whether Comey briefed President Obama on Michael Flynn TRUMP tweet: "FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia." THE FACTS: "Refuses to deny" is true, but perhaps misleading. Throughout the hearing, Comey declined to deny any assertion made by his questioners that mentioned Flynn or any other individuals, explaining that the FBI is not in the business of correcting or verifying such reports. Flynn helped Trump in the campaign, became national security adviser at the start of Trump's presidency and was fired after he was found to have misled senior members of the administration about his contacts with Russia's top diplomat to the U.S. On whether there is evidence of collusion with Russia TRUMP tweet: "FBI Director Comey: fmr. DNI Clapper 'right' to say no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump Campaign." THE FACTS: Trump leaves out an important nuance in this tweet about the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Comey agreed there was no evidence of collusion in a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community under Clapper, but that's different than saying no such evidence has been discovered. Before FBI Director James Comey began his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, President Donald Trump was back, compulsively tweeting — and underscoring the growing perception that his allegation that President Barack Obama had Trump's "wires tapped" is nonsensical, his attachment... Before FBI Director James Comey began his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, President Donald Trump was back, compulsively tweeting — and underscoring the growing perception that his allegation that President Barack Obama had Trump's "wires tapped" is nonsensical, his attachment... The Jan. 6 report does not take up the question of contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Instead it focuses on Russia's actions, via cyber operations and propaganda, to try to help Trump's election chances and hurt Hillary Clinton's. Clapper indeed said he had seen no evidence of collusion at the time he left government. But he updated that comment Monday with a statement from spokesman Shawn Turner, saying Clapper "could not account for intelligence or evidence that may have been gathered since the inauguration on January 20th." COMEY, when asked if he was aware of collusion between Trump associates and Russia, beyond the findings of the report: "It's not something I can comment on." ROGERS: "Likewise, I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation's conclusions."

"I'm very pleased to announce the great company ExxonMobil is going to be investing $20 billion in the Gulf Coast and the Gulf Coast region. . . . This was something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulators and so many other things."-- President Donald Trump, video message on Facebook, March 6 "President Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning." -- White House news release on ExxonMobil's investment program, March 6 President Trump claimed undue credit for ExxonMobil's investment announcement - the latest example of the new president's now-predictable formula: A company announces a U.S. jobs plan that predates Trump's presidency. The company gives a nod to Trump's anti-regulation policies. Trump then takes credit for bringing jobs back to the United States. Repeat. Among the many problems with this exercise is that hiring pledges aren't binding. Plans change, and the jobs don't always come to fruition. For example, in 2013, Foxconn announced it would create 500 jobs at a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. The factory was never built, and the jobs never came, The Washington Post's Todd Frankel reported. Yet the company recently announced a plan to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers - a plan that Trump then touted. Trump's claim about the number of Americans out of the labor force is misleading because it accounts for people who choose not to be in the work force such as retirees, students and stay-at-home parents. Trump's claim about the number of Americans out of the labor force is misleading because it accounts for people who choose not to be in the work force such as retirees, students and stay-at-home parents. We took a look at ExxonMobil's investment program, and a host of other corporate decisions that Trump falsely touts as a fulfillment of his promise to bring jobs back to the United States. On March 6, the oil giant announced its "Growing the Gulf" investment plan to spend $20 billion over 10 years in projects in Texas and Louisiana. The company said its plan would create 35,000 construction jobs and 12,000 full-time jobs, through 11 chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects. The company acknowledged that its investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. ExxonMobil's spending plan may seem like a lot, but it represents only 10 percent of the company's current capital spending levels, our colleagues reported: "Those levels would probably increase with higher oil prices. Moreover, ExxonMobil has been a major operator and investor in the Gulf of Mexico region for decades. The gulf accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. domestic oil production." Indeed, ExxonMobil and other oil companies have been expanding and investing in the Gulf Coast for years, using new hydraulic fracturing technologies to extract natural gas and export it overseas. In 2013, when ExxonMobil began its investments, there were more than 120 petrochemical construction projects totaling $80 billion that were announced for the Gulf Coast region, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The White House news release quoted Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, as praising Trump's commitment to "a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment." "The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administration's support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment," Woods said, acknowledging Trump's pro-business policies but stopping short of giving any credit to the administration for his company's business decisions. Trump has credited himself for a host of other corporate decisions. (In fact, his claims about creating jobs are among the most common claims we recorded so far in our 100 Days of Trump's Claims project, tracking every false or misleading claim in Trump's first 100 days.) Here's a running list: Trump's bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke. He claims credit when little or no credit is due to his policies. Moreover, he is counting these jobs as jobs in the bank, when corporate plans frequently change according to market or economic forces. Trump has promised to create 10 million jobs over the next four years, and that ultimately is what he will be judged on. All the job announcements in the world will mean little if actual hiring does not turn up in the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn said he gave Vice President Mike Pence and others "incomplete information" about his calls with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The vice president, apparently relying on information from Flynn, initially said the national security adviser had not discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy, though Flynn later conceded the issue may have come up. Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser. Kellogg had previously been appointed the National Security Council chief of staff and advised Trump during the campaign. Trump is also considering former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a U.S. Navy SEAL, for the post, according to a senior administration official. The Trump team's account of Flynn's discussions with the Russian envoy changed repeatedly over several weeks, including the number of contacts, the dates of those contacts and ultimately, the content of the conversations. A look at three possible national security advisor replacements following Michael Flynn's resignation. Feb. 14, 2017. A look at three possible national security advisor replacements following Michael Flynn's resignation. Feb. 14, 2017. Late last month, the Justice Department warned the White House that Flynn could be in a compromised position as a result of the contradictions between the public depictions of the calls and what intelligence officials knew to be true based on recordings of the conversations, which were picked up as part of routine monitoring of foreign officials' communications in the U.S. A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition. An administration official and two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed the Justice Department warnings on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. It was unclear when Trump and Pence learned about the Justice Department outreach. The Washington Post was the first to report the communication between former acting attorney general Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, and the Trump White House. The Post also first reported last week that Flynn had indeed spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Trump never voiced public support for Flynn after that initial report and continued to keep his national security adviser close. But White House officials sent contradictory messages about Flynn's status. Counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn, while press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was "evaluating the situation" and consulting with Pence about his conversations with the national security adviser. Asked whether the president had been aware that Flynn might have planned to discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said, "No, absolutely not." The Kremlin had confirmed that Flynn was in contact with Kislyak but denied that they talked about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers mounted a fierce defense of Flynn. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee at the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said in a post on Facebook that firing a national security adviser for his contacts with Russia is "not just paranoia but something even worse." Kosachev also expressed frustration at the Trump administration: Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: no one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot.President Donald Trump accepted Flynn's resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading... Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: no one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot.President Donald Trump accepted Flynn's resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading... "Either Trump hasn't found the necessary independence and he's been driven into a corner... or russophobia has permeated the new administration from top to bottom," he said. Kosachev's counterpart at the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, tweeted shortly after the announcement that "it was not Flynn who was targeted but relations with Russia." Flynn's discussions with the Russian raised questions about whether he offered assurances about the incoming administration's new approach. Such conversations would breach diplomatic protocol and possibly violate the Logan Act, a law aimed at keeping citizens from conducting diplomacy. Administration officials said that misleading Pence was ultimately Flynn's downfall, though they insisted he resigned and was not fired by Trump. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Flynn's resignation "does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians." He said the White House has yet to be forthcoming about whether Flynn was acting at the behest of the president or others. The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially...

Flynn's resignation comes as Trump and his top advisers seek to steady the White House after a rocky start. The president, who seeks input from a wide range of business associates, friends and colleagues, has been asking people their opinions on his senior team, including Spicer and chief of staff Reince Priebus. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he was viewed skeptically by some in the administration's national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia. In 2015, he was paid to attend a gala dinner for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed television station, and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the event. Flynn apologized to Pence about the matter on Friday, according to an administration official. The official said Pence was relying on information from Flynn when he went on television and denied that sanctions were discussed with Kislyak.

The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail, current and former U.S. officials said. The message, delivered by Sally Q. Yates and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel, was prompted by concerns that Flynn, when asked about his calls and texts with the Russian diplomat, had told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the Obama administration sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, the officials said. It is unclear what the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, did with the information. Flynn resigned Monday night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. In the waning days of the Obama administration, James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yates' concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that "Flynn had put himself in a compromising position" and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. A senior Trump administration official said before Flynn's resignation that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that "we've been working on this for weeks." The current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn't rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition. The FBI, Yates, Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter. In a Feb. 8 interview with The Washington Post, Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials. One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he "couldn't be certain that the topic never came up." Two officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions. Officials also said there was no evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what Flynn had discussed. Flynn told The Post earlier this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013, when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia.

President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn... U.S. intelligence reports during the 2016 presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn, officials said. Communications between the two continued after Trump's victory on Nov. 8, according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matter. Kislyak, in a brief interview with The Post, confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election, but he declined to say what was discussed. For Yates and other officials, concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama administration on Dec. 29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlin's interference in the election in an attempt to help Trump. After the sanctions were rolled out, the Obama administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation. To the surprise of many U.S. officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Dec. 30 that there would be no response. Trump praised the decision on Twitter. Intelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putin's move. The search turned up Kislyak's communications, which the FBI routinely monitors, and the phone call in question with Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with years of intelligence experience. From that call and subsequent intercepts, FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynn's discussions with Kislyak. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn's comments in the intercepted call to be "highly significant" and "potentially illegal," according to an official familiar with her thinking. Yates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure U.S. statute known as the Logan Act, which bars U.S. citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another country. At the same time, Yates and other law enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act, a statute that has never been used in a prosecution. In addition to the legal and political hurdles, Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia, which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communications. Word of the calls leaked out on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Post columnist David Ignatius. "What did Flynn say, and did it undercut U.S. sanctions?" Ignatius wrote, citing the Logan Act. The next day, a Trump transition official told The Post, "I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever." White House press secretary Sean Spicer, in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 13, said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had "centered on the logistics" of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. "That was it, plain and simple," Spicer added. On Jan. 15, Pence was asked about the phone call during an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation." Citing a conversation he had with Flynn, Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak "did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia." Before the Pence statement on Jan. 15, top Justice Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communications. Pence's statement on CBS made the issue more urgent, current and former officials said, because U.S. intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call, contrary to public statements. The internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan. 19, Obama's last full day in office. Yates, Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter. The officials discussed options, including telling Pence, the incoming White House counsel, the incoming chief of staff or Trump himself. President Donald Trump is "evaluating the situation" regarding his embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn's conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., the White House said Monday, deepening the uncertainty surrounding Flynn's future in the new administration.

Flynn apologized... FBI Director James B. Comey initially opposed notification, citing concerns that it could complicate the agency's investigation. Clapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in, but Yates stayed on as acting attorney general until Jan. 30, when Trump fired her for refusing to defend his executive order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries - an action that had been challenged in court. A turning point came after Jan. 23, when Spicer, in his first official press briefing, again was asked about Flynn's communications with Kislyak. Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue "again last night." There was just "one call," Spicer said. And it covered four subjects: a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir; Christmas greetings; Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil war; and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump. Spicer said that was the extent of the conversation. National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Yates and the senior career national security official spoke to McGahn, the White House counsel, who didn't respond Monday to a request for comment. Trump has declined to publicly back his national security adviser since the news broke. On Monday afternoon, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn. Minutes later, however, Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to reporters. "The president is evaluating the situation," Spicer's statement read. "He's speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: Our national security." And then late Monday, Flynn resigned. The Washington Post's Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller contributed to this report.

One of the enduring myths of President Trump’s political career is the belief that “nothing matters” — that the controversies that surround him have no effect on his standing with the public. The three weeks since Trump’s inauguration have once again proven that untrue: Trump has lost significant ground in public approval in the aftermath of a rough start. Without question, Trump, who won the presidency with a minority of the votes cast, has retained a strong hold on his core supporters, whose loyalty remains ardent. Republicans are more approving of his personal qualities than they were in the fall, according to several ratings. And Trump has plenty of time to turn around the current negative trend in his overall ratings. But the pattern is consistent: After a brief increase in popularity early in his transition, almost all public polls show a decline in Trump’s support, though the exact amount varies. In Gallup’s surveys, Trump’s job approval has gone from an even split the week of his inauguration, with 45% of Americans approving and 45% disapproving, to a 10-point deficit in the latest average, 42% to 52%. Gallup has tracked every American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and before Trump, none hit 50% disapproval for months, sometimes years. Trump has fallen below all but the lowest points for President Obama and into territory plumbed by Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Asked about specific qualities of leadership, Americans in Gallup’s surveys give Trump strong marks for keeping his promises and being a “strong and decisive” leader. But majorities rate him negatively on inspiring confidence, managing the government effectively and being honest. After a tumultuous campaign and transition, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Friday as the least popular incoming president in at least four decades, but a majority of Americans nevertheless express optimism that he will be able to fulfill campaign pledges to boost the... After a tumultuous campaign and transition, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Friday as the least popular incoming president in at least four decades, but a majority of Americans nevertheless express optimism that he will be able to fulfill campaign pledges to boost the... On each of those measures, a vast gulf separates the mostly positive views of Republicans from the negative views of most Democrats. In addition to Gallup, other polls showing a decline in Trump’s job approval include a GOP favorite, Rasmussen, which has shown Trump dropping from a 14-point net approval rating when he started to four points now; YouGov, which has found a 13-point decline; and Quinnipiac, with a 17-point drop. Among major nonpartisan surveys, the only one to depart from the pattern is the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which had Trump’s approval at a two-point deficit when he started and now has him barely in positive territory, with 48% approving and 47% disapproving. For now, what matters most to Trump is holding the support of his core voters. That’s key to his strength in Congress, especially in the House, because his popularity remains high in most Republican-held congressional districts. But if his decline persists, it could weaken Trump’s sway in the Senate, where members need to run statewide. Whether Trump’s approval rating will drop further depends largely on independents and Republicans — he has almost no support to lose among Democrats. If those voters do sour on him, that could pose a threat to Republicans in the midterm election in 2018. The incumbent president’s approval rating historically serves as a good predictor of how many seats his party will lose at midterm. Most presidents lose ground during their first two years. The average decline since World War II is just short of eight points, according to a compilation by Marquette University political scientist Charles Franklin. If Trump follows that pattern, he could end up with an approval rating in the high 30s — perilous territory for congressional candidates running in swing districts.

The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Donald Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers filed a notice to appeal the Seattle federal judge's decision from Friday night that imposed a temporary, nationwide halt to Trump's order barring refugees and those from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the country. While his administration followed the orders of U.S. District Judge James Robart, the president blasted out his unhappiness with an extraordinarily personal criticism. "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" Trump said in a Saturday morning tweet. On a weekend trip to Florida, Trump went off to play golf, then returned to Twitter in the afternoon to say "many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country" because of the judicial decision. Trump exaggerated the impact of Robart's order, and Democrats charged that the president was trying to intimidate the independent judiciary. "The president's hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous," Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement. He was known for that sort of thing. "The amicus law professors," Robart said Friday, noting the many groups that waited in his Seattle courtroom to argue for or against a motion to halt President... He was known for that sort of thing. "The amicus law professors," Robart said Friday, noting the many groups that waited in his Seattle courtroom to argue for or against a motion to halt President... The State Department said that those with valid visas could enter the country. DHS said it would "resume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure" that existed before Trump's more restrictive executive order. Advocates encouraged travelers from the affected countries who qualified for entry to get on planes as soon as possible because of the unpredictable legal terrain. The developments continued what has been a chaotic rollout of Trump's order, made on Jan. 27. More than a dozen legal challenges have been filed around the country, and only one judge so far has indicated that he was willing to let Trump's order stand. The decision of Robart, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and has been on the bench since 2004, was the most consequential because of its national implications. It is somewhat unusual for a district judge to issue an order that affects the entire country, but Robart said it was necessary to follow Congress's intention that "the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly." He was quoting from a 2015 appeals court ruling that had blocked President Barack Obama's executive action that would have made it easier for undocumented immigrants in this country to remain. It was never implemented because of legal challenges. Up to 60,000 foreigners from seven majority-Muslim countries had their visas canceled after President Donald Trump's executive order blocked them from traveling to the U.S., the State Department said Friday. That figure contradicts a Justice Department lawyer's statement Friday during a court hearing... Up to 60,000 foreigners from seven majority-Muslim countries had their visas canceled after President Donald Trump's executive order blocked them from traveling to the U.S., the State Department said Friday. That figure contradicts a Justice Department lawyer's statement Friday during a court hearing... Justice Department lawyers were preparing to immediately ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to dissolve Robart's order, but had not filed anything as of Saturday evening. It will go to a panel of judges who consider such emergency requests, and that decision could be crucial. While the losing side can then request intervention from the Supreme Court, it would take the votes of five justices to overturn the panel decision. The court has been shorthanded since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago, and ideologically divided between four liberal and four conservative members. The issue could reach the high court in days - or weeks. Robart granted a request from attorneys for the states of Washington and Minnesota who had asked him to stop the government from acting on critical sections of Trump's order. Justice and State department officials had revealed earlier Friday that about 60,000 - and possibly as many as 100,000 - visas already have been provisionally revoked as a result of Trump's order. A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that because of the court case, officials would examine the revoking of those visas so that people would be allowed to travel. Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries who were turned away from the United States due to President Donald Trump's travel ban are rushing to try again, hoping to make it through a narrow window opened by legal challenges. The federal appeals court in San Francisco denied Trump's effort... Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries who were turned away from the United States due to President Donald Trump's travel ban are rushing to try again, hoping to make it through a narrow window opened by legal challenges. The federal appeals court in San Francisco denied Trump's effort... Robart's order also enjoined the government from enforcing a section of the executive order that bars the entry of Syrian refugees. The State Department said it is still working with other government agencies and the organizations that process refugees overseas to comply with the judge's order. That means the action may not immediately help those seeking approval. Immigration lawyers said the State Department had informed them they should rebook trips for refugees whose plans were canceled after the executive order, which temporarily halted the refugee resettlement program. On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would allow 872 refugees into the country who were "already in transit" and would face "undue hardship" if denied admission. "This ruling is another stinging rejection of President Trump's unconstitutional Muslim ban," said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project. "We will keep fighting to permanently dismantle this un-American executive order." Trump's criticism of Robart reminded some of his remarks during the presidential campaign about the impartiality of a California federal judge who was hearing a class-action lawsuit involving Trump University. Editor's Note: Prior to publication of this column, The Post sought comment from the Department of Homeland Security but not from the White House. We should have done both.

After publication, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Post that Stephen Bannon did not travel to see Homeland... Others counted that Obama had also been critical of judicial decisions he did not like - scolding the Supreme Court during a State of the Union address for its decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and saying during the legal battle over the Affordable Care Act that it would be "unprecedented" to strike it down. But Trump's denunciation of Robart was more personal and direct. Vice President Mike Pence defended the president's words in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that will air on ABC's "This Week." "I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them," Pence said. He agreed with Stephanopoulos that Robart had the authority for his ruling, and said "we'll go through the process in the courts to get a stay of that order, so that, again, we can implement this action that is entirely focused on the safety and security of the American people." A federal judge in Washington state declared Friday that he would temporarily block enforcement of President Donald Trump's controversial ban on entry to the United States, and government authorities immediately began taking steps that would allow those previously affected to travel, according... A federal judge in Washington state declared Friday that he would temporarily block enforcement of President Donald Trump's controversial ban on entry to the United States, and government authorities immediately began taking steps that would allow those previously affected to travel, according... Other Republican leaders were mute, on both the decision and Trump's language, and some in the GOP were unsettled by it. "My advice to POTUS - attack the decision (it's weak) not the judge," Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, who had backed Trump's immigration order, wrote on Twitter. "Liberals are imploding, don't make personal attacks the story." Democrats were not shy. "The president's attack . . . shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. Leahy said Trump "seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis." The legal battles over Trump's immigration order have become the mirror image of Obama's attempt to shield illegal immigrants after Congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Obama's executive action would have deferred deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants who had been in the country since 2010, had not committed any serious crimes and had family ties to U.S. citizens or others lawfully in the country. Late Friday night, some of President Donald Trump's top advisers huddled on the phone to craft a response to a court ruling that blocked the White House's refugee and immigration ban. The White House statement slammed the order as "outrageous." But the president's lawyers quickly raised objections... Late Friday night, some of President Donald Trump's top advisers huddled on the phone to craft a response to a court ruling that blocked the White House's refugee and immigration ban. The White House statement slammed the order as "outrageous." But the president's lawyers quickly raised objections... In that case, Republican state attorneys general led the fight against the order. A district judge in Texas agreed with them that it probably exceeded the president's powers, and issued a nationwide injunction. Months later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit agreed; months after that, the Supreme Court took up the issue. But the court deadlocked, meaning that the lower court ruling stood and the Obama administration suffered one of its most consequential legal defeats. The players have changed sides now, with Democratic attorneys general and immigrant rights groups leading the fight against Trump and celebrating a district judge's imposition of a nationwide order.

Even as confusion, internal dissent and widespread condemnation greeted President Trump’s travel ban and crackdown on refugees this weekend, senior White House aides say they are are only getting started. Trump and his aides justified Friday’s executive order, which blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days and halted refugees from around the world for 120, on security grounds — an issue that they say they take seriously. But their ultimate goal is far broader. Trump’s top advisors on immigration, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, see themselves as launching a radical experiment to fundamentally transform how the U.S. decides who is allowed into the country and to block a generation of people who, in their view, won’t assimilate into American society. That project may live or die in the next three months, as the Trump administration reviews whether and how to expand the visa ban and alter vetting procedures. White House aides are considering new, onerous security checks that could effectively limit travel into the U.S. by people from majority-Muslim countries to a trickle. The administration faced down another torrent of criticism Monday — from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, career diplomats, national security experts and world leaders — over the hasty rollout of the order, as well as the message it sent to both friends and adversaries in the war on terrorism. Though Trump’s ban does not affect all Muslims, as he promised during the campaign, many see it as religiously targeted. President Obama also weighed in for the first time, saying through a spokesman that he "is heartened" by the public demonstrations against it. Obama did not cite specific language from the order, but spokesman Kevin Lewis said Obama "fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion." The government bureaucracy also began a swift and startling level of resistance to the new president’s initiative, punctuated by a letter from acting U.S. Atty. Gen. Sally Yates, who declared that she would refuse to defend the order in court against a series of lawsuits. Trump immediately counterpunched, firing Yates within hours Monday night and replacing her with Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern district of Virginia, on an acting basis. A group of U.S. diplomats circulated an internal memo through a State Department process that allows them to privately express dissent, arguing that Trump’s order “runs counter to core American values of non-discrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants. "A policy which closes our doors to over 200-million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans ... will not achieve its aim of making our country safer," said a draft version of the memo.

The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican... The Pentagon, with written support from Republican military veterans serving in Congress, began compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the armed forces and is recommending that they be exempt from Trump’s temporary ban on entry to the U.S. by people from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. The move could potentially shield tens of thousands of Iraqi interpreters, advisors, and others who have assisted the U.S. military from the president’s controversial action. The list will include names of individuals who have “demonstrated their commitment” to helping the U.S., Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday. “Even people that are doing seemingly benign things in support of us — whether as a linguist, a driver, anything else — they often do that at great personal risk,” he said. “So people who take these risks are really making a tangible signal of support to the United States, and that’s something that will, and should be, recognized." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration recognizes the help of Iraqi interpreters and others who have served this country, but added that they would remain subject to intense vetting. “We should make sure that in those cases they're helped out,” he said. “But that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass.” Despite the backlash, senior White House officials maintain that the ban is popular with Trump’s voters, though no reputable polling on the question has been released since Friday’s order. Spicer said media coverage of the implementation had been overblown, given that only 109 of 325,000 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours. He said Trump is putting in place proactive security measures rather than reacting to attacks. “I'm sorry that some folks may have had to wait a little while, but I think the president would much rather know that he's not placing a call to someone who was killed because someone was let into this country to commit a terrorist act,” he said. Still, the countries of origin for perpetrators of several prominent attacks cited by Spicer were not on the list of banned countries. Spicer and other administration officials said more countries could be added. Spicer had little sympathy for dissenting diplomats, saying their disagreement with the policy calls “into question whether or not they should continue in that post or not.” On Jan. 18, President Barack Obama told reporters in his final news conference that he would comment on his successor's actions only at "certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake." He managed to stay quiet for less than two weeks. Obama, who is still on vacation with his family... On Jan. 18, President Barack Obama told reporters in his final news conference that he would comment on his successor's actions only at "certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake." He managed to stay quiet for less than two weeks. Obama, who is still on vacation with his family... Yet they were hardly the only ones voicing concern. Phone lines throughout the Capitol were jammed with constituents asking questions and raising concerns over the order. White House aides fought back against characterizations that they had kept the order to themselves, pointing to input they had gotten for months from allies. Senior GOP staff on the House and Senate judiciary committees helped write a version of the executive order on their own time during Trump’s transition. They based its legal wording on the harsh immigration policy Trump laid out on the campaign trail. During a speech in Phoenix in August, Trump promised to suspend immigration from “places like Syria and Libya” and create an “ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.” But several stakeholders said they were left out. One Republican senator who contacted the White House on Sunday seeking guidance failed to get full clarification, according to an aide. Two GOP aides complained that Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the Homeland Security committee, had “absolutely no role” in drafting Trump’s final order. They said that a memo McCaul drafted with former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a longtime Trump supporter, and others focused largely on explaining “why the Muslim ban was a terrible idea." The aides disputed that Trump’s order amounted to a Muslim ban, noting that Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world, was not on it. "It’s self-evident that the coordination of this executive order was bungled, that that has had consequences, and we hope that in the future the White House will more proactively engage congress and the agencies that are effected,” said one of Republican leadership aides, granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The chief architects of Trump’s order, Bannon, Miller and National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, forged strong bonds during the presidential campaign. A chorus that began in Silicon Valley is gaining voices across corporate America, as more business leaders from other industries speak out against President Donald Trump's travel ban prohibiting entry of migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries or touted their commitments to diversity. A chorus that began in Silicon Valley is gaining voices across corporate America, as more business leaders from other industries speak out against President Donald Trump's travel ban prohibiting entry of migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries or touted their commitments to diversity. The trio, who make up part of Trump’s inner circle, have a dark view of refugee and immigration flows from majority-Muslim countries, believing that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate disaffected and disenfranchised immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years. Within decades, Americans would have “the kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multidimensional and multigenerational and becomes sort of a permanent feature,” one senior administration official argued. “We don’t want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it’s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,” the official said. Counter-terrorism experts have long noted that Muslim immigrants in the U.S. are better assimilated and less likely to be radicalized than immigrants in many European cities. But the connection between immigration, security, economics and culture that defines the nationalist ideology of Bannon and Miller has become intertwined in Trump’s own rhetoric. “Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,” Trump tweeted over the weekend. “Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world — a horrible mess!” Times staff writers Lisa Mascaro, Michael A.

The fallout Monday of President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration order exposed tender rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet, fueled suspicions among his top advisers - and left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame. For all the promises of Republican bonhomie, Trump and his aides kept GOP congressional leaders almost completely in the dark about the most consequential act of his young presidency: a temporary ban on refugees and on anyone from seven majority-Muslim nations. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them. Inside the West Wing, tensions flickered as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by chief strategist Stephen Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of chief of staff Reince Priebus and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command. Miller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move in television interviews. As it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump's orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public. "The problem they've got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump. In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... The infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller. "This weekend was a disgrace and it's all on your shoulders," Scarborough intoned. His commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., recently appeared, he received a congratulatory call from Trump just moments later. Scarborough's monologue encapsulated many of the hallmarks of the new White House: It was direct, passionate and provocative, and it played out on live television. Scarborough's analysis aligned with a faction of the West Wing that has grown concerned about the ascent of Miller and Bannon, close partners in driving Trump to make good on his most populist and nationalistic campaign promises, however incendiary. One area of heated debate is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal protection to undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children - commonly known as "dreamers." Hardline conservatives have been urging Trump to rescind DACA, while other advisers, including Gingrich, are counseling him to keep it in place and avoid a politically treacherous confrontation, according to people involved in the deliberations. "Why pick a fight over this group of people who have a lot of emotional stories to tell? It's not realistic. It's not practical," Gingrich said. "I strongly agree with the general direction we're going, but I think this particular fight doesn't emotionally make any sense." In many ways, Trump's leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials - Bannon and Miller chief among them - are actively shaping policy and guiding the president's decisions. Others - such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer - function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions. The Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus's wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception. Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing... Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing... The competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues' motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. "A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing," one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. "We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he's seeing shadows where there are no shadows." During the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions. But Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House. White House officials reject the notion that chaos has overshadowed the early days of Trump's presidency. They say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order. "While false narratives circulate, the White House staff is busy working, together, to implement President Trump's agenda for the betterment of our country," said a White House spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record. Trump fired off angry tweets attacking the media and lawmakers who criticized his ban, from mocking Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for his "tears" to labeling Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., "sadly weak." Privately, the president seethed, venting about what he saw as unfair news coverage on a second straight weekend of mass protests, and quizzing confidants about their impressions of how his senior staffers were performing. As the controversy swirled, Trump, who has taken to giving visitors mini-tours of his new residence, found comfort in a trio of loyalists who share a room just steps from the Oval Office - Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman who has been at Trump's side since before his campaign launch; Johnny McEntee, a former college football quarterback who is now the president's personal aide; and Keith Schiller, a retired New York police officer and head of Trump's personal security detail who now directs Oval Office operations. Nonetheless, some of Trump's friends as well as his critics fear that his agenda may be compromised by mismanagement. "Frankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff," said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump's primary rivals. "If I were the president, I'd be very upset with the staff - that they didn't say, 'Hey, wait, hold on a second.' Because that's what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, 'Hey, your message is fine but here is what's going to come from it.' " On Capitol Hill, many Republicans close to leadership were frustrated that they received little to no guidance, or advance notice, about Trump's immigration and refugee directive. One top House office said it was able to glean the president's plan only through unofficial back channels to the Department of Homeland Security. Asked if he was consulted in drafting the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., replied simply, "I wasn't" - an echo of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who told reporters Monday that the White House had not briefed him before signing the order. The first substantive guidance to congressional Republicans came late Saturday - well after protesters had descended on the nation's airports - in a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy but, to the chagrin of several Capitol Hill aides, very little political guidance. At the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on "victims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals." Washington state's attorney general declared Monday that he was suing President Donald Trump over his temporary ban on immigration from seven countries with majority-Muslim populations, making it the first state to announce a legal action against the Trump administration over one of its policies. Washington state's attorney general declared Monday that he was suing President Donald Trump over his temporary ban on immigration from seven countries with majority-Muslim populations, making it the first state to announce a legal action against the Trump administration over one of its policies. It was not only Trump's immigration order that rankled official Washington. His presidential memorandum that restructured the National Security Council to elevate Bannon to a seat on the Principals Committee, alongside the secretaries of state and defense, worried many in the national security community. Also concerning was language suggesting that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could only attend certain Principals Committee meetings. But Spicer told reporters Monday that Trump was revising the directive to also include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he insisted that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chairman would be included in any Principals Committee meeting they wish to attend. The confusion out of the White House about the president's intentions left some of the government's most decorated officials scrambling to assert their relevance. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, took the unusual step of issuing a statement to emphasize that he will "fully participate" in giving the president military advice. "I remain honored and humbled to represent the extraordinary men and women of the Joint Force in serving the president and our nation," Dunford wrote.

President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered the Pentagon to devise a strategy to defeat the Islamic State and restructured the National Security Council to include his controversial top political adviser, as he forged a partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin in their first official phone call. Trump and Putin spoke for one hour and vowed to join forces to fight terrorism in Syria and elsewhere, according to the White House and the Kremlin, signaling a potential shift in U.S.-Russian relations that have been marked by high tension. Meanwhile, Trump signed a presidential memo directing the Pentagon to submit a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State, an effort to make good on his campaign promise to more aggressively confront Islamist terrorism than President Barack Obama did. Even before Saturday's order, military officials had been at work developing potential actions for Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis to consider. Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing U.S. military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders. As he signed his directive at his desk in the Oval Office, Trump said, "I think it's going to be very successful. That's big stuff."

One week into office, President Donald Trump was trying to clean up his first international incident. The president shifted a jam-packed schedule Friday to make room for an hourlong phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who had abruptly snubbed the new president by canceling a visit.... Counseling Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. In an executive order, Trump reorganized the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee - the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defense and state. Trump's order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their "responsibilities and expertise." In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees. The White House thinks the changes will make the NSC more adaptive to modern threats. Trump said the changes would bring "a lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety." The changes affirm the ascent of Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists, who has emerged as Trump's political consigliere and the keeper of the president's populist flame. Bannon has already been playing a major role in directing Trump's foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on Saturday for his calls with Putin and several other world leaders. In their call, Putin and Trump discussed Ukraine and Syria, and they agreed to build stronger economic ties between the United States and Russia, according to a statement issued by the Kremlin. They said they would arrange an in-person meeting, but Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Interfax news agency that the two presidents did not specifically talk about a lifting of the sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia over Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. President Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration’s foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first official president-to-president contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

As his top aides looked on, Trump sat in the... Eliminating the sanctions is a priority for Moscow, but Trump is under pressure in the United States to maintain them and said Friday that he thought it was premature to consider lifting them. The White House described the conversation as "a congratulatory call" initiated by Putin. "The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair," read a statement from the White House. "Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today's call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern." This was one of five conversations Trump had Saturday with world leaders. Seeking to cultivate a personal rapport, Trump spoke with the leaders of Australia, France, Germany and Japan, but his administration's suspension of the acceptance of all refugees and a suspension of entry by citizens from seven majority-Muslim nations injected some diplomatic tension into the conversations. In their call, French President François Hollande told Trump that he believes defending their democracies would be effective only if their governments adhere to "the principles on which they are founded, in particular the reception of refugees," according to the Elysee Palace, the French president's office. Trump's conversation with Putin was hotly anticipated, considering the warmth with which each man has spoken of the other.

President Donald Trump joined his chief strategist Friday in characterizing the media as "the opposition party," expressing an unusually high level of antagonism toward the press just a week into his administration. Trump, echoing comments made by strategist Steve Bannon earlier this week, told... Trump spoke with Putin from behind his desk in the Oval Office, which was stacked with papers and a glass of Diet Coke. The president was flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, national security adviser Michael Flynn, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and Bannon. Trump began the day with a call to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss security and trade issues between the two countries and the mutual threat posed by North Korea, according to the White House. Abe, who during Trump's transition phase became the first foreign leader to talk face-to-face with the president-elect, agreed to meet Trump during a visit to Washington on Feb. 10, according to the White House. Trump then spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he had blasted repeatedly on the campaign trail over the German policy of admitting large numbers of Syrian refugees. Trump and Merkel covered a range of issues, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to the White House. After Trump's criticism of NATO during his campaign, the president and Merkel agreed on the alliance's "fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community," read a White House statement. President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the "alt-right" movement, which white nationalists have embraced.

Trump accepted Merkel's invitation to visit Hamburg, in July for the G-20 summit, and Trump invited the chancellor to visit Washington soon, the White House said. Later Saturday, Trump talked with Hollande as well as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Hollande told Trump that it was important to maintain the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Hollande's office. Trump has said he wants the United States to withdraw from the accord. In Moscow, leaders had expressed cautious optimism that the new American leader could forge stronger ties than Obama did. From Moscow's point of view, lifting the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for interference in the presidential election and Russia's intervention in Ukraine would be a good start, as would a reduction of NATO's military presence near Russia's borders. Trump has said he sees his posture toward Putin as in the geopolitical interests of the United States. He has consistently argued that Russia can be a strong ally, saying the two countries could cooperate on counterterrorism as well as countering nuclear proliferation. U.S. lawmakers from both parties - as well as some of Trump's Cabinet nominees - have raised alarms, or at least questioned, his approach. Also on Saturday, Trump signed an executive order finalizing new lobbying rules that had been informally established during the transition period. It stipulates that administration officials cannot register as lobbyists for five years after leaving the government - and can never lobby on behalf of a foreign government. "Most of the people standing behind me won't be able to go to work or do anything adverse to our wonderful country," Trump said, as the aides standing behind him in the Oval Office laughed.

President Donald Trump joined his chief strategist Friday in characterizing the media as "the opposition party," expressing an unusually high level of antagonism toward the press just a week into his administration. Trump, echoing comments made by strategist Steve Bannon earlier this week, told CBN News that a "big portion of the media" is guilty of "dishonesty, total deceit and deception. It makes them certainly partially the opposition party." Trump continued that the media is "much more capable than the opposition party. The opposition party is losing badly. Now the media is on the opposition party's side." Speaking to the New York Times on Wednesday, Bannon said, “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country." But Trump's antagonism toward the media just a week after he took the oath of office is far from the norm, historians said Friday, citing the many past presidents who made at least the appearance of reaching out to the press. "To come right out of the blocks in this extremely adversarial stance is kind of unprecedented," said David Greenberg, a professor of history at Rutgers University who has written about the Nixon presidency. "Even when Nixon began he promised an open administration." Trump's statement extends the tenor he struck with the media even before he took office, said Mark Updegrove, the director of the LBJ Presidential Library who is also a presidential historian. A week in, it's clear that there will no honeymoon period for this president with the media, he said. "Trump made no secret of how he felt about the press during the campaign and during the transition. That was unusual. So there were shots that were fired well before the inauguration and it portended the relationship," Updegrove said. Greenberg, a former reporter and editor, said the media has played a consciously adversarial role with the presidency since the 1960s or 1970s, seeing it as their job to hold power to account and investigate administrations. Criticism of the media can resonate with a president's supporters. But Trump's criticism is outsized, he said. "Most presidents find themselves lashing out, or at least being privately upset at how they're treated. I think its human nature. Trump is just an extreme case," he said. Associated Press

FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request on Saturday after Trump accused Obama on Twitter of having his "'wires tapped' in Trump Tower." The White House expanded on Trump's comments Sunday with a call for a congressional probe of his allegations. The revelation, first reported by the New York Times, underscores the fraught nature of the FBI's high-profile investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. A key question fueling that inquiry is whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials to help Trump win. Neither Justice nor the FBI would comment Sunday. The development came as Trump's charge against Obama - leveled without any evidence - was being rebuffed both inside and outside of the executive branch. It drew a blunt, on-the-record denial by a top intelligence official who served in the Obama administration. Speaking on NBC News on Sunday morning, former director of national intelligence James Clapper denied that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap was authorized against Trump or the campaign during his tenure. "There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign," Clapper said on "Meet the Press," adding that he would "absolutely" have been informed if the FBI had received a FISA warrant against either. "I can deny it," Clapper said emphatically. In his claims early Saturday morning, the president tweeted that he "just found out" that Obama had "my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" before the election, comparing it to "McCarthyism." "Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election?" Trump asked in another tweet. "Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!" By Sunday morning, the White House doubled down on Trump's explosive tweetstorm and called for the congressional probe. Current and former government officials said such surveillance would not have been approved by any senior Justice official in the Obama administration. And Trump's allegation raised hackles in the FBI leadership, insinuating as it did that the bureau may have acted illegally to wiretap a presidential candidate without probable cause that he was an "agent of a foreign power," as the foreign intelligence surveillance law requires. "This is Nixon/Watergate," Trump tweeted Saturday. A spokesman for Obama countered several hours later that the former president never authorized a wiretap of Trump or any other American citizen. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply false," the spokesman said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday cited "reports" of "potentially politically motivated investigations" during the 2016 campaign, calling them "troubling." But none of the media reports cited by the White House provides evidence of a politically motivated surveillance effort against Trump. "President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016," Spicer said. "Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted," the statement added.

President Donald Trump walks toward Marine One to depart the White House en route to Langley Air Force Base on March 2, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Congressional committees in both the House and the Senate are probing not just suspected Russian efforts to undermine the 2016 election but any contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Comey's request is sure to raise eyebrows in light of his actions last year in the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. Last July he held a news conference - without telling the Justice Department what he would say - to announce that the bureau had concluded Clinton did not commit a prosecutable offense. Then, 11 days before the election, Comey wrote Congress despite warnings from senior Justice officials that doing so would violate department policy and said the FBI was examining new emails that had come to light. Nothing came of the bureau's additional review, but Comey took heat for his actions, which Democrats say influenced the outcome of the election. It is not clear why Comey, who is the senior-most law enforcement officer who has been overseeing the FBI investigation from its inception in the Obama administration, did not himself issue a statement to refute Trump's claims. Nor is it clear to whom he made his request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last week from all investigative matters related to the Trump campaign and any potential Russia links. The acting Deputy Attorney General, Dana Boente, a career federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, is now overseeing the probe. Trump's tweets early Saturday may have been prompted by the comments of a conservative radio host, which were summarized in an article on the conservative website Breitbart. The Breitbart story had been circulating among Trump's senior aides on Friday. The White House's escalation of Trump's claims were kept at arm's length by congressional Republicans appearing on Sunday morning news broadcasts. When asked about Trump's allegations, Senate Intelligence Committee member Tom Cotton, R-Ark., declined to comment on the tweets but said he has "seen no evidence of the allegations." "Whether that's a FISA court application or denial of that application or a re-submission of that application, that doesn't mean that none of these things happened. It just means we haven't seen that yet," Cotton added, speaking on Fox News Sunday. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he is not aware of evidence to back up the president's claim. "I have no insight into exactly what he's referring to," he said on "Meet the Press." "The president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer for exactly what he was referring to." Obama's allies were more blunt, denying flatly that the former president had ordered a wiretap of Trump's campaign. "This may come as a surprise to the current occupant of the Oval Office, but the president of the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order the wiretapping of American citizens," said former Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told "Meet the Press" that Trump is "in trouble" and acting "beneath the dignity of the presidency." "How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very...

Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very... "The president's in trouble if he falsely spread this kind of information," Schumer said. "It shows this president doesn't know how to conduct himself." Earnest added that Trump was attempting to distract from the controversy involving contacts between his campaign aides, including now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Russian officials. "We know exactly why president Trump tweeted what he tweeted," Earnest added. "Because there is one page in the Trump White House crisis management playbook, and that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal. And the bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet." Trump's tweets early Saturday may have been prompted by the comments of a conservative radio host, which were summarized in an article on the conservative website Breitbart. The Breitbart story had been circulating among Trump's senior aides on Friday. But appearing on ABCs "This Week," White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly said that the president's allegation was worth looking into. "He's asking that we get down to the bottom of this, let's get the truth here, let's find out," Huckabee Sanders said. "I think the bigger story isn't who reported it, but is it true. And I think the American people have a right to know if this happened, because if it did, again, this is the largest abuse of power that, I think, we have ever seen." Asked whether Trump truly believes Obama wiretapped him, Huckabee Sanders deflected. "I would say that his tweet speaks for itself there," she said. Clapper's comments referred only to whether Trump campaign officials had been wiretapped. But their conversations could also have been captured by routine surveillance of Russian diplomats or intelligence operatives. U.S. monitoring of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, for example, caught his conversations with Trump adviser Michael Flynn during the campaign. Flynn went on to become Trump's national security adviser, but he was forced to resign last month after admitting that he had misled other senior Trump officials about the nature of those conversations. The FBI and the National Security Agency also have obtained intercepted communications among Russians officials in which they refer to conversations with members of the Trump team, current and former U.S. officials have said. On the broader question of apparent Russian interference in the 2016 election, Clapper urged congressional investigators to attempt to settle the issue, which he said has become a "distraction" in the political sphere. The intelligence community found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government - at least until the end of the Obama administration, he said Sunday. "We had no evidence of such collusion," he said on "Meet the Press." But Clapper added a caveat: "This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left government." Whether there was any collusion is a key question fueling a wide-ranging federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Jan. 6, the U.S. spy agencies collectively released a report concluding that Russia carried out cyberhacks and other "active measures" with an intent to help Trump and harm the campaign and potential presidency of Hillary Clinton. The report, Clapper pointed out, included "no evidence" of collusion with the Trump campaign. But the investigation by the FBI, the NSA and the CIA continues. The Senate and House intelligence committees also are conducting investigations. The Washington Post's Aaron Blake, Greg Jaffe, Robert Costa, Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump is "extremely confident" that the Justice Department will find evidence to back up his claim that former president Barack Obama "had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" during the presidential campaign, even as the White House seeks to discourage the public from taking the president's comments literally. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the president believes he will be "vindicated" when the Justice Department provides such evidence to a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which the White House asked to investigate Trump's claims. The committee extended its deadline to Monday for the department to provide any evidence bolstering Trump's claim. Except for media reports that do not support the wiretapping assertion, the White House has provided no evidence that Obama ordered surveillance against Trump or his campaign. "I think he's extremely confident," Spicer said, when asked whether Justice will have evidence to provide the House panel. "I think there is significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. "I'll leave it to them to issue their report, but I think he feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate" him, Spicer added. On Monday, Spicer argued that Trump did not mean that Obama personally wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower. "I think recognizing that he doesn't really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally, I think," Spicer said. "But I think there is no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election." Facing a Monday deadline, the Justice Department asked lawmakers for more time to provide evidence backing up President Donald Trump's unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election.

Facing a Monday deadline, the Justice Department asked lawmakers for more time to provide evidence backing up President Donald Trump's unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. The request came as the White House appeared to soften Trump's explosive... Earlier, in an interview released Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway floated that the surveillance could have occurred through a microwave, a statement she later sought to walk back. Asked whether the president believes that televisions and microwaves could have been used to surveil Trump during the election, Spicer ruled out microwaves, but declined to be more specific. "I'm just going to say the president has tweeted about this. He's pretty clear he believes there was surveillance conducted during the 2016 election," Spicer said. "I think there's pretty sound evidence that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone. "I think that has been cleaned up. It was made in jest, so I think we can put that to rest," he added.

Facing a Monday deadline, the Justice Department asked lawmakers for more time to provide evidence backing up President Donald Trump's unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. The request came as the White House appeared to soften Trump's explosive allegation. The House intelligence committee said it would give the Justice Department until March 20 to comply with the evidence request. That's the date of the committee's first open hearing on the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia. A spokesman for the committee's Republican chairman said that if the Justice Department doesn't meet the new deadline, the panel might use its subpoena power to gather information. "If the committee does not receive a response by then, the committee will ask for this information during the March 20 hearing and may resort to a compulsory process if our questions continue to go unanswered," said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says she doesn't have any evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phone lines during the election. Instead, Conway is pointing to recent revelations about other government surveillance to suggest it... Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says she doesn't have any evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phone lines during the election. Instead, Conway is pointing to recent revelations about other government surveillance to suggest it... Trump's assertions have put his administration in a bind. Current and former administration officials have been unable to provide any evidence of the Obama administration wiretapping Trump Tower, yet the president's aides have been reluctant to publicly contradict their boss. White House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to clarify Trump's comments Monday, saying the president wasn't using the word wiretapping literally, noting that Trump had put the term in quotation marks. "The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities," Spicer said. He also suggested Trump wasn't accusing former President Barack Obama specifically, but instead referring to the actions of the Obama administration. Trump himself has not commented on the matter since his March 4 tweets, in which he said he had "just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory." He also wrote: "Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president?" In two other tweets, Trump described Obama tapping his phones, but did not put the phrases in quotation marks. The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its namesake has charged, a request reinforced Sunday by an influential Republican senator who says the president must either come up with the evidence... The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its namesake has charged, a request reinforced Sunday by an influential Republican senator who says the president must either come up with the evidence... The president's accusations against Obama came amid numerous political questions surrounding his associates' possible ties to Russia. The FBI is investigating Trump associates' contacts with Russia during the election, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. The White House has asked those committees to also investigate Trump's unverified wiretapping allegations against Obama. The House committee has turned the matter back on the Trump administration, setting the Monday deadline for the Justice Department to provide evidence. In a response Monday evening, the Justice Department said it needed extra time to "review the request in compliance with the governing legal authorities and to determine what if any responsive documents may exist." Other congressional committees are also pushing the administration to clarify Trump's claims. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente and FBI Director James Comey to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department's criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps. The senators, who head the Senate Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee, are seeking warrant applications and court orders, which they said can be scrubbed to protect secret intelligence sources and methods. Trump's critics have slammed the president for making the wiretapping claim on his Twitter account without evidence. Wiretapping a U.S. citizen would require special permission from a court, and Trump as president would have the ability to declassify that information. Sen. John McCain, an influential Republican, said Sunday: "I think the president has one of two choices: either retract or to provide the information that the American people deserve." "If his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least," McCain said. Comey has privately urged the Justice Department to dispute Trump's claim but has not come forward to do so himself. James Clapper, who was Obama's director of national intelligence, has said that nothing matching Trump's claims had taken place. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway sidestepped questions about the lack of proof Monday, saying she was "not in the job of having evidence." "That's what investigations are for," Conway told CNN's "New Day." "The president is pleased that the House and Senate intelligence committees have agreed that this should be part of the investigation that already exists about Russia and the campaign, an investigation that apparently has gone nowhere so far." In a weekend interview with the Bergen Record, a newspaper in her home state of New Jersey, Conway appeared to point toward the recent WikiLeaks release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA's tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs. "What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other now, unfortunately," including "microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera," Conway said. "So we know that that is just a fact of modern life." Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.

Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George W. Bush's Justice Department before being appointed to the federal bench and authoring a series of sharply written, conservative opinions. His mother, Anne, ran President Ronald Reagan's Environmental Protection Agency. But Gorsuch has also won praise among liberals and others in the Colorado legal community for his fair-mindedness and defense of the underdog. "He is a very, very smart man. His leanings are very conservative, but he's qualified to be on the Supreme Court," said Denver plaintiff's attorney David Lane. "I don't know that Judge Gorsuch has a political agenda and he is sincere and honest and believes what he writes." President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come.

President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court... A judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Gorsuch lives in the hyper-liberal college town of Boulder and teaches at the University of Colorado's law school there, also a progressive bastion. "I think this should be Merrick Garland's seat," said Jordan Henry, one of Gorsuch's students there and a self-described liberal, referring to President Obama's nominee for the vacancy last year who was never considered by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. But she described Gorsuch as an eager mentor, always solicitous of students' opinions and with a brilliant mind. "He's dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the justice system," said Henry, 29. "I do take some comfort that he can be a Trump choice." Gorsuch is a Colorado native who earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in three years, then earned a law degree from Harvard. He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White, a fellow Coloradan, and Anthony Kennedy before earning a philosophy degree at Oxford University and working for a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm. He served for two years in Bush's Justice Department before Bush appointed him to a seat on the 10th Circuit in 2006. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, served as administrator of the EPA, but she was forced to resign 1983 amid a scandal involving the mismanagement of a $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps. Burford was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over Superfund records, which she claimed were protected by executive privilege. Neil Gorsuch has contended that courts give too much deference to government agencies' interpretations of statutes, a deference that stems from a Supreme Court ruling in a 1984 case. More recently, he sided with two groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements that employers provide health insurance that includes contraception. Gorsuch summed up his minimalist judicial philosophy and focus on impartial judgment Tuesday evening. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch stands with his wife, Louise, as President Donald Trump introduces him in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31, 2017. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch stands with his wife, Louise, as President Donald Trump introduces him in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31, 2017. "A judge who reaches every outcome he wishes is likely a very bad judge," he said after Trump introduced him from the East Room of the White House in a primetime televised address. Lane, who frequently clashes with law enforcement, praised Gorsuch as fair and open-minded. Lane won a $1.8 million jury verdict against the Denver Police Department in a brutality and wrongful arrest case. The city appealed and the case ended up before Gorsuch. Lane said Gorsuch tore into the city's lawyers and urged them to go to mediation rather than drag out appeals for years to deny the plaintiffs their reward. The mediation led the case to be settled for $1.6 million. Gorsuch has also drawn attention for siding with religious employers against the Obama administration's requirement that they provide health insurance that covers contraception. He also wrote a book arguing against assisted suicide. Marcy Glenn, a Denver attorney and Democrat, recalls two cases before Gorsuch in which she represented underdogs. In one, a college student faced criminal libel charges for mocking a professor; the court upheld the student's right to file a claim against the prosecutor. In the second, homeowners sued over illnesses stemming from an old nuclear weapons facility outside Denver. Gorsuch revived their class-action lawsuit in a novelistic, 38-page ruling that began, "Harnessing nuclear energy is a delicate business." "He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy," Glenn said. Rebecca Love Kourlis, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice, said Gorsuch has written 175 majority opinions and 65 concurrences or dissents in his decade on the 10th Circuit. "He's really earned his stripes," she said. Kourlis said Gorsuch is also a notable advocate for simplifying the justice system to make it more accessible. "Legal services in this country are so expensive that the United States ranks near the bottom of developed nations when it comes to access to counsel in civil cases," Gorsuch wrote in a journal article last year. "The real question is what to do about it." President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. The article is written in Gorsuch's characteristic, straightforward style. "He thinks it's really important for people other than lawyers to understand what he's writing," Kourlis said. Gorsuch is also an avid skier, fly fisherman and horseback rider, Kourlis said. He teaches at the University of Colorado's law school in Boulder. "He is humble, he is extremely articulate and he is extraordinarily hard-working," Kourlis said. In his financial disclosure report for 2015, he reported assets ranging from $3.1 million to $7.25 million. He earned $26,000 for his law school duties and another $5,300 in book royalties that year.

President Donald Trump has chosen his first nominee, but it remains Justice Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court. The question is how much longer he wants it. Kennedy, 80 and celebrating his 29th year on the court this month, will remain the pivotal member of the court no matter how the warfare between Republicans and Democrats plays out. On almost every big social issue, neither the court's liberal, Democratic-appointed justices nor Kennedy's fellow Republican-appointed conservative colleagues can prevail without him. That is why an undercurrent of Trump's first choice for the court was whether it would soothe Kennedy, making him feel secure enough to retire and let this president choose the person who would succeed him. "Justice Kennedy tries not to play politics with these things," said one of Kennedy's former clerks, who watches the court carefully. Like others, he would not talk for attribution about his old boss. "But obviously he will feel more comfortable if the person who is picked is someone he likes and respects, just as the opposite would give him pause." Who better, then, to put Kennedy at ease than one of his former clerks? Kennedy trekked to Denver to swear in his protege Neil Gorsuch on the appeals court 10 years ago. If Gorsuch is confirmed to the Supreme Court, it would be the first time that a justice has served with a former clerk. Gorsuch on Tuesday evening praised the "incredibly welcoming and gracious" Kennedy, along with his other judicial mentors, the late Justice Byron White and Judge David Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. "These judges brought me up in the law," he said. "Truly I would not be here without them." Trump campaigned for office expertly on the Supreme Court, which is especially important to conservatives and evangelicals. He went so far as to say that even if voters did not like him, they had no choice but to support him because of the potential to shape the court for a generation. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83 and Justice Stephen Breyer is 78. They are two of the court's four liberals and are not likely to leave the court voluntarily while Trump is in charge. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. Some say Kennedy would be reluctant to leave, too, if it meant a more conservative court that would reverse some of his landmark decisions, especially on gay rights. But others who know him suggest he is ready to go. "I would put it at 50-50 that he leaves at the end of the term," said another former clerk. Kennedy recently hired clerks for the term that begins in October, but that is seen more as insurance than intent. The gentlemanly Kennedy could not be more different from the bombastic Trump, and so some involved in filling the current Supreme Court opening kept the justice in mind during the process. Pleasing Kennedy is wise but not dispositive, as lawyers at the court like to say. "I suppose he's more focused on the Trump administration as a whole," said another former clerk. "I think that will be more important to him than whether he likes this particular pick or not." All agree that it will not be Trump's first Supreme Court pick who will seal the court's ideological direction for a generation. It will be, if it happens, his second. Gorsuch, like almost anyone on Trump's list of 21 candidates to take Antonin Scalia's spot, is likely to replicate the late justice's voting pattern (if not his style). That would restore the court's long-held position as a generally conservative body capable of the occasional liberal surprise. President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come.

President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court... Those surprises are almost always supplied by Kennedy, nominated to the court by fellow Californian Ronald Reagan. Overall, Kennedy most often votes with the court's conservatives: He is further to the right on law-and-order issues than Scalia was, he is comfortable with the court's protective view of business, and he shared the losing view that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. But when the court moves left, it is because Kennedy joins its liberals - Ginsburg, Breyer, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. So Gorsuch's appointment would return the court to the status quo that existed before Scalia died. After that, the court's next appointment could mean a definitive shift. The Supreme Court without Breyer, Ginsburg or Kennedy would be a different place, indeed. They have been part of the scant majority that forbade the death penalty for minors and the intellectually disabled, and found established a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. When environmentalists win, which is becoming increasingly rare, it is because this group has banded together. Just last term, Kennedy and the liberals struck down a Texas law that they said used protecting women as a pretext for making abortion unavailable, and they continued a limited endorsement of affirmative action. Many if not all of those holdings would be at risk in a court with five consistent conservatives, the oldest being 68-year-old Justice Clarence Thomas. Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia.

Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George... Kennedy's role was especially important this past term. Before writing his opinion in the University of Texas affirmative-action case, Kennedy had never approved of a race-conscious program, although he had not been as willing as his colleagues to outlaw the use of race in such processes. And prior to striking down the Texas abortion law, he had disapproved of only one statute on the issue - requiring a woman to inform her husband of her decision to have the procedure - among dozens the court had reviewed. As had happened so many times before, Kennedy had the biggest impact on the most important cases. How long that continues is bigger than the current opening.

President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court nomination has the potential to do more than reshape the nation's judicial branch for years to come. It could end the Senate's long history as the world's greatest deliberative body. Liberal and conservative activists are girding for a fight that, under current rules, gives Democrats the power to block any court nomination. But in this week's environment, with Democrats delaying Cabinet nominations and both sides calling each other names largely unheard of in the history of the Senate's genteel discourse, Republicans could take steps to eliminate that power. If such a showdown occurs, it would be about more than ending Senate tradition of allowing an entrenched minority to stymie legislation and nominees through the filibuster. It would be about forever changing the nature of the Senate, which the founders set up with the express goal to slow down and cool off the hasty and heated impulses more common in the House. Trump made his pick public Tuesday night, announcing he'd chosen federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch. But long before then, some Democrats began signaling that they would attempt to filibuster the nominee, whoever it was. Looming large in their minds is the Republicans' strategy through much of 2016 to block President Barack Obama from filling the vacancy created after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told reporters Monday it was "a stolen seat" because former President Obama's choice, Judge Merrick Garland, never even got a hearing. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has even floated the idea of a permanent filibuster until the 2020 election. Later that afternoon, conservatives fired warning shots at five Democrats facing re-election in 2018 from states that Trump won by large margins. "So this leads to an interesting conundrum for Senators like Joe Donnelly," the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to Republican leaders, wrote about the Indiana Democrat. "Will he stand with the people of his state who overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump to be able to pick a Supreme Court nominee?" Trump has already suggested, in an interview with Fox News last week, that Republicans should blow up the filibuster with a rules change informally known as the "nuclear option" if Democrats successfully block his Supreme Court nominee. President Donald Trump has chosen his first nominee, but it remains Justice Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court. The question is how much longer he wants it.

President Donald Trump has chosen his first nominee, but it remains Justice Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court. The question is how much longer he wants it. Kennedy, 80 and celebrating his 29th year on the court this month, will remain the pivotal member of the court no matter how the warfare between... At the center of this power play sits Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the self-styled institutionalist who became brutally effective at using the filibuster and all Senate procedures to impede Obama's agenda. In his own telling, other senators only began to "know who I was" after his 1994 filibuster killing a campaign finance bill. "The experience was exhilarating," he wrote in his autobiography, "The Long Game," "and I was extremely proud to have used the rules of the Senate." McConnell comes from a long line of filibuster supporters who believe that the maneuver, which requires 60 votes to overcome (Republicans hold just 52 seats), forces a deliberative process that usually requires the majority to find votes from the other side of the aisle and makes for more stable, lasting laws forged with bipartisan consent. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, became a landmark law cherished by both parties when 27 Republicans joined 44 Democrats to thwart a filibuster by southern senators. But Harry Reid, D-Nev., McConnell's predecessor as majority leader, accused McConnell of being a hypocrite who claimed to cherish the Senate's traditions and procedures but whose own actions as minority leader abused those rules to shut down agencies and commissions. By filibustering so many nominees, a few of these government bodies lacked a quorum and were unable to fully function. After a string of such filibusters, Reid led a party-line effort in 2013 to change the Senate rules on some votes to require simple majorities rather than 60 votes. The change applied to presidential nominees - but not to the Supreme Court. Senate procedures allow formal rule changes only with a two-thirds super majority, but Reid invoked a parliamentary trick to get around that rule. Now, with Republicans controlling both chambers and Trump in the White House, McConnell is already facing pressure from conservatives to do the same thing - and wipe out the filibuster altogether. Some House Republicans brought up that possibility at the joint GOP retreat in Philadelphia last week. Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, has been on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. Here are summaries of some of his notable opinions: Gorsuch voted with a majority of the 10th Circuit in favor of privately held...

Here are summaries of some of his notable opinions: Gorsuch voted with a majority of the 10th Circuit in favor of privately held... McConnell returned from Philadelphia Friday and gave three interviews about the Supreme Court selection that produced three different headlines: "McConnell warns Trump to back off on killing filibuster"; "McConnell all but rules out filibuster change"; "McConnell guarantees Supreme Court confirmation". The one common thread was that McConnell guaranteed the Scalia vacancy would be filled - and that the means of filling it depended on how Democrats acted. "How that occurs will depend largely on how the other side handles it," he told Morning Consult. That's likely his way of saying that if Democrats intend to filibuster any nominee, regardless of qualifications, McConnell is willing to push his colleagues to change the rules. At the moment, he may not have the votes to make the move, which would require 50 of his 52 Republicans to support a maneuver that they were so hostile to just three years ago when Reid executed it. "I am not a proponent of changing the rules of the Senate. I hope that common sense will prevail and that we will have a normal process for considering this nominee," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters Monday evening. But there's very little that is normal about the process now. Thousands of liberal activists gathered outside the Supreme Court Monday night at a rally opposing Trump's executive order banning refugees from around the world and foreign nationals from seven majority-Muslim nations, urging Democratic lawmakers to fight him at every turn. The pressure on Democrats to filibuster any nominee to the high court will be tremendous. Even though 10 Democrats are up for reelection next year in states that Trump won in 2016, those Democrats know they need their own energized base to support their campaigns. Only one Democrat seems likely to support Trump's pick at this point, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a former governor who believes in strong executive authority and who comes from a state that Trump won by 42 percentage points. "I'm not a filibuster-type guy," Manchin said Monday. Some are considering delaying the bigger fight until the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy - usually the court's most key swing vote - but the momentum among activists is toward constant confrontation against all Trump appointees. Our Revolution, a PAC formed by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called on its supporters to demand Democrats force every hour of debate on every Cabinet nominee to slow up Trump's "reign of terror". That type of tactics could easily force McConnell into a decision he has been able to avoid since winning the majority in the 2014 midterm elections. "It was a huge, huge mistake in my view," he said then of the filibuster rules change. "It is hard to un-ring a bell. You know, they've now established a precedent. It's a big issue and a big discussion."

Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Wednesday that they intend to vote against the confirmation of President Donald Trump's education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos, giving Democrats two of at least three Republican votes they would need to block her appointment. Republican leaders said that despite the defections, they are confident DeVos will be confirmed. "She'll be confirmed - you can take that to the bank," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the majority whip. Both Collins and Murkowski said on the Senate floor that while they appreciate DeVos's efforts to help at-risk children through advocating for vouchers and charter schools, they are concerned that DeVos lacks the experience needed to serve as education secretary and improve public schools, particularly in rural areas. DeVos has no professional experience in public schools, and she did not attend public schools herself or send her own children to them. "The mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core," Collins said. "I'm concerned that Mrs. Devos's lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify and assist with those challenges, particularly for our rural schools in states like Maine." Murkowski said children in remote communities across Alaska depend on a strong public school system, and that she isn't persuaded that DeVos has the background to strengthen that system. As she left the Senate floor, Murkowski said that her decision was the result of an outpouring of responses from Alaskans as well as her own research. "I was trying to get to yes. I just couldn't," she said. A final confirmation vote is expected on the Senate floor either over the weekend or early next week, according to aides to Republican leadership. There are 48 senators in the Democratic caucus. If they vote as a bloc against DeVos, and if they are joined by Murkowski and Collins, the vote to confirm would be 50-50. In that event, Vice President Mike Pence - a staunch DeVos supporter - would cast the tiebreaking vote. It would mark the first tiebreaking vote by a vice president since Richard Cheney did so nine years ago. Joe Biden, Cheney's successor, went eight years as vice president without ever breaking a tie. If a third Republican senator votes against DeVos, she could lose the confirmation vote. Several are facing constituent pressure to oppose the nominee, including Patrick Toomey, R-Pa. "I'm all for her," Toomey told The Washington Post on Wednesday. Alaska's junior senator, Republican Dan Sullivan, would not say whether he will vote yes or no on DeVos. But his tone suggested he would lean toward support. He detailed concerns "similar to what Sen. Murkowski was talking about. We have very - almost frontier-type education environments where there's only one school in the communities. There's no choice at all." "But I've had very good meetings with the nominee," he added. "From my perspective I think she's going to be adequately focused on those issues." White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump administration has "zero" concerns that DeVos's nomination will be voted down. "I am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education," Spicer said at Wednesday's news briefing. Trump's nomination of DeVos, a Michigan billionaire and major donor to Republican causes, has triggered a sharp partisan battle, and she has faced an unprecedented level of opposition for a prospective education secretary. Both of the nation's largest teachers unions mounted campaigns against her immediately after her nomination, but opposition broadened after she stumbled over basic education policy questions during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing. Parents and teachers have flooded the Senate's phone lines and email inboxes in recent weeks, urging senators to vote against DeVos. "The nation is speaking out. . . . [S]enators need to listen," said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association. Several previous nominees were confirmed on a voice vote or by unanimous consent. The deepest division to date was over the nomination of John King , who was confirmed in March 2016 on a 49-40 vote. Even then, key Republicans - including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the majority leader - voted in King's favor, giving his confirmation a bipartisan blessing.

Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin defended his ties to offshore business entities and his management of a controversial California bank during a testy confirmation hearing on Thursday. Speaking before the Senate Finance committee, Mnuchin said businesses in the Cayman Islands and Anguilla revealed in his financial disclosures were not used for his personal benefit but served nonprofits and pensions. "In no way did I use [offshore entities] to avoid U.S. taxes," Mnuchin said. "I can assure you I pay all my taxes as was required." A memo compiled by Democratic committee staffers obtained by The Washington Post showed Mnuchin initially omitted some of those entities -- as well as more than $100 million in personal assets -- from his nomination paperwork. Mnuchin has revised the documents. According to the memo, Mnuchin submitted answers Dec. 19 to a standard committee questionnaire seeking information about his financial and business interests. At the time, Mnuchin verified that those responses were accurate and complete. Mnuchin at first failed to disclose his role as director of Dune Capital International, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, the document shows. He also holds positions in nine other business entities and three trusts, including one connected to Sears chief executive Edward Lampert, Mnuchin's former college roommate. According to the memo, Mnuchin characterized the missing information as inadvertent mistakes, and he updated his answers to the committee's questionnaire on Saturday. Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 19, 2017, to testify at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. Mnuchin built his reputation and his fortune as a savvy Wall Street investor, but critics charge that he profited from thousands of home foreclosures as the chief of a sub-prime mortgage lender during the housing collapse. Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 19, 2017, to testify at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. Mnuchin built his reputation and his fortune as a savvy Wall Street investor, but critics charge that he profited from thousands of home foreclosures as the chief of a sub-prime mortgage lender during the housing collapse. Mnuchin, a veteran Wall Street investor, has also come under fire for his 2009 purchase of failed subprime mortgage lender IndyMac from the federal government. Mnuchin renamed the bank OneWest and ran it for six years. During that time, he said, the bank modified over 100,000 of the country's most troubled loans and saved thousands of jobs in the process. "I have been maligned as taking advantage of others' hardships in order to earn a buck," Mnuchin told lawmakers Thursday. "Nothing could be further from the truth." Mnuchin purchased OneWest for $1.6 billion and sold the bank to CIT Group in 2015 for $3.4 billion The hearing began with a sharply combative tone before Mnuchin even began speaking -- an unusual departure for what is typically a staid and wonkish committee. Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, decried "stupid arguments" against Mnuchin's qualifications to manage the nation's finances and accused Democrats of obstructing President-elect Donald Trump's nominees. Ranking member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., shot back by accusing Mnuchin of using loopholes in international tax law to shield millions of dollars from taxation. Days after news surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump has selected former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, Mnuchin says he is stepping down from Sears Holdings' board of directors. The move is effective immediately, and reduces Sears Holdings' directors to nine,... Days after news surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump has selected former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, Mnuchin says he is stepping down from Sears Holdings' board of directors. The move is effective immediately, and reduces Sears Holdings' directors to nine,... Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, Kan., then interjected with a suggestion that Wyden take a Valium, an attempt at what he called a "pinprick" of levity. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, objected to the remark, forcing Hatch to gavel the committee to order. Mnuchin is one of several Cabinet nominees facing a rocky path to confirmation. Democrats have seized on the vast wealth amassed by Trump's advisers -- not just Mnuchin but also his picks to lead the Commerce, Education and State departments, among others -- as undermining the working-class support that fueled the president-elect's surprise victory. "The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities," Wyden said. "When I look at Mr. Mnuchin's background, it's a stretch to find evidence he'd be that kind of Treasury secretary." Mnuchin attended Yale University and began his career at Goldman Sachs, where his father was a senior partner, before leaving the legendary investment bank to form his own private equity fund, Dune Capital Management. After purchasing IndyMac, Mnuchin became a Hollywood financier, backing well-known films such as "Avatar." He has not previously served in government. At several points during his hearing, Mnuchin appeared stung by the sharp questioning from lawmakers. During an exchange with Brown over his role in homeowner foreclosures, Mnuchin pushed back at the senator. "If you know [the answer], why did you ask me?" Mnuchin said. "It seems to me with all due respect that you just want to shoot questions at me." One of Mnuchin's most controversial - and profitable - investments was his purchase of IndyMac during the depths of the financial crisis. At the time, many investors were wary of the complicated securities at the center of the housing bust, but Mnuchin said he saw a way to save the ailing bank, though it had little ability to stray from government guidelines in deciding when to foreclose. He noted that at one point, the bank sued HSBC for the ability to modify loans in trusts that it controlled. Mnuchin's spokeswoman has said that 178,000 homes were already in foreclosure when Mnuchin took over the bank. On Thursday, Mnuchin said one of the "most troubling" cases involved Nadya Denise Suleman, the California mother of octuplets who became known as the "Octomom." Mnuchin's bank foreclosed on her home in 2012, according to news reports. "The responsibility landed on me to clean up the mess that we inherited," Mnuchin said. He also faced scrutiny of his complex business interests. According to the memo from Democratic staff, Mnuchin initially failed to disclose his homes in New York City, Southampton, N.Y., and Los Angeles, as well as $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico. Also missing was $906,556 worth of artwork held by his children. On Thursday, Wyden accused Mnuchin of using loopholes in international tax law to shield millions of dollars from taxation. "I'm very troubled about this question of how you're going to un-rig the system if you've got a record of taking advantage of tax shelters," Wyden said. Mnuchin made few forays into policy during his hearing, though he did provide details of the border tax that Trump has threatened to impose on U.S. companies that offshore operations and then sell products back home. Mnuchin said the tax would be narrowly targeted at such businesses, not broadly levied on all imports. Trump has singled out Ford and General Motors as potentially facing those penalties. The president-elect "has not suggested in any way an across-the-board 35 percent border tax," Mnuchin said. Just a few weeks ago, however, Trump appeared to suggest just that. In an interview with the New York Times, Trump said he "would tax China on products coming in." On the campaign trail, Trump called for a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports and a 45 percent tariff on goods from China. Mnuchin helped craft Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code and is expected to have a significant role in pushing the plan through Congress. The current proposal would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and streamline individual tax brackets. An analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation estimated the reductions would cost at least $2.6 trillion over a decade, even after accounting for faster economic growth. But Mnuchin pledged Thursday that Trump's tax plan would be fully paid for. He said that lowering taxes and reducing regulation, among other steps, would boost economic growth to between 3 percent and 4 percent. There is a heated debate among analysts over whether that forecast is too optimistic and whether it would offset the cost of tax reform. "With the appropriate growth, we want to make sure that tax reform doesn't increase the size of the deficit," Mnuchin said. Mnuchin also called for reform of the housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders and then package them into securities to sell to investors. They have been under government control since 2008, but over the last few years Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been returning billions of dollars to federal coffers. That has roiled shareholders, who are suing to have the arrangement overturned as efforts to resolve the firms' status have languished. On Thursday, Mnuchin said he wanted to reform the companies but did not support simply releasing them from government control and allowing them to recapitalize -- an approach that has been favored by many investors, particularly some Wall Street hedge funds. "We shouldn't just leave Fannie and Freddie as is for the next four or eight years under government control without a fix," Mnuchin said. "I believe we can find a bipartisan fix for these." Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dove more than 10 percent after Mnuchin's comments. Mnuchin also said he did not advocate a return to Glass Steagall, a law stemming from the Depression that separated commercial and investment banking. Instead, he advocated a "21st century Glass Steagall" -- a rare point of agreement with critics such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who tweeted his support for the measure on Thursday. The Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.

The U.S. Senate headed for its most heated Supreme Court confirmation hearings in more than a decade on Tuesday, with both parties facing intense pressure to prevail in one of the defining political battles of President Donald Trump's nascent term. Neil Gorsuch, Trump's pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the high court, is poised to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Republicans are hoping to confirm the nomination by early April before a two-week Easter recess, allowing Gorsuch to participate in the final cases of the court's term ending in June. But in a sign that Democrats were immediately ramping up resistance, Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and several colleagues declared that Gorsuch would need to earn at least 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles to earn a final confirmation vote. Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate. "The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the Executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans," Schumer said. "Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch's ability to meet this standard." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer discusses President Donald Trump's immigration order on Jan. 31, 2017, at the U.S. Capitol. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer discusses President Donald Trump's immigration order on Jan. 31, 2017, at the U.S. Capitol. That will put pressure on Republicans, who have been agonizing over whether to change longstanding Senate rules to break Democratic resistance - and who are already feeling the heat from supporters yearning to add a conservative voice to the court for the first time since the George W. Bush administration. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he hopes senators will give Gorsuch "fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four first-term nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama." In a separate video message, McConnell gushed about Gorsuch: "The president made an outstanding choice." Just 31 current senators were in office in July 2006 when Gorsuch was confirmed without opposition to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over all or parts of eight western states. This time around, Gorsuch will be shepherded across Capitol Hill by former senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a moderate Republican who lost reelection in November and will helm a team of veteran GOP political operatives overseeing the months-long confirmation fight. Gorsuch's fate rests especially with Democrats including Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.), who suggested in recent days that he would try to mount a filibuster as payback to Republicans who blocked former president Barack Obama's final Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost the entirety of 2016. "This is a stolen seat," Merkley said in a statement Tuesday night. Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling... Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling... Other Democrats said their consideration of Gorsuch will now be tied to Trump's executive order temporarily barring U.S. entry for foreign nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries and for refugees worldwide - and his decision to fire the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, for refusing to defend the order in court. "In light of the unconstitutional actions of our new President in just his first week, the Senate owes the American people a thorough and unsparing examination of this nomination," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a senior member of the Judiciary Committee that will consider Gorsuch's nomination. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., another member of the panel, added that he had "deep, serious concerns" about Gorsuch. "If I conclude that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream, then I will pursue every legal tool available to block his nomination," Blumenthal said. By threatening to filibuster, Democrats could be laying the tripwire for Republicans to get rid of it entirely. Just a few years ago, it was Democrats who ended the ability to filibuster presidential appointments - with the crucial exception of Supreme Court nominees. If Merkley and other Democrats follow through on their threat, Republicans will not even have the support to bring up Gorsuch's name for a vote. It would be just the second time in modern history that a Supreme Court nominee has been filibustered. President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court...

At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court... That very plausible situation will leave Republicans with two unenviable decisions: Give up on getting Trump's pick through - or get rid of the filibuster so that a simple majority can approve the nominee. That could pit McConnell's devotion to Senate customs and tradition against conservatives eager to see one of their ideological peers win a high court seat. "You change the rules of the Senate, you are doing something pretty draconian," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Tuesday afternoon. McConnell could also find himself in Trump's crosshairs, a fate he has avoided thus far, unlike his House counterpart, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The president has said he supports changing the rules to avert a filibuster - a maneuver that is known on Capitol Hill as "the nuclear option" - if Democrats stand firm in resistance. Some Democrats said they would frame their opposition to Gorsuch as more considered than Republican opposition to Garland. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative nonprofit serving as an outside ally to McConnell's leadership team, launched a $2 million ad campaign in four states that Trump won where Democratic senators face reelection: North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Montana. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, said her group is targeting those senators because they see them as some of the most likely to join Republicans in confirming Gorsuch. She said the organization plans to defend Gorsuch and also warn Democrats against joining a campaign of "obstructionism." "Those senators are going to have a tough choice before them," she said. Progressive groups including Democracy for America, meanwhile, demanded "total opposition to all of Trump's appointees," including Gorsuch, until Trump rescinds his travel ban. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, warned Democrats on Tuesday not to relent. "The only reason that Trump can name this Supreme Court justice is because of the unconscionable actions by Senate Republicans in refusing to even hold a hearing" for Garland, the group said in a memo to senators. "Rewarding such behavior by confirming a radical nominee should not even be an option for Democrats." The back-and-forth will put immediate political pressure on dozens of vulnerable Democrats including Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.). A close ally of Schumer, Tester said he does not agree with the dogmatic standard that Merkley and others are imposing to block any Trump nominee. Tester said he is willing to vote for the nominee if they meet his credentials: "Somebody that knows real America and somebody that knows the Constitution and somebody that knows the gravity of the position - like Merrick Garland," he said. "I'll see who he nominates and then we'll do our due diligence," Tester said. Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W. Va., who represents a state Trump won by more than 40 points, urged his Democratic colleagues "to put partisan process aside and allow the process to proceed."

Manchin and Tester are part of the class of 25 Democrats up for reelection in 2018, 10 of whom come from states that Trump won.

"A guy who's been a three-day drunk could figure out this guy is one of the most qualified people ever to be at the circuit level....If we blow up the Senate over a man like this, it really would be a shame," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., an occasional Trump critic. Democrats had been invited by Trump to attend the White House announcement, but they declined since they were unaware of who the selection would be. Sen. Richard Durbin (Ill.), the Democratic whip, compared the situation to a reality TV show. "Tonight seemed like an awkward situation, to walk into a room and they pull the curtain back and say, 'Here's your next Supreme Court nominee, now what are you going to do next?" he said.

Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George W. Bush's Justice Department before being appointed to the federal bench and authoring a series of sharply written, conservative opinions. His mother, Anne, ran President Ronald Reagan's Environmental Protection Agency. But Gorsuch has also won praise among liberals and others in the Colorado legal community for his fair-mindedness and defense of the underdog. "He is a very, very smart man. His leanings are very conservative, but he's qualified to be on the Supreme Court," said Denver plaintiff's attorney David Lane. "I don't know that Judge Gorsuch has a political agenda and he is sincere and honest and believes what he writes."

At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court... A judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Gorsuch lives in the hyper-liberal college town of Boulder and teaches at the University of Colorado's law school there, also a progressive bastion. "I think this should be Merrick Garland's seat," said Jordan Henry, one of Gorsuch's students there and a self-described liberal, referring to President Obama's nominee for the vacancy last year who was never considered by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. But she described Gorsuch as an eager mentor, always solicitous of students' opinions and with a brilliant mind. "He's dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the justice system," said Henry, 29. "I do take some comfort that he can be a Trump choice." Gorsuch is a Colorado native who earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in three years, then earned a law degree from Harvard. He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White, a fellow Coloradan, and Anthony Kennedy before earning a philosophy degree at Oxford University and working for a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm. He served for two years in Bush's Justice Department before Bush appointed him to a seat on the 10th Circuit in 2006. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, served as administrator of the EPA, but she was forced to resign 1983 amid a scandal involving the mismanagement of a $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps. Burford was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over Superfund records, which she claimed were protected by executive privilege. Neil Gorsuch has contended that courts give too much deference to government agencies' interpretations of statutes, a deference that stems from a Supreme Court ruling in a 1984 case. More recently, he sided with two groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements that employers provide health insurance that includes contraception. Gorsuch summed up his minimalist judicial philosophy and focus on impartial judgment Tuesday evening. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch stands with his wife, Louise, as President Donald Trump introduces him in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31, 2017. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch stands with his wife, Louise, as President Donald Trump introduces him in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31, 2017. "A judge who reaches every outcome he wishes is likely a very bad judge," he said after Trump introduced him from the East Room of the White House in a primetime televised address. Lane, who frequently clashes with law enforcement, praised Gorsuch as fair and open-minded. Lane won a $1.8 million jury verdict against the Denver Police Department in a brutality and wrongful arrest case. The city appealed and the case ended up before Gorsuch. Lane said Gorsuch tore into the city's lawyers and urged them to go to mediation rather than drag out appeals for years to deny the plaintiffs their reward. The mediation led the case to be settled for $1.6 million. Gorsuch has also drawn attention for siding with religious employers against the Obama administration's requirement that they provide health insurance that covers contraception. He also wrote a book arguing against assisted suicide. Marcy Glenn, a Denver attorney and Democrat, recalls two cases before Gorsuch in which she represented underdogs. In one, a college student faced criminal libel charges for mocking a professor; the court upheld the student's right to file a claim against the prosecutor. In the second, homeowners sued over illnesses stemming from an old nuclear weapons facility outside Denver. Gorsuch revived their class-action lawsuit in a novelistic, 38-page ruling that began, "Harnessing nuclear energy is a delicate business." "He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy," Glenn said. Rebecca Love Kourlis, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice, said Gorsuch has written 175 majority opinions and 65 concurrences or dissents in his decade on the 10th Circuit. "He's really earned his stripes," she said. Kourlis said Gorsuch is also a notable advocate for simplifying the justice system to make it more accessible. "Legal services in this country are so expensive that the United States ranks near the bottom of developed nations when it comes to access to counsel in civil cases," Gorsuch wrote in a journal article last year. "The real question is what to do about it." President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia.

The article is written in Gorsuch's characteristic, straightforward style. "He thinks it's really important for people other than lawyers to understand what he's writing," Kourlis said. Gorsuch is also an avid skier, fly fisherman and horseback rider, Kourlis said. He teaches at the University of Colorado's law school in Boulder. "He is humble, he is extremely articulate and he is extraordinarily hard-working," Kourlis said. In his financial disclosure report for 2015, he reported assets ranging from $3.1 million to $7.25 million. He earned $26,000 for his law school duties and another $5,300 in book royalties that year.

Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, has been on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. Here are summaries of some of his notable opinions: Gorsuch voted with a majority of the 10th Circuit in favor of privately held for-profit secular corporations, and individuals who owned or controlled them, who raised religious objections to paying for contraception for women covered under their health plans. Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion in which he explained the moral dilemma facing the family that owns Hobby Lobby. "As they understand it, ordering their companies to provide insurance coverage for drugs or devices whose use is inconsistent with their faith itself violates their faith, representing a degree of complicity their religion disallows... No doubt, the Greens' religious convictions are contestable. Some may even find the Greens' beliefs offensive. But no one disputes that they are sincerely held religious beliefs," he wrote. Gorsuch was on the losing end of a vote by the full 10th Circuit over whether to rehear the case of a man who was convicted of having a gun after having earlier been convicted of a serious crime. The issue was whether the defendant knew that his earlier conviction was for a crime that disqualified him from owning a gun. Gorsuch argued in favor of a new hearing. "None of these arguments compels us to perpetuate the injustice of disregarding the plain terms of the law Congress wrote and denying defendants the day in court that law promises them." In this 2016 case, Gorsuch wrote for a panel of judges who sided with a Mexican citizen who was seeking permission to live in the U.S. The case gave Gorsuch an opportunity to raise an issue he has championed in his time as a judge: whether courts should so readily defer to federal agencies in determining what laws and regulations mean. Referring to high-court cases that Gorsuch believes cede too much power to agencies, he wrote: "There's an elephant in the room with us today. We have studiously attempted to work our way around it and even left it unremarked. But the fact is Chevron and Brand X permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth." Associated Press

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions fervently rejected "damnably false" accusations of past racist comments Tuesday as he challenged Democratic concerns about the civil rights commitment he would bring as Donald Trump's attorney general. He vowed at his confirmation hearing to stay independent from the White House and stand up to Trump when necessary. Sessions laid out a sharply conservative vision for the Justice Department he would oversee, pledging to crack down on illegal immigration, gun violence and the "scourge of radical Islamic terrorism" and to keep open the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. But he also distanced himself from some of Trump's public pronouncements. He said waterboarding, a now-banned harsh interrogation technique that Trump has at times expressed support for, was "absolutely improper and illegal." Though he said he would prosecute immigrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally and criticized as constitutionally "questionable" an executive action by President Barack Obama that shielded certain immigrants from deportation, he said he did "not support the idea that Muslims, as a religious group, should be denied admission to the United States." Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., cast himself as a strong protector of law and order at his confirmation hearing Jan. 10, 2017, promising that as attorney general he would crack down on illegal immigration, gun violence and the "scourge of radical Islamic terrorism." Trump earlier in his campaign called for a temporary total ban on Muslims entering his country but has more recently proposed "extreme vetting." Sessions asserted that he could confront Trump if needed, saying an attorney general must be prepared to resign if asked to do something "unlawful or unconstitutional." Nothing new came out of the hearing that seemed likely to threaten Sessions' confirmation by the Republican Senate. Yet as he outlined his priorities, his past — including a 1986 judicial nomination that failed amid allegations that he'd made racially charged comments — hovered over the proceedings. Protesters calling Sessions a racist repeatedly interrupted and were hustled out by Capitol police. Sessions vigorously denied that he had ever called the NAACP "un-American." He said he had never harbored racial animus, calling the allegations — which included that he had referred to a black attorney in his office as "boy" — part of a false caricature. "It wasn't accurate then," Sessions said. "It isn't accurate now." He said he "understands the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters. I have witnessed it." Several NAACP protesters led by their national president were escorted away in handcuffs by police after staging a sit-in Tuesday at the Alabama office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for U.S. attorney general, the civil rights group said. The organization held the demonstration to protest Sessions'... Several NAACP protesters led by their national president were escorted away in handcuffs by police after staging a sit-in Tuesday at the Alabama office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for U.S. attorney general, the civil rights group said. The organization held the demonstration to protest Sessions'... "I know we need to do better. We can never go back," Sessions said. "I am totally committed to maintaining the freedom and equality that this country has to provide to every citizen." Politics got its share of attention, too, with Sessions promising to recuse himself from any investigation there might be into Democrat Hillary Clinton, whom he had criticized during the presidential campaign. Trump said during the campaign he would name a special prosecutor to look into Clinton's use of a private email server, but he has since backed away. The FBI and Justice Department declined to bring charges last year. Sessions, known as one of the most staunchly conservative members of the Senate, smiled amiably as he began his presentation, taking time to introduce his grandchildren, joking about Alabama football and making self-deprecating remarks about his strong Southern accent. He has solid support from the Senate's Republican majority and from some Democrats in conservative-leaning states. But he faces a challenge persuading skeptical Democrats that he'll be fair and committed to civil rights, a chief priority of the Justice Department during the Obama administration, as the country's top law enforcement official. A group of more than 1,100 law school professors from across the country is sending a letter to Congress Tuesday urging the Senate to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general. The letter, signed by law professors from 170 law schools in 48 states, is also scheduled... A group of more than 1,100 law school professors from across the country is sending a letter to Congress Tuesday urging the Senate to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general. The letter, signed by law professors from 170 law schools in 48 states, is also scheduled... Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked whether he could be trusted to enforce the laws he has voted against, including expanded hate crime protections. He said he could, noting that he accepted the Roe v. Wade opinion on abortion as the law of the land even though he personally opposed it. Feinstein said, "There is so much fear in this country. I see it, I hear it — particularly in the African-American community, from preachers, from politicians, from everyday Americans." If confirmed, Sessions would succeed Attorney General Loretta Lynch and would be in a position to reshape Justice Department priorities not only in civil rights but also environmental enforcement, criminal justice and national security. He said he supported continued use of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for terror suspects, a sharp departure from an Obama administration that has supported prosecuting militants in American courts. And he hinted he'd be less eager than Obama's Justice Department to prod city police departments into court-enforceable improvement plans, known as consent decrees, to resolve allegations of pervasive civil rights violations. He said he did not consider it fair to criticize an entire department for what might be the actions of just a few. "We need to be sure that when we criticize law officers, it is narrowly focused on the right basis for criticism," he said, adding that "to smear whole departments places those officers at greater risk." Sessions was first elected to the Senate in 1996 and before that served as Alabama attorney general and a U.S. attorney. He's been a reliably conservative voice in Congress, supporting government surveillance programs and opposing a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill that included a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. In a dramatic turn, Senate colleague Cory Booker of New Jersey — one of three black senators — is to testify against Sessions on Wednesday. Booker's office says that will be an unprecedented instance of a senator testifying against a colleague seeking a Cabinet post. In a statement, Booker accused Sessions of having a "concerning" record on civil rights and criminal justice reform. Associated Press

Rex Tillerson's bid to be secretary of state narrowly won approval Monday from the Republican-led Foreign Relations Committee, a move that all but assures Senate confirmation of President Donald Trump's choice to be the nation's top diplomat. Members of the committee voted along party lines, 11-10, to back Tillerson following a contentious confirmation hearing nearly two weeks ago that stoked concerns he might not win the panel's recommendation. But just hours before members cast their votes, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., declared his support for Tillerson, backing off from a challenge to the new president. Rubio said that despite serious reservations about Tillerson, particularly over his views on Russia, he believed a president was entitled to significant deference in assembling his Cabinet. None of the committee's 10 Democrats voted for Tillerson. They cited concerns Tillerson would continue to view the world through the lens of a corporate executive and not the nation's chief diplomat. Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the panel's top Democrat, said Tillerson "equivocated" during his confirmation hearing on questions about human rights, civil society and press and religious freedoms, and repeatedly prioritized "narrow business interests ahead of these core national security interests." Every nominee for the job going back at least four decades has been approved by overwhelming votes from both sides in the Foreign Relations Committee, as senators have traditionally wanted to deliver a bipartisan display of confidence to the nation's top diplomat. No other nominee since 1977 has received more than two "no" votes from the committee. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee's Republican chairman, said he has "no doubt" Tillerson is well-qualified, citing his leadership of the energy giant. Corker chided his colleagues who had demanded information about Tillerson's personal taxes, saying the material had been used to ask "silly, silly questions." Rubio announced he would vote for Tillerson in a statement posted on Facebook. "Despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson's nomination in committee and in the full Senate," said Rubio, who'd come under strong pressure from fellow Republicans to back the nomination and avoid dealing Trump an embarrassing setback in the early days of his presidency. Rubio had clashed with Tillerson at a committee hearing earlier this month, bridling at his refusal to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and his failure to condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He chided Tillerson over the need for "moral clarity." But in the end, after unsuccessfully opposing Trump for the GOP nomination last year before coming around to support him, Rubio decided to fall in line this time, too. His statement came after the nomination got a boost on Sunday from two influential Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also offered tepid endorsements for Tillerson. Like Rubio, McCain and Graham had voiced concerns in light of Tillerson's long history of personal dealings with Putin, his record of doing oil deals in Russia and his questioning of the U.S. sanctions on that country. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he was encouraged by several of Tillerson's public stances, including "his clear-eyed understanding of the threat posed by Putin's Russia" and his commitment to NATO. But Coons said the differences on key issues between himself and Tillerson two outweighed the similarities. "I believe that climate change is a pressing national security threat," Coons said. "I believe that advocating for human rights, a free press, and democracy around the world advances our own security and economic interests here at home." Further roiling the debate is U.S. intelligence's assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Even while announcing his support for Tillerson, Rubio laid out a series of concerns in his statement Monday. "Despite his extensive experience in Russia and his personal relationship with many of its leaders, he claimed he did not have sufficient information to determine whether Putin and his cronies were responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists and political opponents," Rubio said of Tillerson. "He indicated he would support sanctions on Putin for meddling in our elections only if they met the impossible condition that they not affect U.S. businesses operating in Russia." Associated Press

It should have been one of the most congenial calls for the new commander in chief - a conversation with the leader of Australia, one of America's staunchest allies, at the end of a triumphant week. Instead, President Donald Trump blasted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee agreement and boasted about the magnitude of his electoral college win, according to senior U.S. officials briefed on the Saturday exchange. Then, 25 minutes into what was expected to be an hour-long call, Trump abruptly ended it. At one point, Trump informed Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day - including Russian President Vladimir Putin - and that "this was the worst call by far." Trump's behavior suggests that he is capable of subjecting world leaders, including close allies, to a version of the vitriol he frequently employs against political adversaries and news organizations in speeches and on Twitter. "This is the worst deal ever," Trump fumed as Turnbull attempted to confirm that the United States would honor its pledge to take in 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Trump, who one day earlier had signed an executive order temporarily barring the admission of refugees, complained that he was "going to get killed" politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the "next Boston bombers." Trump returned to the topic late Wednesday night, writing in a message on Twitter: "Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!" U.S. officials said that Trump has behaved similarly in conversations with leaders of other countries, including Mexico. But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia - countries that share intelligence, support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The characterizations provide insight into Trump's temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation's chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. The depictions of Trump's calls are also at odds with sanitized White House accounts. The official readout of his conversation with Turnbull, for example, said that the two had "emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally." A White House spokesman declined to comment. A senior administration official acknowledged that the conversation with Turnbull had been hostile and charged, but emphasized that most of Trump's calls with foreign leaders - including the heads of Japan, Germany, France and Russia - have been productive and pleasant. Trump also vented anger and touted his political accomplishments in a tense conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, officials said. The two have sparred for months over Trump's vow to force Mexico to pay for construction of a border wall between the two countries, a conflict that prompted Peña Nieto to cancel a planned meeting with Trump. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Jan. 30, 2017. Even in conversations marred by hostile exchanges, Trump manages to work in references to his election accomplishments. U.S. officials said that he used his calls with Turnbull and Peña Nieto to mention his election win or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. One official said that it may be Trump's way of "speaking about the mandate he has and why he has the backing for decisions he makes." But Trump is also notoriously thin-skinned and has used platforms including social-media accounts, meetings with lawmakers and even a speech at CIA headquarters to depict his victory as an achievement of historic proportions, rather than a narrow outcome in which his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote. The friction with Turnbull reflected Trump's anger over being bound by an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian detention sites even while Trump was issuing an executive order suspending such arrivals from elsewhere in the world. The issue centers on a population of about 2,500 people who sought asylum in Australia but were diverted to facilities off that country's coast at Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Deplorable conditions at those sites prompted intervention from the United Nations and a pledge from the United States to accept about half of those refugees, provided they passed U.S. security screening. Many of the refugees came from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, countries listed in Trump's order temporarily barring their citizens from entry to the United States. A special provision in the Trump order allows for exceptions to honor "a preexisting international agreement," a line that was inserted to cover the Australia deal. But U.S. officials said that Trump continued to fume about the arrangement even after signing the order in a ceremony at the Pentagon. President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump's remarks came at the top of what was... President Donald Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark African American History Month, calling CNN "fake news" and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump's remarks came at the top of what was... "I don't want these people," Trump said. He repeatedly misstated the number of refugees called for in the agreement as 2,000 rather than 1,250, and told Turnbull that it was "my intention" to honor the agreement, a phrase designed to leave the U.S. president wiggle room to back out of the deal in the future, according to a senior U.S. official. Before Trump tweeted about the agreement Wednesday night, the U.S. Embassy in Canberra had assured Australian reporters that the new administration intended to take the refugees. "President Trump's decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed," an embassy spokesman had told the reporters, according to an official in the Sydney consulate. "This was just reconfirmed to the State Department from the White House and on to this embassy at 1315 Canberra time." The time the embassy said it was informed the deal was going ahead was 9:15 p.m. in Washington, one hour and 40 minutes before Trump suggested in a tweet that it might not go ahead. During the phone conversation Saturday, Turnbull told Trump that to honor the agreement, the United States would not have to accept all of the refugees but only to allow each through the normal vetting procedures. At that, Trump vowed to subject each refugee to "extreme vetting," the senior U.S. official said. Trump was also skeptical because he did not see a specific advantage the United States would gain by honoring the deal, officials said. Trump's position appears to reflect the transactional view he takes of relationships, even when it comes to diplomatic ties with long-standing allies. Australian troops have fought alongside U.S. forces for decades, and the country maintains close cooperation with Washington on trade and economic issues. Australia is seen as such a trusted ally that it is one of only four countries that the United States includes in the "Five Eyes" arrangement for cooperation on espionage matters. Members share extensively what their intelligence services gather and generally refrain from spying on one another. There also is a significant amount of tourism between the two countries. Trump made the call to Turnbull about 5 p.m. Saturday from his desk in the Oval Office, where he was joined by chief strategist Stephen Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. At one point, Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues. But Trump demurred and ended the call, making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan, Angela Merkel of Germany, François Hollande of France or Putin. "These conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately," Turnbull said at a news conference Thursday in Australia. "If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them." A.

The child exploitation conspiracy theory that apparently inspired a North Carolina man to show up in Washington, D.C., this week with an assault rifle ranks among the most insidious fabrications to have spread online during the presidential campaign. But it has at least two prominent backers on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team: designated national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and his son Michael G. Flynn. The retired three-star U.S. Army general and his 33-year-old son - who serves as his father's chief of staff - have used their social media accounts to promote numerous baseless claims, including that members of Hillary Clinton's campaign were implicated in a child prostitution ring. The Flynns' involvement in spreading this toxic allegation seemed mainly to serve as a disheartening example of the public's susceptibility to manipulation in the digital age, until a gunman arrived in Northwest Washington on Sunday carrying an assault weapon and, according to authorities, planning to investigate the fictitious crime. The gunman was arrested, but not before he had fired at least one round, caused panic at a pizza restaurant that had the misfortune of being linked to the anti-Clinton conspiracy allegation, and caused a busy stretch of Connecticut Avenue to be cordoned off by police. The elder Flynn, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before he was pushed out by the Obama administration in 2014, called attention to the phony story just days before the election last month with a breathless posting on Twitter: "U decide - NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc . . . MUST READ!" For 45 minutes, police said, Edgar Maddison Welch, cradling an AR-15 assault-style rifle, roamed the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant looking to prove an Internet conspiracy theory that the popular Washington, D.C., restaurant harbored juvenile sex slaves. The few patrons had fled before Welch... For 45 minutes, police said, Edgar Maddison Welch, cradling an AR-15 assault-style rifle, roamed the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant looking to prove an Internet conspiracy theory that the popular Washington, D.C., restaurant harbored juvenile sex slaves. The few patrons had fled before Welch... Hours after the gunman was apprehended, the younger Flynn renewed his support for the lie. "Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story," Michael G. Flynn said on Twitter late Sunday evening. "The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it." Flynn's tweet appeared to be a reference to unfounded allegations spread online that the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington served as a front for human trafficking and sex crimes, and that hacked Clinton emails were riddled with coded references to kidnapping, molestation and child prostitution. The elder Flynn did not make the connection to the restaurant, though he has also never backed away from the claim that the Clintons were linked to a child sex ring. Neither Flynn responded to requests for comment Monday. As designated national security adviser, the senior Flynn is poised to be among the most influential occupants of the Trump White House. His son has appeared in photos with his father greeting other senior national security applicants at Trump Tower - where Trump and his transition team are based. The younger Flynn has no national security of significant government experience. One family associate said that Michael G. Flynn's prior work experience included a stint working for an uncle's printing company in California. A North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after he walked into a popular pizza restaurant in northwest Washington carrying an assault rifle and fired one or more shots, D.C. police said. The man told police he had come to the restaurant to "self-investigate" a false election-related conspiracy theory... A North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after he walked into a popular pizza restaurant in northwest Washington carrying an assault rifle and fired one or more shots, D.C. police said. The man told police he had come to the restaurant to "self-investigate" a false election-related conspiracy theory... The two were often separated during the elder Flynn's military career, which included long deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. The father even missed his son's wedding while overseas. But the two have been largely inseparable since Flynn left the military and echoed each other's strident postings online. When the older Flynn launched an intelligence consulting firm, he gave his son a job as chief of staff. The son traveled with his father to Moscow last year, according to family associates, where his father was seated beside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala thrown by RT, the Kremlin-controlled propaganda news outlet. The older Flynn has gone largely quiet on social media since the election, but his son remains an active online presence. His Facebook account was updated Monday with a fresh link to a broadcast by right-wing provocateur Alex Jones. Previous postings include a digitally manipulated image of Trump surrounded by handguns aimed at his head. The weapons are marked labeled with brands of major news organizations, including CBS, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Neither Flynn appears to have been involved in the initial fabrication of the Clinton email claims. But both amplified the falsehood online as part of a broad stream of dubious postings and claims. Multiple organizations with alt-right affiliations have spread stories accusing the Clintons of being tied to cases of human trafficking and sex crimes. One involves Comet Ping Pong, and another involves billionaire donor and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's ties to the Clintons. After leaving office, Bill Clinton was occasionally a passenger on aircraft owned by Epstein, who was also a regular visitor to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The initial tweet by the older Flynn linked to an article from the far-right website True Pundit that points to the Epstein case. Comet Ping Pong is not mentioned by True Pundit - either explicitly or implicitly. And in fact, the Reddit posting that spawned what's come to be known as "PizzaGate" (the thread has been taken down by Reddit) is from Nov. 4, according to Snopes - two days after the True Pundit article posted Nov. 2. Both Flynns have trafficked in these kinds of bogus stories many times before. The son has also pushed a conspiracy theory that Sen. Marco Rubio was a closeted homosexual who abused cocaine, and promoted baseless accounts that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Washington Post's Aaron Blake and Julie Tate contributed to this report.

Moscow, we have a problem. Web surfers expecting to tune into C-SPAN's online feed of debate in the House on Thursday instead saw images supplied by the Russian news site RT, which briefly interrupted programming on the network's website. Spokesman Howard Mortman said the website, www.c-span.org, was replaced by RT for about 10 minutes. The problem was likely a routing issue, since RT is one of the networks that C-SPAN regularly monitors, he said. The network is "investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence," Mortman said. The network later said it doesn't believe it was hacked. The programming glitch came hours after a power outage interrupted a Senate confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., to head the CIA. The hearing reconvened in a different room. The Architect of the Capitol's office said a local power company "de-energized" a system that feeds power to the Hart Senate Office Building. The office said the power company, Pepco, quickly restored the lost power. The architect's office said it is examining the surge-breaker that was unexpectedly affected by the planned Pepco work. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., later said she found it curious that she had just begun criticizing a Republican bill she contended would damage the regulatory authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission when the RT programming broke in. She also was criticizing President-elect Donald Trump for choosing someone with deep ties to Wall Street to lead the SEC. "Placed in the context of current events concerning cyberattacks and foreign interference in our elections, it is very important that C-SPAN provide a clear and concise explanation for the interruption of its online broadcast before we can reach any conclusions or establish the basis for additional inquiry," Waters said in a statement.

In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law and insisted anew that Mexico will pay the cost of a border wall. The hour-long spectacle in the marbled lobby of Trump's Manhattan skyscraper was his first news conference since winning the election in early November, and the famously unconventional politician demonstrated he had not been changed by the weight of his victory. He defiantly denied reports that Russia had collected compromising personal and financial information about him, lambasting the media for peddling "fake news" and shouting down a journalist from CNN, which reported on the matter. His family and advisers clapped and cheered him on throughout. President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here's a guide to 15 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. - "It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because... President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here's a guide to 15 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. - "It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because... Trump's transition has been shadowed by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia not only meddled in the election, but did so to help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. After spending weeks challenging that idea, Trump finally accepted at least part of the intelligence conclusions. "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia," Trump said, quickly adding that "other countries and other people" also hack U.S. interests. Still, he kept needling the intelligence agencies, saying it would be a "tremendous blot" on their record if officials were leaking information from his classified briefings. One U.S. official told The Associated Press Tuesday night that intelligence people had informed Trump last week about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him. Some media outlets reported on the document, which contains unproven information alleging close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians, as well as unverified claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump. The AP has not authenticated any of the claims. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said later Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump about the dossier and told him the intelligence community "has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable." Blurry video of highly placed men engaging in sexual acts, audio recordings of influential figures profanely insulting their nominal allies — in Russia these appear enough that a special word has evolved: "kompromat," or "compromising material." In the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Russia... Blurry video of highly placed men engaging in sexual acts, audio recordings of influential figures profanely insulting their nominal allies — in Russia these appear enough that a special word has evolved: "kompromat," or "compromising material." In the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Russia... Clapper also said in a statement released Wednesday night that he told Trump he does not believe any leaks from Friday's meeting between intelligence officials and the president-elect came from the intelligence community. Wednesday's news conference was initially billed as a chance for Trump to answer questions about his plans for distancing himself from his sprawling, family-owned real estate and licensing business. Lawyer Sheri Dillon stepped to the lectern midway through the event to announce that the president-elect was relinquishing control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons and an executive, as well as putting his business assets in a trust. While new international business deals will be banned, the company will be allowed to start new projects in the U.S. The move appears to contradict a previous pledge by the president-elect. In a tweet last month, Trump said that "no new deals" would be done while he was in office. With dramatic flair, Trump aides piled stacks of manila folders on a table next to the lectern - in front of 10 American flags - before the news conference began. Trump said the folders contained documents he had signed formalizing the new business arrangements, though journalists were not able to view and independently verify the materials. President-elect Donald Trump, under fire for his business conflicts, said Wednesday that he will turn his company over to his sons — but he won’t sell his network of properties and deals. Trump will create a trust and turn it over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric along with another business executive,...

Trump will create a trust and turn it over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric along with another business executive,... Some 250 journalists crammed into the Trump Tower lobby for the news conference, which was not only Trump's first since the election, but his first since July. Journalists shouted for his attention. At times, he skipped past questions he appeared to not want to answer, including an inquiry about whether he would keep in place sanctions Obama slapped on Russia in retaliation for the election-related hacking. Until Wednesday, Trump had spent most of his two months as president-elect doling out policy pronouncements, attacks on critics and boasts about his victory in 140-character increments on Twitter. His preferred mode of communication has left some of his positions vague - an approach that is often by Trump's design. The president-elect set some concrete policy markers Wednesday, though specifics continued to be in short supply on some of his major campaign promises. He promised that a replacement for Obama's sweeping health care overhaul would be offered "essentially simultaneously" with a congressional vote to repeal the measure. The complexity of the policy changes makes quick passage of a new health care law virtually impossible, and Trump is yet to detail what he wants included. He said his team would send a plan to Congress after Rep. Tom Price, his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is confirmed. President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. Turning to his plans to build a wall along the nation's southern border, Trump vowed that Mexico would "reimburse" the cost of the project through an unspecified tax or payment. He said that while his administration would begin negotiating with Mexico after his Jan. 20 inauguration, he did not want to delay the work until an agreement was reached, raising the prospect that U.S. taxpayers could ultimately bear the costs. "I want to get the wall started," he said. "Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed." Following Trump's remarks, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said his country "of course will not pay" for a border wall. Trump also moved to complete his Cabinet picks, announcing his intention to nominate David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, elevating him from his current role as VA undersecretary. He suggested that Shulkin may work with major private hospitals to help address issues that have plagued veterans' health care. Trump said he would move quickly to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. He said he had been interviewing candidates and seeking input from conservative groups and planned to name someone about two weeks after the inauguration. Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him while comparing the tactic to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine trust between the next commander in chief and America’s spies amid heightened threats to national security from terrorist groups and adversaries around the world with powerful new cyberweapons. Trump, for the first time, acknowledged intelligence findings that Russia hacked Democratic files in an effort to interfere with the election, but he denied that Moscow tried to help him win, while praising President Vladimir Putin and even suggesting that the hack ultimately helped American voters. “Hacking's bad and it shouldn't be done,” he told reporters. “But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.” The claim was one of several bizarre moments at a wide-ranging news conference, Trump’s first since July, that also touched on his business conflicts, his biggest campaign promises and another of his main foils, the media. The event went off with a typical level of theatrics: Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York next to stacks of file folders, ostensibly containing documents detailing the handover of his businesses to his older sons, though they were acknowledged only as an afterthought. Several other speakers took turns at the lectern, including a tax lawyer, a spokesman and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump briefly argued with a CNN correspondent, refusing to take his question. A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... Trump was asked to rule out the possibility of contacts between his associates and Russian intelligence agents during the campaign and would not do so. But he lashed out against media organizations that published unverified allegations Tuesday from a report that claimed that Russians had gathered blackmail material against him and that people in his orbit had met with Russian agents during the campaign. The unsubstantiated information was contained in a 35-page file released Tuesday by BuzzFeed, which said it was publishing the material in the interest of “transparency.” No news organization has been able to verify any of the material in the report, which CNN reported was prepared by an outside source. Media reports conflict about whether it was disclosed to Trump and President Obama in intelligence briefings last week. Donald Trump on Wednesday morning angrily denounced news reports about potentially compromising information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has collected any such intelligence.The president-elect also charged via Twitter that his "crooked opponents"... Donald Trump on Wednesday morning angrily denounced news reports about potentially compromising information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has collected any such intelligence.The president-elect also charged via Twitter that his "crooked opponents"... Trump said it was “sick people” who “put that crap together,” including unproven assertions that he encountered prostitutes at a Russian hotel. “I'm also very much of a germophobe, by the way,” he said. “Believe me.” “It was disgraceful — disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,” Trump said. “That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.” Trump continued to dismiss criticism of Russia, much of it waged by members of his own party, over the hacking of Democrats. He noted that China also has breached U.S. government systems and insisted it is not getting the attention it deserves, one of several instances when he was asked about Russia and invoked China instead in his answer. He praised Russia for denouncing the report that it was gathering blackmail material against him as “pulp fiction.” And he insisted that Russians would have released damaging information about him during the campaign if they had it, ignoring the possibility that Putin could hold onto it as leverage and contradicting intelligence officials’ conclusions that the Kremlin was specifically trying to aid Trump. “If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability,” Trump said. He added that he did not know yet whether he would ultimately get along with Putin. “I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't. And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] would be tougher on Putin than me?” he said. “Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.” Trump spoke positively of improving relations with Russia during his presidency, praising Putin and saying Moscow “can help us fight [Islamic State], which, by the way, is, No. 1, tricky.” Some of those views not only put him at odds with some U.S. intelligence officials but also many Republican members of Congress who call Putin an autocrat who violates human rights and unlawfully invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. That tension played out Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of State, faced sharp questions during his initial Senate hearing from members of both parties. The former Exxon Mobil chief has had deep business ties in the country. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican who ran against Trump for president, showed particular frustration that Tillerson would not use the term "war criminal" to describe Putin, who has overseen a legion of atrocities in Syria, where Russian troops are aiding the regime. And while Tillerson criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said policy toward Russia had to be “clear-eyed,” he stuck with his opposition to economic sanctions, which he said too often end up hurting U.S. businesses. They have been a key tool for the Obama administration to punish Russia for its incursions into Ukraine. Another top Trump Cabinet pick will face senators Thursday. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), an aerospace entrepreneur and former Army officer whom Trump has selected to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, may be asked how he intends to run an agency that has been openly mocked by his future boss. CIA leaders in the seventh-floor suites of the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va., are bracing for a confrontation when Trump’s team enters the White House. Trump said he has ordered his national security team to launch a 90-day review of the nation’s cyber defenses as soon as he takes office. And he roiled intelligence officials when his transition team issued a statement in December knocking down the CIA’s assessment that Putin had ordered the hacks in a deliberate effort to damage Clinton and bolster Trump's election prospects. The rift has grown wide enough that Trump doesn’t seem to trust the intelligence briefers to keep their encounters private. During the news conference, Trump said he recently wanted to test whether U.S. intelligence officials were telling reporters about their briefings with him, so he claimed to have met with intelligence officials without anyone in his tightly knit organization knowing. “Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know — I didn't tell her,” he said. “The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left, and immediately the word got out that I had a meeting,” he said. “It's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press,” Trump said at another point. “It's pretty sad.” Democrats warned that Trump was being shortsighted. “Trump may think that denigrating the intelligence community is good politics, or a useful way to deflect attention from the gravity of Russia's intervention on his behalf during the election,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. At some point, Trump may need to rely on intelligence reports to justify military action overseas, he said. “By casting doubt on their integrity, by mentioning the intelligence community in the same sentence as Nazi Germany, President-elect Trump is undermining the authority and credibility that he will need as president,” Schiff said.

A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations, but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Trump, however, replied Tuesday night with a Tweet declaring: “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” A senior U.S. official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia appeared to have collected embarrassing information on both major candidates, but only released material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton - a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered U.S. spy agencies' conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump win. The inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report, a development first reported Tuesday by CNN, adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russia's efforts to undermine American democracy. And it adds another bizarre twist to an already strange election year, injecting new controversy over the Trump team's relations with Russia just when the president-elect is trying to consolidate and launch his new administration. If true, the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information - known in espionage circles by the Russian term "kompromat" - that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House. The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report, an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trump's inner circle and representatives of Moscow. Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed as an "absolute fantasy" allegations that the Kremlin has collected compromising information about Trump. "The Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump, such information isn't consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy," Dmitry Peskov, who handles Putin's day-to-day communications, told journalists. U.S. officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information obtained through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official. The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in October. U.S. officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims, U.S. officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm, considered them credible, and determined that it was plausible that they would have first-hand knowledge of Russia's alleged dossier on Trump. The CIA, the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matter. After CNN's report Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general, was asked at his confirmation hearing about the allegations in the intelligence report. "If it's true, it's obviously extremely serious," Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said after reading from the CNN report. "And if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will do you?" Sessions responded that he was "not aware of any of those activities." While saying he had not spoken to Trump about the reports, he said "allegations get made about candidates all the time, and they've been made about President-elect Trump a lot." Dossiers compiled by the former British intelligence official have been circulating in Washington for months. Several news organizations, including the Washington Post, have been attempting to confirm many of the specific allegations without success. One U.S. official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations because they were already circulating widely and it was "mostly a courtesy" to let him know they were out there. Compiled initially in mid-2016 and supplemented during and after the campaign, the reports include detailed allegations that the Russians hold compromising material about Trump, some of it obtained while Trump visited Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant and on a previous visit to Russia. Other reports compiled by the former intelligence official allege contacts between Trump personnel and business officials and Russian officials during the campaign. The former intelligence official was at one point paid to explore Trump's ties to Russia by anti-Trump Republicans and later by supporters of the Democratic party. "If I was the Clinton campaign, I would be reaching out to these people who put together the dossier, and I'd ask for my money back," Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen told the Washington Post last week. "It's wrong. There's no accuracy. There's not an ounce of validity to anything that exists in that file." Last month, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had been provided with the information, personally delivered it to FBI Director James Comey. A source familiar with the matter said the FBI had it well before then and had interviewed the former intelligence official. Hillary Clinton's former campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, appealed for a congressional inquiry. "Mitch McConnell, you must let a Select Committee investigate these allegations, as @SenJohnMcCain has been urging for weeks," Fallon wrote on Twitter. K.T. McFarland, Trump's designated national security adviser, declined to respond to a question about the report. "I don't know about the story that you're talking about that's broken," she said during participation in a panel Tuesday at the United States Institute of Peace. "I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing, but I'm going to refrain." "I'm not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had. I think I'd just say what [Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Jr.] said, which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome." Clapper, however, testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election result. The two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three separate versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week, including an abbreviated declassifed draft that was made public. It was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI, CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report, or whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts' conclusions. Senior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report on declined to comment. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said that "we can't comment on what goes on in" classified briefings, but added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on U.S. leaders "should not be a surprise to anyone." "The Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician," Nunes said. "That wouldn't be news." Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia, Nunes said, "No. I found that hard to believe. I have not heard that. News to me." The Washington Post's Mike DeBonis, Karen DeYoung, Ellen Nakashima, Matt Zapotosky and Alice Crites contributed to this report.

President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here's a guide to 15 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. - "It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis." Trump is exaggerating. During the primaries, he was a near-constant presence on television because he frequently called into interview shows. But he generally only held news conferences after primary contests were held. He last held a news conference on July 27. - "You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant." Trump claims credit for these announcements, but that's wrong. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said the plan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump; he credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers. In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... With regards to Ford, analysts say Ford's decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico has more to do with the company's long-term goal - particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles - than the administration. It's easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico. - "When we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China." Actually, the Chinese hack of 22 million accounts at the Office of Personnel Management was front page news. The Russian hacking of the presidential election and the OPM hack are not directly comparable. The Russian campaign, as described by U.S. intelligence, involved more than just hacking, with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process. The Chinese hack had a more isolated goal - espionage. China appears to have wanted the material in order to engage in possible blackmail. Obama administration officials say the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying - something the United States does as well. U.S. officials also say that China responded to U.S. pressure after the hack was discovered, and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced. China may have been receptive to U.S. pressure at the time because President Xi Jinping was about to visit the United States, and he did not want the hack to mar the visit. - "The Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job….And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through." This is an example of attacking one of the victims, the Democratic National Committee. But FBI Director James Comey says there is evidence that older Republican National Committee domains were also targeted but none of the information that may have been obtained was leaked. Comey said that the Russians "got far deeper and wider into the [DNC] than the RNC," adding that "similar techniques were used in both cases." But Trump's remarks also ignore the broader implications of the unclassified intelligence report released on Jan. 5 - how the Russian government used Internet trolls and RT (Russia's state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and U.S. democracy. The Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015, well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Meanwhile, "RT's coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism," the report said. (It does not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign.) - "Look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing." Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton getting a debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich. to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint. The political class is still coming to grips with what appears to be Donald Trump’s novel management philosophy: Government by Twitter. Put aside the by-now-familiar weirdness of our president-elect’s gloating over Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor “Celebrity Apprentice” ratings or swipes at Meryl Streep.... The political class is still coming to grips with what appears to be Donald Trump’s novel management philosophy: Government by Twitter. Put aside the by-now-familiar weirdness of our president-elect’s gloating over Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor “Celebrity Apprentice” ratings or swipes at Meryl Streep.... There's no indication Clinton was told this information but in any case it's a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. In her answer, Clinton committed to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Lee-Anne Waters, who asked the question, later said Clinton's answer "made me vomit in my mouth" because that was too long to wait in Flint. - "This administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed." Trump greatly simplifies a complex situation. The Islamic State terror group arose in response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it began to fade after the Bush administration surge in 2008. The civil war in Syria breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization. The conflict in Syria created a perfect vacuum in terms of governance, and so the civil war became an opportunity for the restoration of the organization. ISIS then saw opportunity to rebound in Iraq. One factor was the withdrawal of U.S. troops order by President Obama. But there was also rampant mismanagement by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded the Iraqi military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. - "I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia." Trump is being misleading when he says he has stayed away from Russia. Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled. A man accused of interrupting a Chicago performance of the musical "Hamilton" with an obscenity-streaked outburst over his support of President-elect Donald Trump pleaded guilty Monday to charges of misdemeanor trespassing stemming from the incident, according to court records and the man's attorney. A man accused of interrupting a Chicago performance of the musical "Hamilton" with an obscenity-streaked outburst over his support of President-elect Donald Trump pleaded guilty Monday to charges of misdemeanor trespassing stemming from the incident, according to court records and the man's attorney. In a 2008 speech, Trump's son, Donald Jr., made it clear that the Trumps want to do business in Russia, but were finding it difficult. "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets," Trump's son told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia." Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post in May: "I have no doubt, as a company, I know we've looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian Republics." - "I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president." There's a lot of carrot-and-stick talk these days about how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign to hack into a bulwark of U.S. democracy, a presidential election. Donald Trump makes it clear he prefers dangling carrots. Setting aside the stick, though, would be a serious... There's a lot of carrot-and-stick talk these days about how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign to hack into a bulwark of U.S. democracy, a presidential election. Donald Trump makes it clear he prefers dangling carrots. Setting aside the stick, though, would be a serious... This is basically correct. The law doesn't say the president can't have a conflict of interest. But Congress, under Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code, did exempt the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest laws on the theory that the presidency has so much power that any possible executive action might pose a potential conflict. - "The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters….You learn very little to a tax return." Trump is wrong on both counts. A Pew Research Center poll conducted Jan. 4-9 found that 60 percent of Americans believed Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Meanwhile, tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person's finances in several key areas. First, the tax return reveals a person's annual income. A person's net worth is not disclosed, but voters would gain an understanding of a person's cash flow. Second, voters would understand the sources of a person's income, such as how much comes from certain businesses, speeches, dividends, capital gains and so forth. Third, a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity. Mitt Romney gave almost $2.3 million to charity in 2011, while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave $3 million to charity in 2014. We know these figures because of information in their tax returns. Trump claims he has given $102 million to charity in the past five years, but a Washington Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash - mostly just free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles. Trump's tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity - indeed, whether he has given anything at all. Try though they might, Republicans won't be able to erase President Barack Obama's legacy expansion of health care when they take control of the White House along with both houses of Congress. Oh, sure, it's possible that GOP lawmakers and incoming President Donald Trump will follow through on... Try though they might, Republicans won't be able to erase President Barack Obama's legacy expansion of health care when they take control of the White House along with both houses of Congress. Oh, sure, it's possible that GOP lawmakers and incoming President Donald Trump will follow through on... Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes. Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump's income actually goes to taxes. - "We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody." A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trump's comment that there "billions of dollars of losses" in trade reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese or Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would "gain" money that had been lost. - "Some states have over a hundred percent [premium] increase." Trump exaggerates here, and appears to misunderstand a fundamental part of the Affordable Care Act. State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies. The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, "anecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face." - "I want to thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs." Trump keeps counting jobs that were never going to go to Mexico in the first place. Union officials say the number of jobs saved at Carrier shrank to 730, once the official paperwork was submitted. Meanwhile, 553 jobs, focused on making fan coils, will go to Mexico, as well as 700 jobs from a United Technologies Electronics Controls (UTEC) facility. Another 400 jobs in the two facilities, mostly administrative, were never going to leave. In effect, Trump saved 37 percent of the jobs slated to depart. But Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told CNN that even more jobs at Carrier eventually would be lost through automation. - "96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number -- that's the real number." This is an absurd claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of December 2016, 95.1 million Americans 16 years and older were "not in labor force." How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 253.9 million people, and 159.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.1 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent because just 7.5 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. Trump is doing a real disservice by claiming 96 million really want a job that "they can't get." - "I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public." We cannot resist noting that Trump was the leading purveyor of false "birther" claims questions, based on no evidence, that President Obama was not born in the United States. He frequently claimed that Obama had spent $2 million to cover this up - a number he plucked out of World Net Daily, which promotes conservative-leaning conspiracy theories.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is giving a thumbs-up to president-elect Donald Trump's victory. In a brief statement Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin has sent Trump a telegram to congratulate him on winning. Putin expressed "his hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from their crisis state." Putin also says he has confidence that building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington — one based on principles of equality, mutual respect and a real accounting each other's positions — is in the interest of both nations and the world. Trump has drawn criticism for repeatedly praising Putin's leadership and advocating a closer working relationship with Russia despite its record of human rights abuses and recent military incursions in Ukraine and Syria.

In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court. The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career prosecutor and Democratic appointee, laid bare the growing discord and dissent surrounding an executive order that halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. The firing, in a written statement released just hours after Yates went public with her concerns, also served as a warning to other administration officials that Trump is prepared to terminate those who refuse to carry out his orders. Yates' refusal to defend the executive order was largely symbolic given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, will almost certainly defend the policy once he's sworn in. He's expected to be confirmed Tuesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee and could be approved within days by the full Senate. Yet the firing reflected the mounting conflict over the executive order, as administration officials have moved to distance themselves from the policy and even some of Trump's top advisers have made clear that they were not consulted on its implementation. President Trump fired acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates on Jan. 30, just hours after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend his controversial executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from certain countries. (March 24, 2015)(C-SPAN) President Trump fired acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates on Jan. 30, just hours after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend his controversial executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from certain countries. (March 24, 2015)(C-SPAN) As protests erupted at airports across the globe, and as legal challenges piled up in courthouses, Yates directed agency attorneys not to defend the executive order. She said in a memo Monday she was not convinced it was lawful or consistent with the agency's obligation "to stand for what is right." Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, soon followed with a statement accusing Yates of having "betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States." Trump named longtime federal prosecutor Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, as Yates' replacement. Boente was sworn in privately late Monday, the White House said, and rescinded Yates' directive. The chain of events bore echoes of the Nixon-era "Saturday Night Massacre," when the attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned rather than follow an order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. The prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was fired by the solicitor general. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration who was the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta and later became Loretta Lynch's deputy, was not alone in her misgivings. At least three top national security officials — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department — have told associates they were not aware of details of the directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order from the media. Trump's order pauses America's entire refugee program for four months, indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria and temporarily freezes immigration from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Federal judges in New York and several other states issued orders that temporarily block the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Trump's travel ban took effect and found themselves in limbo. Yates on Monday said that she had reviewed the policy and concluded that it was at odds with the Justice Department's mission. She said that though other lawyers in the department had reviewed the order, their review had not addressed whether it was "wise or just." "I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right," Yates wrote in a letter. Trump said the order had been "approved" by Justice Department lawyers. However, the department has said the Office of Legal Counsel review was limited to whether the order was properly drafted, but did not address broader policy questions.

Dana Boente, seen here in 2012, was named by President Donald Trump as acting attorney general on January 30, 2017. Boente was born in Carlinville, Ill. White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign. "They should either get with the program or they can go," Spicer said. The blowback underscored Trump's tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition. Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday's signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump's order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president's political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order. U.S. officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet's thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials' private views. Despite his public defense of the policy, the president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. But he's also blamed the media — his frequent target — for what he believes are reports exaggerating the dissent and the number of people actually affected. After a chaotic weekend during which some U.S. legal permanent residents were detained at airports, some agencies were moving swiftly to try to clean up after the White House. Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries. "There are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves," said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in Trump's party sought to distance themselves from the wide-ranging order. While Spicer said "appropriate committees and leadership offices" on Capitol Hill were consulted, GOP lawmakers said their offices had no hand in drafting the order and no briefings from the White House on how it would work. "I think they know that it could have been done in a better way," Corker said of the White House.

Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing public outcry over Trump's executive order temporarily banning migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from across the globe, Democrats on Capitol Hill launched what they said would be a protracted fight on several fronts. It will include public protests against the ban, delaying Cabinet confirmations and an attempt to reject Trump's pick to serve on the Supreme Court, an announcement expected Tuesday. The plans represent a sharp pivot in Democratic strategy after weeks of vowing to work with Trump and Republicans in areas of agreement - and to allow noncontroversial nominees to be quickly confirmed. But "then Trump shredded the Constitution," said one senior aide familiar with ongoing strategy talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We should be using our time on the floor to talk about the dangerous consequences to U.S. national security by this executive order, we shouldn't be rushing through any confirmation votes this week," said Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. "We can take a pause in confirmation votes to try to get this executive order right. You know this is going to get Americans killed if we don't take our time to understand what this order is and what it's consequences are," he added. Trump's ban also significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill complaining angrily Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued. Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for... Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for... At least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump's order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban does not amount to a "religious test." And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored written statements expressing concerns about the order. But others spoke out more forcefully. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Monday that he was not briefed before the order was signed. "I know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill - not in our office," said Corker. The disarray over Trump's fulfillment of a core campaign promise underscored the increasingly strained relationship between the new White House and the Republican congressional majority. It comes after a rocky first week and a half punctuated by confusion over health care and tax reform, as well as frustration with the president obsessing over crowd size and his loss of the popular vote in November. Asked if he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., the number two Republican in the Senate said simply: "I wasn't." Pressed on when he first learned about the order, Corker answered that it was Friday, after it was signed. "I guess one of you guys probably told me about it - thank you for that," Corker told reporters. Politico reported Monday night that senior House Judiciary Committee staffers helped Trump's team draft the executive order without informing party leadership. A committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in a statement following the report: "Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law. However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll out and implementation." On Monday evening, Senate Democrats sought to quickly pass legislation that would rescind Trump's ban, but there was insufficient GOP support. Confirmation delays began as well, when Democrats blocked a committee from meeting to approve Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, to the full Senate. The Senate Finance Committee is now expected to consider the former Goldman Sachs banker on Tuesday, at the same time it will vote to approve the nomination of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Amid the Democratic outcry, Trump and his aides strongly defended the ban and faulted Democrats for trying to "obstruct" his Cabinet nominees. "We actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security," Trump said at a White House event. During a meeting with small business leaders, he blasted Democrats for delaying the confirmation of his nominees "for political reasons. Just politics." But it remained unclear just how united Democrats would remain. On Monday, the Senate voted on a key procedural step toward the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with three members of the Democratic caucus supporting him - Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D, Angus King, I-Maine, Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she didn't think there would be further delays of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general; and it was unclear whether Democrats would succeed in delaying a hearing Tuesday for Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services. Committees are also scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to serve as interior secretary; and GOP powerbroker Betsy DeVos to serve as education secretary. How far Democrats go will be closely watched by the liberal activists who joined them to protest Trump's ban Monday night on the steps of the Supreme Court. After the sun set, and Democrats made their way from the Capitol, chants of "hands too small, can't build a wall" and "build a fence around Mike Pence" alternated with "walk the walk!" - a command to the Democrats themselves. And when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the crowd, "What the president did is not constitutional," one protester retorted: "You're not doing anything if you don't stop Sessions!" Meanwhile, statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. "There were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved," Spicer told reporters at a briefing. He refused to specify which if any committees were involved in the decision-making. Senior House leaders, including Ryan, did not see the text of the order until after it was signed Friday, according to a GOP aide. Antonia Ferrier, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said "it was public" that executive orders "were coming," but declined to offer further clarity on the level of interaction with the White House. Spokespeople for Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the senators were not consulted at all about the order. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said he could not confirm if his staff was consulted - but he personally did not weigh in on the executive order as it was being drafted. Grassley's committee is responsible for overseeing the majority of immigration-related legislation in the Senate. "I'm sure if they said they consulted us, they did," Grassley said. "But not me personally." A member of Grassley's committee staff worked alongside other congressional staff to assist the Trump transition team on legislative issues, including early drafting of the executive order, said one Senate GOP aide. However, that staff member did not participate in writing the final order. The White House did not share details of the order with the committee before its release on Friday, the aide said. Several GOP aides who requested anonymity to speak openly about the sensitive discussions said they were frustrated and surprised by the order and were forced to scramble to respond as chaos spread at airports across the country. Many said they felt the administration was moving too swiftly and without respect for critical protocol for vetting executive actions that have been in place for decades. "This is emblematic of a new, power-hungry White House staff flexing its muscles without consulting the public servants responsible for implementing their fiats. If this type of behavior continues, then this administration is going to lose all of its friends very quickly," said one Senate GOP aide. The freshly combative mood of Democrats has also begun to shape the debate over previously uncontroversial nominees. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who faces a 2018 re-election bid in a swing state, sent a letter to transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao on Monday with seven questions about enforcement of the ban. Failure to answer those questions overnight might be more reason to try delaying her final confirmation vote, aides said. In the end, Democrats are unlikely to derail the confirmation of any Trump nominees. While they can use procedural tactics to slow down the length of time it takes to confirm a pick, just 51 senators are needed to confirm a nominee. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate. That isn't likely to ease the pressure from the left. On Sunday night, more than a thousand protesters in Rhode Island, organized by the progressive Working Families Party, marched to an event held by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. At a rally outside the event, speaker after speaker denounced Whitehouse's vote last week to confirm CIA Director Mike Pompeo and demanded that he reject the rest of Trump's Cabinet. "Democrats alone can't block these appointments, but they can make sure they don't bear our stamp of approval," said David Segal, the executive director of the progressive transparency group, into a bullhorn. "They must vote as any one of us would vote - against surveillance, against authoritarianism, and against Trump." The Washington Post's Karoun Demirjian and David Weigel contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify the reach of Trump's action - "This is not a Muslim ban," the president said in a statement - the exact limits of its scope and legal questions over its constitutionality remained unresolved. So did the question of whether the administration would comply with orders from federal judges to temporarily halt the travel ban. Raucous protests erupted in airport terminals from coast to coast. Tens of thousands of people protested outside the gates of the White House, in Boston's Copley Square and in New York's Battery Park, with its views over the Statue of Liberty. Scenes of relief, anxiety and sorrow played out around the globe. Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, a 70-year-old Iranian woman who recently received her green card was released after being detained overnight. In New York City, a graduate student contemplated whether he would quit his doctoral program to rejoin his wife in Iran after she was blocked from returning to the United States. And in Iraq, a man who had risked his life working on behalf of the U.S. government bleakly wondered about his future and that of his wife and three children. Visas in hand, the family was due to fly Monday to the United States. "It's like someone's stabbed me in the heart with a dagger," he said. Trump issued a statement late Sunday afternoon that offered little clarity, even as he defended his executive order as necessary to protect the United States from terrorism. "To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting," Trump said in the statement. "This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order." The president reiterated that the country would resume issuing visas to all countries "once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days." Seattle City Councilwoman and socialist activist Kshama Sawant raises a fist over the crowd as more than 1,000 people gather at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Seattle to protest President Donald Trump's refugee and immigrant order Jan. 28, 2017. Seattle City Councilwoman and socialist activist Kshama Sawant raises a fist over the crowd as more than 1,000 people gather at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Seattle to protest President Donald Trump's refugee and immigrant order Jan. 28, 2017. Still, barely 48 hours after Trump issued his order, confusion reigned over its reach and its implementation. Even as the president and other top advisers defended the ban, some Trump officials appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of the action: its impact on green-card holders, who are permanent legal residents of the United States. "As far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn't affect them," Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC News' "Meet the Press," contradicting what government officials had said only a day earlier. In a separate statement, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly was less definitive, suggesting that green-card holders' status would help them gain entry to the country but that they nonetheless would be subject to a "case-by-case" review. Meanwhile, Kelly's department indicated separately Sunday that it would continue to implement Trump's directive, even as it said it "will comply with judicial orders" issued by federal judges over the weekend, blocking enforcement of the ban to varying degrees. "Prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety," the agency said in a statement. "No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States." "My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months."-- President Donald Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 In justifying his controversial order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump...

Trump's virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom. As the legal questions surrounding the order remained unanswered Sunday, the uncertainty and resentment unleashed by the executive order he signed two days earlier showed few signs of waning. At Dulles International Airport, lawyers seeking to represent people who had been detained failed to get information from Customs and Border Protection officials despite repeated attempts. Even three Democratic members of Congress - Reps. Gerald Connolly and Don Beyer of Virginia and Jamie Raskin of Maryland - ran into similar roadblocks. Connolly pressed an airport police officer to get a Customs and Border Protection official to meet with the lawmakers to tell them how many people were detained and to see whether they had been able to communicate with their attorneys. "Are people being detained?" Connolly asked the officer. "How can you enforce the law if you're not enforcing a judge's order?" BBC journalist Ali Hamedani left his native Iran in 2009 with no intention of returning to the land that had imprisoned his family. These days, even though he holds a British passport, Hamedani's birthplace roused enough concern to warrant three hours of questioning at O'Hare International Airport...

These days, even though he holds a British passport, Hamedani's birthplace roused enough concern to warrant three hours of questioning at O'Hare International Airport... Connolly soon was on the phone with a CBP congressional affairs official. He and the other members pressed for information on possible detainees, including those traveling on a flight from Turkey. No one on site from the agency would meet with them. "That is unacceptable. It is our understanding you are detaining people," Connolly said. "Our understanding is you have not followed that [court] order." The president's far-reaching action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who plan to assemble Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court in a show of solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. In addition, at least one House member said he plans to introduce legislation to overturn Trump's action by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. Trump also encountered growing opposition Sunday from lawmakers in his own party. "You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have," Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union," even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., also spoke out against the action, saying in a joint statement that the government has a responsibility to defend its borders but must uphold "all that is decent and exceptional about our nation." "It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted," they said, adding, "Such a hasty process risks harmful results." In a tweet Sunday afternoon, Trump was quick to criticize McCain and Graham as "sadly weak on immigration." And Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump's order.

A top Trump official appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of an executive order that bans entry to the United States from refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries: its impact on green-card holders, who are permament legal residents... "I don't want to criticize them for improving vetting," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC's "This Week." He cautioned that the United States doesn't have a religious test for entry into the country, and he stopped short of saying that Trump's action amounted to a Muslim ban. "I think we need to be careful," McConnell said. "We don't have religious tests in this country." The Department of Homeland Security noted that "less than one percent" of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were "inconvenienced" by the executive order - though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Federal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump's action flooded courtrooms. A federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in California, Virginia, Seattle and Boston. Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigration and to impose what became known as his "Muslim ban,'' remained unbowed Sunday. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. Just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: "Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, "Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!" Many Americans agreed with Trump. "He doesn't hate Muslims," said Kelley Anne Finn of Manassas, Virginia, who was interviewed at Dulles airport Sunday. "He doesn't hate anybody. He's trying to protect us." Administration officials said Sunday that they think it is possible for the White House to both comply with a judge's order and continue enforcing Trump's executive action. Their thinking is that the court order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the court order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place. The officials pointed out that while the order affects deportations, the travelers stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States. That interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. As Sunday wore on, it became clear that the answers to those questions would have to wait until another day. The protesters outside the White House pushed on, wielding poster boards with messages such as "Islamophobia is un-American" and "Dissent is patriotic," chanting "No justice! No peace!" and singing renditions of "This Land is Your Land." And in airports from Baltimore to Bangor, from Dallas to Denver, shouts of "Let them go!" and "Let them in!" reverberated Sunday. In many cities, demonstrators invoked the same chant: "No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here." --- The Washington Post's Philip Bump in New York, Daniel Gross in Boston, and Michael Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Jenna Johnson, Sarah Larimer, Michael Laris, Ellen Nakashima, Ed O'Keefe, Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell, Elise Viebeck and David Weigel in Washington contributed to this report.

"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months."-- President Donald Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 In justifying his controversial order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump claimed that Obama did the same thing in 2011. But the comparison is a bit facile. Here's what happened in 2011: The facts The only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: "As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News -- even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets." President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... The "Kentucky case" refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan's fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005. The arrests caused in uproar in Congress, and the Obama administration pledged to re-examine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq War. "The enhanced screening procedures have caused a logjam in regular visa admissions from Iraq, even for those who risked their lives to aid American troops and who now fear reprisals as the Obama administration winds down the U.S. military presence," the Baltimore Sun reported. The Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. official acknowledged delays, but were trying to speed up the process: "A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged 'unfortunate delays' in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process. The State Department's National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. 'We are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,' the official said." At a September 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Susan Collins asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano if there had been a hold placed on Iraqi visa applications. "COLLINS: 'So my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we're not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?' "NAPOLITANO: 'Yep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC (National Counter Terrorism Center) databases and the Department of Defense's biometric databases and so that work has not been done and focused.' "COLLINS: 'That's completed?' "NAPOLITANO: 'That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don't know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.' " The new rules were stringent, The Economist reported, and it resulted in some turmoil. "Immigration authorities soon began rechecking all Iraqi refugees in America, reportedly comparing fingerprints and other records with military and intelligence documents in dusty archives. About 1,000 soon-to-be immigrants in Iraq were told that they would not be allowed to board flights already booked. Some were removed from planes. Thousands more Iraqi applicants had to restart the immigration process, because their security clearances expired when the program stalled. Men must now pass five separate checks, women four, and children three." State Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. But it's unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said "pace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl," indicating some were still being approved. The Pinocchio test So what's the difference with Trump's action? First, Obama responded to an actual threat -- the discovery that two Iraqi refugees has been implicated in bomb-making in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. Under congressional pressure, officials decided to re-examine all previous refugees and also impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. Second, Obama did not announce there was a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano's answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had been slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it was their policy to halt all applications. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval. Third, Obama's policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green card holders, from traveling the United States. Trump's policy is much more sweeping. We have sought comment from the White House and also from Obama administration officials and so may update this if more information becomes available. But so far this is worthy of at least Two Pinocchios.

Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said President Donald Trump wanted a "Muslim ban" and requested he assemble a commission to show him "the right way to do it legally." Giuliani, an early Trump supporter who once had been rumored for a cabinet position in the new administration, appeared on Fox News late Saturday night to describe how Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees came together. Trump on Friday signed orders not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement "new vetting measures" to screen out "radical Islamic terrorists." Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - are suspended for 90 days. Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro asked Giuliani if the ban had anything to do with religion. "How did the president decide the seven countries?" she asked. "OK, talk to me." "I'll tell you the whole history of it," Giuliani responded eagerly. "So when (Trump) first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'" Giuliani continued, saying he assembled a "whole group of other very expert lawyers on this," including former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.

President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... "And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger - the areas of the world that create danger for us," Giuliani told Pirro. "Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country." It was unclear when the above-mentioned phone call took place and when the commission began working. An email to the White House press office was not immediately returned Sunday. Clips of the exchange between Giuliani and Pirro quickly went viral Saturday night, with some claiming that Giuliani's statement amounted to admitting Trump's intent had been to institute a ban based on religion. Others, including Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, have insisted it is not a ban on Muslims, but rather one based on countries from which travel was already restricted under the Obama administration. "My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months."-- President Donald Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 In justifying his controversial order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump...

Priebus appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday morning to say it was possible Trump would expand the list of countries included in the travel ban. "You can point to other countries that have similar problems, like Pakistan and others," Priebus told host John Dickerson. "Perhaps we need to take it further." Priebus also said there had been weeks of work and "plenty of communication" between the White House, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security regarding the ban. "We didn't just type this thing up in an office and sign up," he told Dickerson. Later on the same program, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., called out Giuliani's interview with Pirro from the night before. "They can't deny that this is a Muslim ban," Ellison told Dickerson. "On the campaign trail, (Trump) said he wanted a Muslim ban. ... Rudy Giuliani who helped him write it said that they started out with the intention of a Muslim ban and then they sort of 'languaged' it up so to try to avoid that label, but it is a religiously based ban." Senate Democrats vowed to draft legislation to block the travel ban. "We're demanding the president reverse these executive orders that go against what we are, everything we have always stood for," Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer. D-N.Y., said in a news conference Sunday morning, noting later that his middle name, Ellis, was originally inspired by Ellis Island. "It was implemented in a way that created chaos and confusion across the country, and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe those that will do us harm," Schumer added. "It must be reversed immediately." Trump's executive order caused mayhem and sparked massive protests at airports around the country Friday and Saturday, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders, were being detained. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Saturday morning challenging Trump's order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at John F. Kennedy International Airport. As Giuliani was speaking, Fox News simultaneously aired an alert that noted federal judge Ann M. Donnelly had issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide. Donnelly wrote that there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution. "There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 Executive Order," Donnelly wrote. The ACLU hailed the victory. "Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country," ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero said in a statement. "Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court." On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying it did not plan to back off enforcing Trump's orders. "President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety," the statement read. "President Trump's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security." The department said that less than one percent of daily international air travelers to the United States had been "inconvenienced" on Saturday. Matthew Kolken, an immigration attorney based in Buffalo, said there has been "a systemic bias against individuals from Muslim countries in the U.S. immigration departments" for years, including under the Obama administration. "This isn't unprecedented," Kolken told The Washington Post by phone Sunday. "The unfortunate reality is the executive branch does have vast discretionary authority to determine who they are going (allow in or not)." That said, Kolken believes "Trump has gone a step further without a doubt" in including even people who are lawful permanent residents and suspending all immigration applications from people from the seven countries on the banned list. If there was evidence of disparate treatment of individuals from the same country - if there were anecdotal evidence of, for example, a Syrian family of one religious background allowed to enter over that of another religious background - then that is where lawsuits could "come to play," he said. "The question becomes whether they're trying to do an end-around by couching the ban as a country-specific ban based on a security-related issues when in reality it's a religious ban," Kolken said.

Though cast as measures meant to make the country safe, the Trump administration's moves during its first week in office are more likely to weaken the counterterrorism defenses the United States has erected over the past 16 years, several current and former U.S. officials said. Through inflammatory rhetoric and hastily drawn executive orders, the administration has alienated allies, including Iraq, provided propaganda fodder to terror networks that frequently portray U.S. involvement in the Middle East as a religious crusade, and endangered critical cooperation from often hidden U.S. partners - whether the leader of a mosque in an American suburb or the head of a Middle East intelligence service. An executive order - issued Friday and titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States" - bans entry to people from a list of Muslim-majority nations including Iraq, where U.S. military and intelligence agencies have for years relied on cooperation from Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, not to mention thousands of individual translators and contractors. "Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism," Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, S.C.,and John McCain, Ariz., said Sunday in a statement. "This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security." Already, supporters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, quickly claimed the travel ban as a victory. Postings on social-media sites linked to the terrorist group predicted that President Trump's order would galvanize Muslims and claimed that it showed that the United States is at war with Islam. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In tweets Sunday, Trump said, "The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III."

President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... Separately, in a statement, Trump said the "seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror," and he noted that Obama had barred refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011. Trump's inauguration vow to put America first and "only America" rattled allies. A leaked draft of an order on U.S. detention policies compounded those concerns by raising the prospect of rebuilding the CIA's network of notorious "black site" prisons around the world. The immigration measures imposed late Friday were seen by U.S counterterrorism officials and analysts as particularly counterproductive and poorly conceived. "The whole order is and will be read as another anti-Islam, anti-Muslim action by this president and his administration," said Paul Pillar, a former top official in the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. "It is not targeted at where the threat is, and the anti-Islam message that it sends is more likely to make America less safe."

Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for... Absent from the Trump list: Saudi Arabia or any of the other countries connected to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Nor does the president's action limit travel from Pakistan, where al-Qaeda's leadership still resides. Former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said that the order and other possible measures have likely forced U.S. diplomats, military commanders and agency station chiefs abroad into damage-control mode. "We've got good people who will work hard at it, but there is no question that this has already created an irretrievable cost," Hayden said. The refugee order "inarguably has made us less safe. It has taken draconian measures against a threat that was hyped. The by-product is it feeds the jihadist narrative and makes it harder for our allies to side with us." Despite acute concerns about the impact overseas, analysts said much of the damage may happen in the United States. Counterterrorism officials have for years cast the successful integration of Muslims in the United States as a major security advantage over countries in Europe, where Muslims are more likely to be isolated and marginalized. Those who study extremism fear that the sense of belonging among U.S. Muslims may begin to fray, increasing the likelihood that a U.S. citizen or resident becomes radicalized, and complicates the already-difficult task for the FBI and local authorities to cultivate relationships with Muslim community leaders. "It was already an uphill climb," said Seamus Hughes, a former National Counterterrorism Center official who frequently traveled the country to meet with Muslim community members after terrorist attacks. Tips to the FBI or local police from concerned parents, religious leaders and concerned Muslim citizens have been "the lifeblood of most terrorism investigations" in the United States, said Hughes, who is now at George Washington University. "I don't see anyone hesitating to report an imminent threat," he said, but adding, "I can't see these orders as helping." But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, "In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe's tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration's executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland." In terms of overseas partnerships, no relationship has been placed under more immediate strain than that of the United States and Iraq. Trump used his speech at CIA headquarters on his first day in office to declare that it was a mistake for the United States not to have seized Iraq's oil reserves after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and to hint that there might be another chance to do so. The executive order sparked confusion and condemnation in Baghdad. Iraqis who had worked with the U.S. military for years, often at great risk, were among the first people affected by the regulations. Even before the new measures were issued, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters that his country's oil "is for Iraqis." The comment also explicitly confirmed widely held suspicions in the Middle East of U.S. geopolitical motivations. "It's about oil and it's a plot to destroy Islam," said Dan Byman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. "If you want to combine conspiracy theories, [Trump] is doing a good job." Iraqi lawmakers over the weekend insisted that Iraq impose similar measures on the United States. Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shiite cleric, called the decision to block Iraqi entry while Americans still come and go, "arrogance," and he demanded that U.S. nationals leave the country. Iraqis also have questioned the omission from the travel ban of certain Gulf and North Africa countries, whose nationals have been involved in high-profile terrorist attacks Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for Abadi, said that the U.S. security partnership with Iraq, including American support for operations against the Islamic State and a robust arms sales program, should make the relationship with Iraq different from other countries on the list. The new measures take place as the Pentagon continues to rely closely on Iraq in its campaign to defeat the Islamic State. More than 6,000 U.S. troops are now stationed in the country, advising Iraqi forces during a major battle in Mosul, the militant-held northern city. The decision undermines Abadi, straddled between a Western ally whose support he needs to fight militants and Shiite political peers who view the U.S. presence with hostility. Lukman Faily, who served as the Iraqi ambassador in Washington until last year, said that Abadi would try to draw a distinction between Iraq's security partnership with the United States and the perceived snub contained in Trump's new order "It will certainly put the prime minister in the most awkward position," Faily said. "It will not help him navigate his politics while he's completing [a major battle] and while he has an oil crisis to deal with." Hadithi sought to stress the temporary nature of the order. "We will have a discussion with the American side," Hadithi said. "If it's only for a short time to reorganize their visa and refugees work, we will understand it and take it positively." It's not yet clear, however, whether the 90-day period stipulated in the executive order will be extended. The Washington Post's Joby Warrick and Julie Tate contributed to this report.

It's a rough week to be Paul Ryan. Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass. Now, the party has given itself just a few days to come up with a bill the party can unite behind, and the bill's GOP critics are pulling in opposite directions. Centrist Republicans are worried about ending some of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed millions of Americans to obtain health insurance for the first time. After a decade, 24 million additional Americans could be uninsured under the GOP plan, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Moderate Republicans want to make sure that the government does not abandon those who benefited from Obamacare. That's the opposite of the criticism coming from the GOP's conservative wing. They feel that under the bill as written, the government would be doing too much in health insurance - continuing to help middle-class families buy coverage and regulating the plans that insurers can sell. "The problem is, there are taxes, mandates and subsidies - sounds a lot like Obamacare lite to me," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said recently, summarizing the views of many conservative members of the House. And if the party wants to pass any bill at all, it can't write off either wing. With no Democrats expected to support the bill, 22 defecting House Republicans would be enough to sink it. Ryan and the GOP leadership have even less room to maneuver because Congress's rules limit the kinds of changes they can make to the bill without exposing it to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Ryan, R-Wis., in his official capacity as speaker of the House and his unofficial role as GOP wonk-in-chief, is the one tasked with making the legislative magic happen. He and other party leaders get a shot at it Wednesday, when the House Rules Committee meets to consider changes to the bill before it gets a full vote on the House floor. Medicaid: Many of the likely defectors in the Republican caucus are hard-line conservatives. Among their objections is that the bill would do too little to constrain Medicaid, the federal program that provides health insurance to the poor. Obamacare expanded Medicaid to cover more of the poor and more people who are near poverty. The current version of the GOP bill would largely preserve that expansion through 2020, and after that date, the law would grandfather in those beneficiaries who had joined Medicaid before and remained enrolled. Even those changes are likely to reduce Medicaid enrollment by a sixth after a decade and reduce spending on the program by $880 billion over that period, the CBO estimates. Conservative Republicans would like to undo the expansion immediately. They would also like to convert the program into a fixed payment to states, which would then use the money to pay for health care for poor residents. When bioethicist and oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, the session revealed publicly what has been happening privately for months: A trusted ally of former President Barack Obama and chief architect of the Affordable Care Act is trying to help... When bioethicist and oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, the session revealed publicly what has been happening privately for months: A trusted ally of former President Barack Obama and chief architect of the Affordable Care Act is trying to help... Yet as GOP lawmakers revise the bill to appease their conservative colleagues, they will have to be careful not to drive moderate members away from the legislation. A block grant could mean that states are able to cover fewer of their residents. Accelerating the end of the expansion would also result in more Americans going without coverage - a troubling development for moderates already fretting over adding millions to the ranks of the uninsured. "Doing that would be a nonstarter and would be enormously and hugely problematic for many of our members," Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a centrist congressman, told The Washington Post last week. Entitlements: Under the Republican plan, the government would also continue helping working- and middle-class households buy health insurance. Conservative Republicans say this provision of the bill simply extends one of Obamacare's defining features. In many cases, the benefits for these households would be substantially less generous under the Republican plan than under Obamacare. The benefits would be based on age, not income as in the existing system, so less-affluent families that have enjoyed more generous subsidies under Obamacare would be especially burdened. On the one hand, the new proposed benefits might not be generous enough to allow many Americans to pay for health insurance. The financial effects on those in older middle age - many of whom CBO projects are likely to give up on buying coverage - have been a particular sticking point for Republican lawmakers. But even the current level of the benefits has turned off several conservative Republicans, who question whether the government should be providing the subsidies at all. Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks called the proposal "the largest welfare program ever sponsored by the Republican Party" in a recent interview with The Washington Post. And Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has repeatedly called the GOP legislation's proposed system "a new entitlement." All of the Republicans on the budget committee, including some of the most conservative lawmakers in the House, voted last week in favor of recommending that the proposal be revised to offer more financial help to less affluent households. That unanimous tally suggests that Republicans getting the bill ready for the floor might be able to win over moderate members without giving up conservative support. Regulation: Rather than relying on public benefits to help American families pay for insurance, conservative lawmakers argue that the free market can make health care affordable without the need for subsidies. Jordan, the congressman from Ohio, called the Republican plan "subsidies for unaffordable health care, subsidies for unaffordable premiums," in a recent interview with The Post. Right-leaning experts on health care argue that one source of costs in the system is Obamacare's requirement that insurance policies cover certain basic benefits, including routine services such as preventive and outpatient care. Instead, according to this reasoning, insurance companies should be allowed to offer bare-bones plans with cheap premiums that would not cover routine medical care, but would protect subscribers from bankruptcy in case of a severe and costly illness or accident. The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... The goal would be to reduce spending on health care nationally. Clinics and hospitals would mark down prices for routine services to compete for customers, who would scrutinize the value of the care they receive more carefully, reducing waste. Meanwhile, ordinary people would be able to protect themselves from catastrophic costs without paying exorbitant monthly premiums. Yet the Republican bill does not repeal the regulations that Obamacare imposed on the kinds of policies insurance companies can offer. Some of Obamacare's rules are popular, such as the requirement that plans cover subscribers' children until they turn 26 and that companies cover patients regardless of their preexisting medical conditions. At the same time, Republicans are using a congressional procedure to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate that bars language not directly related to federal spending or revenue. GOP leaders are apparently concerned that legislation affecting how the insurance industry is regulated would not meet that requirement. "Insurers need to be able to be freed from regulatory burdens that prohibit them from really offering those kinds of plans, and figuring out what people want to pay for," Strain said.

House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed health-care overhaul, unveiled changes to the legislation late Monday that they think will win over enough members to secure its passage. The tweaks addressed numerous GOP concerns about the legislation, ranging from the flexibility it would give states to administer their Medicaid programs to the amount of aid it would offer older Americans to buy insurance. They are the product of two weeks of negotiations that stretched from the Capitol to the White House to President Donald Trump's Florida resort. The bill's proponents also appeared to overcome a major obstacle Monday after a key group of hard-line conservatives declined to take a formal position against the bill, known as the American Health Care Act. The House Freedom Caucus has threatened for weeks to tank the legislation drafted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., arguing that it does not do enough to undo the seven-year-old Affordable Care Act. Their neutrality gives the legislation a better chance of passage: If the group of about three dozen hard-right GOP members uniformly opposed the bill, it could block its passage. Their decision not to act as a bloc frees House leaders and White House officials to persuade individual Freedom Caucus members to support the measure — a process that the Freedom Caucus's chairman said was underway. "They're already whipping with a whip that's about 10 feet long and five feet wide," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. "I'm trying to let my members vote the way that their constituents would want them to vote. ... I think they're all very aware of the political advantages and disadvantages." President Donald Trump is deploying an outside and inside strategy to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, seeking support beyond Washington before making an in-person pitch on Capitol Hill.

President Donald Trump is deploying an outside and inside strategy to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, seeking support beyond Washington before making an in-person pitch on Capitol Hill. Trump rallied supporters Monday night in Louisville, Ky., alongside Senate Majority... House leaders hope to pass the bill Thursday and then send it to the Senate. Trump is expected to press for the bill's passage in a Tuesday morning meeting with Republican lawmakers. Some of the changes unveiled Monday were made to placate conservatives, such as accelerating the expiration of the ACA's taxes and further restricting the federal Medicaid program. But a major push was made to win moderate votes, including a maneuver that House leaders said would allow the Senate to beef up tax credits for older Americans who could see major increases in premiums under the GOP plan. There were signs Monday that the bill had growing support among the moderate wing of the House GOP. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who had voted against the leadership in an early procedural vote on the health-care legislation, said that he was "satisfied enough that I will support the bill." It's a rough week to be Paul Ryan. Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass.

Republicans' first attempt at a replacement for the Democrats' health-care law was panned by enough members of the party to cast real doubt on whether repeal would ever pass. Now, the party has given itself just a few days to come up with a bill the party can... MacArthur said he was assured that the bill would do more for older and disabled Americans covered under Medicaid and that an additional $85 billion in aid would be directed to those between ages 50 and 65. "That's a $150 billion change in this bill to help the poor and those who are up in years," he said. Several House Republicans from Upstate New York won an amendment that would allow counties in their state to keep hundreds of millions of dollars of local tax revenue that they forward to the state government to fund its Medicaid program. One member, Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., told the Syracuse Post-Standard on Monday that her support of the bill was conditioned on the amendment's inclusion. Opponents of the bill - Republicans and Democrats alike - called the deal a sordid giveaway on social media networks Monday night. Many compared it to the state-specific deals that were cut to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 and panned by Republicans - such as the Medicaid reimbursement boost that then-Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., secured for his home state that Republicans mocked as the "Cornhusker Kickback." The Freedom Caucus had pushed for a variety of alterations, from an earlier phaseout of the ACA's Medicaid expansion to a more thorough rollback of the insurance mandates established under the law. But for political and procedural reasons, few of the group's major demands stand to be incorporated into the bill. "It's very clear that the negotiations are over," said Meadows, who met with White House officials at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday. Many Freedom Caucus members who left the group's Capitol Hill meeting Monday night said they remained sharply opposed to the legislation. "Nothing's changed," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a co-founder of the caucus. "We've still got lots of problems with this bill. ... The president's a good man, and the White House has been great to work with, but opposition is still strong with our group." Under the group's rules, it can take a formal position to oppose the bill if 80 percent of its members agree. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, meaning Republican leaders can afford to lose no more than 21 of their own members. Meadows said after Monday night's meeting that taking a hard position against the bill "creates some dynamics within the group that perhaps we don't want to create," hinting at tensions in the group's ranks. One of its members, Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., decided to support the bill last week when he met with Trump in the Oval Office, emboldening House leaders who think that even hard-liners will be hard-pressed to oppose Trump. "This is a defining moment for our nation, but it's also a defining moment for the Freedom Caucus," Meadows said. "There are core things within this bill as it currently stands that would violate some of the principles of the Freedom Caucus." Attending the Freedom Caucus meeting Monday were three senators opposed to the House bill - Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., - who hold leverage to block the bill in their own chamber, where Republicans hold a two-seat majority. Cruz said he told the House members that the leadership strategy of pursuing distinct "phases" of legislation was a dead end and that they needed to push for changes in the present bill. "The Senate Democrats are engaging in absolute opposition and obstruction, and it is difficult to see that changing anytime soon," Cruz told reporters after leaving the meeting. Trump's visit to the Hill on Tuesday signals that GOP leaders and the president consider larger-scale talks with key blocs of House members to be essentially complete. The effort now turns toward persuading individual members to vote for the package. Ryan credited Trump's backing in a statement Monday: "With the president's leadership and support for this historic legislation, we are now one step closer to keeping our promise to the American people and ending the Obamacare nightmare." Trump's visit Tuesday will be his first appearance at the weekly House Republican Conference meeting since becoming president. He last privately addressed Republican lawmakers as a group at the party's policy retreat in Philadelphia in late January and has met with small groups of members on several occasions since. Trump won the backing of Palmer and several other conservative House members Friday when he agreed to make changes to the Medicaid portion of the bill, including giving states the option of instituting a work requirement for childless, able-bodied adults who receive the benefit. Those changes were included in the leadership-backed amendments that will be incorporated into the bill before it comes to a final vote. To address concerns expressed by a broader swath of GOP lawmakers — conservatives and moderates alike — leaders said they hoped to change the bill to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance. In an extreme case laid out in a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 a year would see yearly premiums rise from $1,700 under the ACA to $14,600 under the Republican plan. House leaders said they intended to provide another $85 billion of aid to those between ages 50 and 64, but the amendment unveiled late Monday did not do so directly. Instead, the leaders said, it "provides the Senate flexibility to potentially enhance the tax credit" for the older cohort by adjusting an unrelated tax deduction. That workaround, aides said, was done to ensure that the House bill would comply with Senate budget rules and to ensure that the CBO could release an updated analysis of the legislation before the Thursday vote. But it also means that the House members who pushed for the new aid will have to trust the Senate to carry out their wishes. The Washington Post's Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump agreed to add fresh Medicaid curbs to the House Republican health care bill Friday, bolstering the measure with support from some conservative lawmakers but leaving its prospects wobbly. House leaders discussed other amendments calibrated to round up votes and scheduled a showdown vote Thursday. "I just want to let the world know I am 100 percent in favor" of the measure, Trump said at the White House after meeting around a dozen House lawmakers and shaking hands on revisions. "We're going to have a health care plan that's going to be second to none." While the rapid-fire events seemed to build momentum for the pivotal GOP legislation, its fate remained clouded. One leading House conservative said the alterations were insufficient and claimed enough allies to sink the measure, and support among moderates remained uncertain. "My whip count indicates that there are 40 no's," enough to defeat the bill, said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who leads the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. He said the change "doesn't move the ball more than a couple yards on a very long playing field." Across the Capitol, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., facing re-election next year, became the fourth Republican senator to announce his opposition. That left Senate GOP leaders at least two votes shy of what they'd need to prevail. Congressional Democrats remain solidly opposed to the GOP effort. Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Thursday will mark the seventh anniversary of when Obama signed his health overhaul into law, one of his milestone domestic achievements enacted over unanimous GOP opposition. Beyond that symbolism, Republican leaders hope to allow time for Congress to complete the measure before an early April recess exposes lawmakers to two weeks of lobbying and town hall pressure tactics by activists, doctors, hospitals and other opponents. The Republican bill would kill much of former President Barack Obama's health care law, including tax penalties for people who don't buy insurance and its expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. It would create new tax credits that would be less generous than current federal subsidies for many consumers, and repeal levies on the wealthy and medical firms that helped finance Obama's expansion of coverage to 20 million Americans. Trump's deal with lawmakers would let states impose work requirements on some of Medicaid's roughly 60 million recipients. The condition would apply to healthy people with no dependents, a White House official said. The agreement would let states accept lump-sum federal payments for Medicaid, instead of an amount that would grow with the number of beneficiaries. The program currently costs the federal government around $370 billion annually and covers costs no matter the amounts. Also, any additional states that expand Medicaid would not receive the additional federal money Obama's law provided them for doing so. Thirty-one states have enlarged their Medicaid rolls under the law. "These changes definitely strengthen our numbers," said the House GOP's top vote counter, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, among Trump's guests Friday. "But they also show that President Trump is all-in now" to help win converts. The Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act cleared a key hurdle Thursday, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists.

The Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act cleared a key hurdle Thursday, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists. All of the panel's Republicans... Those accepting the agreement included Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., leader of the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives. It seemed clear that GOP leaders remained short of the 216 votes they'll need, and additional changes were in the works. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said he'd been assured by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that the bill's tax credit would be adjusted to focus more benefits on lower-income people. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., among those who met with Trump, said the president "told his people" to work on changes making the measure more generous for lower-earning and older Americans. "Everything has to be a change that would increase the vote count," Scalise said. Conservatives seemed unlikely to achieve their demands that the GOP bill's phase-out of Obama's Medicaid expansion — now 2020 — be accelerated to next year and that the credit be denied people with little or no tax liability. Centrists remained wary of yanking constituents from coverage. Many represent states where voters have gained Medicaid and other insurance under the 2010 statute. "We'll see what changes they're going to make," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. In a report this week that prompted many GOP lawmakers to emerge as opponents, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would leave 24 million people uninsured in a decade, including 14 million next year, and boost out-of-pocket costs for many. Heller joined three fellow GOP senators in opposing the bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas have voiced strong objections, and Senate moderates don't want to boot constituents off coverage. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority. Nevada has expanded Medicaid and GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval has expressed opposition to the Republican legislation.

The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does," Ryan, R-Wis., said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, in which he confirmed that House leaders are eyeing a Thursday vote on its passage. Meanwhile, a key conservative senator said White House officials were continuing to negotiate through the weekend on even more dramatic revisions to the bill in hopes of winning over hard-liners who have threatened to tank the legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he and two other conservative leaders - Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus - met at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in an attempt "to fix this bill." "I cannot vote for any bill that keeps premiums rising," Cruz said, echoing the concerns of other hard-line lawmakers who want the legislation to undo more of the Affordable Care Act's insurance mandates. "President Trump said this is one big, fat negotiation. Here is the central prize: If we lower premiums, and hopefully lower them a lot, that is a victory for the American people." "It's a fine needle that needs to be threaded, no doubt about it," said Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, speaking about the negotiations Sunday on ABC's "This Week." President Donald Trump agreed to add fresh Medicaid curbs to the House Republican health care bill Friday, bolstering the measure with support from some conservative lawmakers but leaving its prospects wobbly.

President Donald Trump agreed to add fresh Medicaid curbs to the House Republican health care bill Friday, bolstering the measure with support from some conservative lawmakers but leaving its prospects wobbly. House leaders discussed other amendments calibrated to round up votes and scheduled a... Ryan's declaration that more would be done to help older Americans came after a third House moderate said Saturday that he could not support the bill "in its current form." Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who represents a suburban Philadelphia district that has been heavily targeted by Democrats, said in a Facebook post that he was most concerned that the legislation would roll back efforts to prevent and treat opioid abuse. But he said that was one concern of many, and lawmakers from across the GOP's ideological spectrum have expressed fears that the American Health Care Act will not drive down prices. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Leonard Lance, R-N.J., have cited that concern in announcing their opposition to the bill, and several other moderates remain undecided. Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Those fears were stoked last week by a Congressional Budget Office analysis that forecasted a short-term increase in premiums under the GOP law, and while premiums are expected to drop by roughly 10 percent over a 10-year horizon, some older and low-income people would face massive premium hikes. Those over 50 but not yet 65 - and thus eligible for Medicare, the federal health program for seniors - represent a major issue in forging an alternative to the ACA. That age group tends to have more medical issues than younger adults and, thus, higher insurance costs, and the ACA forbids insurers to charge their oldest customers more than three times their rates for young adults - essentially having young adults cross-subsidize the cost of coverage for older ones. But House Republicans want to eliminate that feature of the law, and the GOP bill would allow a five-to-one ratio as part of an attempt to attract more of the younger, healthier customers whom insurers want. In an extreme case laid out in the CBO report, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 a year would see yearly premiums rise from $1,700 under the ACA to $14,600 under the Republican plan. Ryan questioned that analysis, suggesting that administrative actions taken by the Trump administration would further lower premiums and questioning whether the ACA would remain viable in a decade. But he acknowledged that the GOP bill would probably have to change. "We believe we should have even more assistance, and that's one of the things we're looking at for that person in the 50s and 60s because they experience higher health-care costs," he said. The GOP bill as currently written offers a fixed tax credit for low- and middle-income Americans that rises by age. But it does not rise and fall, like the ACA's subsidies, so a person pays only a fixed percentage of their income on their health insurance premiums. That, according to the CBO estimate, leads to substantial cost savings that - together with cuts to Medicaid - allow the GOP plan to eliminate nearly all of the taxes imposed under the ACA. Trump won the support of several conservative House members on Friday when he agreed to make changes to the Medicaid portion of the bill, including giving states the option of instituting a work requirement on childless, able-bodied adults who receive the benefit. But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has worked closely with the hard-right bloc in the House, said on "This Week" that the bill was still short of a majority. "They still believe that the conservatives in their caucus don't want Obamacare Lite," he said. "I believe that the real negotiation begins when we stop them. You have to stop them." Paul noted that he passed out notes based on Trump's book "The Art of the Deal" at a meeting he had with Freedom Caucus members last week: "We need to learn from the master, and let's make sure that we increase our leverage by holding the line." But Ryan expressed confidence that the bill would pass the House this week - and then move to the Senate, where the legislation is facing even sharper doubts and the GOP majority is much narrower. He cited Trump's hands-on involvement as a key factor is moving the legislation forward. "We are making fine-tuning improvements to the bill to reflect people's concerns, to reflect people's improvements," he said. "The president is bringing people to his table, and I'm very impressed with how the president is helping us close this bill, and making the improvements that we've been making, getting the votes. ... We are right where we want to be."

A Republican proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Donald Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with several conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to negotiate its details and that it does not yet have enough votes to emerge from the House. More acknowledgment of the proposal's problems came from Senate Republicans, who suggested Thursday that the measure is moving too quickly through the House and in a form unlikely to succeed once it moves to the upper chamber. Yet the plan emerged from two key House committees Thursday, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., its top booster, insisted that the pending legislation represents the "only chance we're going to get" to fulfill the GOP's longstanding promise to undo the Affordable Care Act. The GOP proposal cleared the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees on party-line votes after marathon sessions that lasted through Wednesday night and into Thursday. It now heads to yet another panel, the Budget Committee, and it remains on track to land on the House floor by month's end. But the proposal faces challenges with both GOP conservatives and moderates, in addition to Democrats, many of whom questioned the lightning-fast process and raising dueling qualms about its policy provisions. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared to echo a Democratic attack on the House legislation, saying lawmakers need to see the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate of how the bill will affect the federal deficit and the number of insured Americans. "I think we need to know that," McConnell said at a breakfast sponsored by Politico, adding that the report could be released by Monday. Trump and Ryan have adopted diverging approaches to critics of the overhaul. While Trump has endorsed the legislation, he has expressed a willingness to make deals with its critics in recent days, while Ryan has emphasized the precarious nature of the legislation House leaders have drafted, all but ruling out substantial changes to the bill before it comes up for a final vote. At an unusual Thursday news conference carried live on cable news channels, a shirt-sleeved Ryan gave a 23-minute presentation. Republicans, he said, face a "binary choice" - vote for the House bill, or let the ACA survive. "We as Republicans have been waiting seven years to do this," Ryan said. "This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here. The time is now. This is the moment." House Energy and Commerce Committee member Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., left, and Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., pause as members of the committee argue the details of the GOP's "Obamacare" replacement bill after working all night on March 9, 2017 in Washington.

Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., pause as members of the committee argue the details of the GOP's "Obamacare" replacement bill after working all night on March 9, 2017 in Washington. Hours later, leaders of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus visited the White House and made a personal case to Trump to modify the legislation - changes that Ryan and other House leaders believe would imperil it by alienating more moderate Republicans. "I didn't hear anything that said it's a binary choice at the White House today," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the Freedom Caucus chairman, who met with Trump and other lawmakers at the White House. Meadows declined to detail the changes he and other conservatives are seeking, but they have leveled three broad objections to the Ryan-backed bill: that the system of tax credits it creates constitutes a new government entitlement, that it does not do enough to curtail the ACA's Medicaid expansion and that it largely leaves the ACA's insurance coverage mandates in place. Trump and his deputies have spent the past several days carefully wooing members of the Freedom Caucus with lengthy lunches with the president, calls with staff and friendly meetings with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, himself a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. Yet it remains unclear when or how any tweaks to the measure would occur. Trump and Ryan have both sent strong signals this week that they consider the tax credit issue settled, and several Freedom Caucus members said they were now focused on beefing up the GOP bill's attack on the ACA insurance mandates. House leaders involved in drafting the bill largely steered clear of the insurance mandates, having concluded that more significant changes would be more difficult to get through the Senate. But conservatives said they were not interested in watering down the House bill preemptively. "I think we can probably be more aggressive," said Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. "So I think that's what [Meadows and Jordan] were talking to the president about, saying, 'Mr. President, if you want to reduce costs, this may not do it.' " Another influential House conservative group, the Republican Study Committee, proposed amendments to the Medicaid portion of the GOP plan that would wind down the ACA Medicaid expansion beginning in 2018 rather than 2020, and also require "able-bodied, childless adults" to seek work in exchange for Medicaid benefits. Trump's willingness to negotiate - expressed in a Wednesday evening meeting with leaders of conservative activist groups in addition to Thursday's session with Freedom Caucus leaders - came amid a barrage of attacks from Democrats and criticism from health-care industry groups. Folders containing amendments to the GOP's "Obamacare" replacement bill are spread on a conference table in Washington on March 9, 2017, as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee worked through the night. Folders containing amendments to the GOP's "Obamacare" replacement bill are spread on a conference table in Washington on March 9, 2017, as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee worked through the night. Trump sought to calm fears about the process in an afternoon tweet: "Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!" The accelerated pace has drawn criticism from Democrats, who contrasted it with the lengthy deliberations that took place before passage of the Affordable Care Act, as well as from some Republicans. One of those Republicans, Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.), tweeted early Thursday morning that the House should "start over." "Get it right, don't get it fast," Cotton wrote from his political account. In a Thursday afternoon interview with The Washington Post, Cotton threw more cold water on the House legislation, including the proposed tax credits to help people pay for insurance. "The bill that was introduced Monday night cannot pass the Senate," he said. "And I don't think it will be brought to the Senate for a vote." Cotton said many of his colleagues hold similar views: "They might not have spoken publicly about it, but I can tell you a number if not a majority of Republican senators think that this process has been too breakneck, too slapdash and they do not see a good solution for the American people coming out of the House bill as drafted." Four other GOP senators in states that accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA, also known as Obamacare, have expressed concerns about changing the way the program is administered. One of those senators, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, reiterated his concerns Thursday after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. "That concerns me if it provides less certainty for the expanded Medicaid," Portman said. "We'll see." The immediate challenge for Trump, however, is getting the legislation through the House, and lawmakers said his meeting Thursday with its most vocal conservative critics showed he is taking a hands-on approach. "We're appealing to a president who likes to negotiate, who likes to win, and who likes to keep his promises," said Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, a Freedom Caucus member. The Freedom Caucus huddled for more than an hour at the Capitol Thursday after Meadows and the other lawmakers returned from their White House lunch to whittle down a final list of demands. House GOP leadership faced mounting opposition Tuesday after introducing an Obamacare repeal and replace bill that was rejected by small government conservatives, panned by Republican moderates and given only lukewarm support from President Trump.

One day after unveiling the GOP’s long-promised... Meanwhile, the American Action Network, a group with close ties to Ryan, said it would launch television ads in more than two dozen media markets urging intransigent conservatives to support the plan. Many House conservatives said they have yet to be swayed. Several said they worry that the White House and Ryan are sending completely different messages about how much influence rank-and-file members will have over the final health care law. "What we hear from the White House is, this is a work in progress," said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C. "Then we hear from leadership, take it or leave it." Several members said they're concerned that promised administrative actions to scale back expensive essential health benefits mandated by the ACA - such as birth control, maternity care and free preventative care - will never materialize if voters balk at the changes. "Given his sensitivity to public opinion, you're telling me he's going to make that tough call?" Sanford said. "And, if not, we're going to own it." The Washington Post's Elise Viebeck and David Weigel contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare Bill." At his daily news briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer specifically said that the proposal was "the Obamacare replacement plan that everyone has been asking for, the plan that the president ran on." If this is the plan that Trump ran on, his voters might be surprised to hear it. Preliminary analysis suggests that Trump's base of support is more likely to see insurance premium costs rise -- often substantially -- under Trump's bill. When we talk about the core of Trump's support, we're talking largely about white working-class voters. Nearly 9 in 10 Trump voters were white, and his support was larger among those who had lower incomes and were older. Among white voters younger than 30, Trump won by four percentage points nationally, according to exit polling. Among those ages 45 to 64, he won by 28. Income worked in the reverse direction. Those making $250,000 or more a year backed Trump by five points. Those making $50,000 to $99,999 annually supported him by 28. Shortly after the policy was announced, AARP sent a letter to congressional leaders offering the organization's unqualified opposition to the policy as written. "Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access health care," the letter reads. "A typical senior seeking coverage through an exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for health care." It offered estimates of how the Obamacare replacement bill might affect older Americans. (Note that the figures below relate to those seeking insurance on an exchange -- that is, not through an employer.) Kathy Watson was anxious about her health coverage even before she woke up gasping for breath last month and drove herself to the emergency room with a flare-up in her heart condition. After struggling for years without insurance, the 55-year-old former small-business owner — who has battled diabetes,... Kathy Watson was anxious about her health coverage even before she woke up gasping for breath last month and drove herself to the emergency room with a flare-up in her heart condition. After struggling for years without insurance, the 55-year-old former small-business owner — who has battled diabetes,... "We estimate that the bill's changes to current law's tax credits" - the subsidies provided by the government to reduce the cost of insurance - "could increase premium costs for a 55-year old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-year old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000," it says. That's an increase of 9 percent of the 55-year-old's annual income and 39 percent of the annual income of that 64-year-old earning 15,000 a year. When the analysts combined changes to the tax credits with a proposal to expand ratio of costs relative to younger recipients from 3 to 1 to 5 to 1, the figures were worse. In that case, "taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year." The Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking the effects of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) since its inception, put together an interactive tool showing how tax credits might change. If you're a 40-year-old making $75,000 a year, you're going to get a 75 percent or higher increase to your tax credits -- a beneficial situation for you. President Donald Trump said Friday that his predecessor's health care law covers "very few people," as he minimized the impact of replacing it. That's only true if you consider more than 20 million people to be very few. Here's a look at his statement at the Conservative Political Action Conference... President Donald Trump said Friday that his predecessor's health care law covers "very few people," as he minimized the impact of replacing it. That's only true if you consider more than 20 million people to be very few. Here's a look at his statement at the Conservative Political Action Conference... If, however, you're a 60-year-old making $30,000 a year, you're going to see a reduction in those tax credits (unless you live in upstate New York or Massachusetts or parts of central Texas). For example, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - states central to Trump's electoral victory - will have their credits decrease. The general trend is clear. "Generally," the Foundation writes, "people who are older, lower-income, or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive larger tax credits under the ACA than they would under the American Health Care Act replacement." Beyond the fact that voters more likely to have supported Trump are also more likely to see cost increases, there's a political hazard here for everyone else, too. AARP, representing retirees, also represents the voting bloc most likely to head to the polls regularly, including in off-year elections. If the House plan presses forward, the negative effects could be weighted more heavily toward the people who will be most likely to vote in the November 2018 midterm elections. That poses some hazards for Republican champions of the bill. If the legislation's first day in the wild is any indication, though, we can assume that the version that finally receives a vote on the House floor -- assuming a version does -- may look substantially different from the version being assessed at the moment. It has received a slew of negative responses from across the political spectrum, making it hard to see how the current bill could be passed. At some point, too, Trump may want to set aside his desire to have a quick win on a "repeal" of health care in favor of a policy that's less likely to distribute the pain of the shift to his core base of support. The hallmark of Trump's base has been its loyalty, with Trump once bragging that he could shoot someone dead in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stick by him. Possibly. But they may be less forgiving if Trump signs a bill into law that negatively affects their own personal health, middle of the street or not.

Major associations representing physicians, hospitals, insurers and seniors all leveled sharp attacks against the House GOP's plan to rewrite the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, as some Republicans publicly questioned whether the measure can clear the House of Representatives. While industry groups warned that the proposal could leave vulnerable Americans with fewer protections than they now have, GOP leaders pressed ahead, bringing legislation before two key committees that are expected to approve the bills by week's end. They were also working in concert with the White House to win over conservatives, who have complained that the proposal preserves too much of the current law. The flurry of activity — including an evening meeting between President Donald Trump and leaders from five skeptical conservative groups — created new uncertainty about the viability of Republicans' signature promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The day's events also showed the uneasy predicament facing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the proposal's chief booster, who described the plan Wednesday as a "conservative wish list" that would deliver on years of GOP campaign promises to change the nation's health-care system. "Right now I feel confident saying there aren't 218 votes for this," said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who was referring to the number of votes needed to pass the measure out of the House. Perry opposes the proposal. The barrage of criticism shows how fraught the terrain of health-care policy is. It also reflects a backlash prompted at least partly by the breakneck speed with which House Republicans are trying to push through their proposal — with little upfront effort to work with interest groups or political factions. "What we're seeing now is that the political prospects for repealing the Affordable Care Act are as daunting as the effort to pass national health reform," Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs, said in an interview. President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... House Republican leaders have given little indication that they will make anything but marginal changes to their plan, which would eliminate the requirements that all Americans obtain coverage or pay a tax penalty and that businesses with at least 50 employees provide insurance. The American Health Care Act would replace income-based subsidies with refundable tax credits based on age and income, charge individuals a 30 percent surcharge if they buy a plan after allowing their coverage to lapse and phase out the law's more generous Medicaid funding over time. While conservatives complained that these changes don't go far enough, they have sparked criticism not just from Democrats but from moderate Republicans, AARP, the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association. "We cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations," James Madara, chief executive of the American Medical Association and a doctor, wrote in a letter to committee leaders overseeing work on the bill. Richard Pollack, CEO of the American Hospital Association, voiced similar fears, saying efforts to "restructure the Medicaid program" by shifting it from an entitlement program to one based on a per capita allocation "will have the effect of making significant reductions in a program that provides services for our most vulnerable populations and already pays providers significantly less than the cost of providing care." America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest trade association, sent a letter Wednesday saying that while it appreciated several of the proposed changes, the changes to Medicaid "could result in unnecessary disruptions in the coverage and care beneficiaries depend on." House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., told reporters Wednesday that critics were exaggerating the proposal's potential repercussions. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... "It's tough to do entitlement reform, it's tough to make these changes, but I think at the end of day, seniors are going to be fine," Walden said. "If you're on Medicaid today, you'll be on Medicaid tomorrow. States can intercede here and help out. So there's more to this story." Walden said it was "sort of shocking" that hospital groups were strongly opposing the plan, because the GOP legislation restores the ACA's cuts to "disproportionate share" payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of uninsured patients. "There's a pretty big medical-industrial complex in America," he added. "And when you touch it, I've discovered, it touches back." House Republicans' determination to deliver on their promise to undo the ACA — Ryan said Wednesday that it is "the covenant we made with the American people when we ran on a repeal-and-replace plan in 2016" — has spurred a legislative drive that is happening at warp speed. A cadre of lawmakers and staffers worked behind closed doors for several weeks to draft the pair of bills, which were designed to move through the annual budget process in order to clear the Senate with a simple majority vote. But that process, which did not involve an extended period of negotiation with interest groups or consultation with Democrats, has produced a furious backlash. Some insurers, including Molina Healthcare and the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said they did not get to offer any input into the House proposal. "It doesn't seem like the industry got any heads-up or was involved. We definitely were not," Sunny Yu, spokeswoman for Molina Healthcare, which has about a million members in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, said in an email. Democrats threw up procedural obstacles Wednesday in the committee meetings and on the House floor, complaining that it was irresponsible to consider the bills before the Congressional Budget Office offered an analysis that showed the legislation's impact on the budget and Americans' overall health care coverage. "We need to know, what this is going to cost?" asked Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. "We need to know, what kind of health insurance is going to be feasible?" Both House Republicans and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney have predicted that they will have a CBO "score" ready by early next week, before the bills are combined and brought before the House Budget Committee. GOP staffers noted that other health care bills, including the 21st Century Cures Act and the 2015 reauthorization bill for Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, began their journeys through congressional committees without a CBO score. Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee moved to delay the bill's consideration for 30 days, while those on Ways and Means moved to delay it for one week to allow for further hearings and to examine the CBO report. Both motions were voted down on a straight party-line vote, and the panels continued working into the evening. Still, the most imminent threat GOP leaders must contend with comes from the far right. The speaker can lose only 21 Republican votes if the American Health Care Act is to pass, and opponents are promising to use that leverage to force changes to the bill. Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va., a freshman member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he was confident that his camp could help reshape the legislation. While Trump had endorsed it already, Garrett said, he would probably be willing to accept something else if it were changed in a way conservatives could support. "This is a guy who said he wasn't sure that NATO, in its classic role, is necessary — and then two months later we saw countries like Germany vow to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP," said Garrett. "Why'd they do that? Because Donald Trump wasn't going to accept the status quo. They made a counteroffer. Right now, there's an offer, and he's saying he likes to get people to make counteroffers."

House GOP leadership faced mounting opposition Tuesday after introducing an Obamacare repeal and replace bill that was rejected by small government conservatives, panned by Republican moderates and given only lukewarm support from President Trump. One day after unveiling the GOP’s long-promised... Vice President Mike Pence met with two House Freedom Caucus leaders Tuesday, and that same day Mulvaney — a former caucus member — spent more than an hour at a meeting of the group. Its members have been invited to visit the White House next Tuesday. Wednesday night, Trump met with leaders from Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, the Heritage Foundation and its political arm, Heritage Action, and the Tea Party Patriots. But the hard reality for Republicans is that any changes made to appease House conservatives could threaten the bill's support among moderates. "My fear is that the bill will go backwards," said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group who has gotten White House attention of his own: He met Tuesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. "If the bill starts going in the reverse direction in order to satisfy certain members of my party, then I'm going to have a problem. I think the federal government has a role to play here, and I'm not looking to just see the federal government undermine the health care needs of the American people." Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a pivotal Republican moderate, said in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo News' Katie Couric that the current House measure would "not be well received in the Senate" and stood no chance of passing as is. "I want us to slow down to take more time to be sure we get this right." The Washington Post's David Weigel, Carolyn Johnson, Elise Viebeck and Amy Goldstein contributed.

House Republicans' plans to dismantle core parts of the Affordable Care Act would provide more government help for Americans to buy health insurance than some conservatives want, but the assistance would take a sharply different form, with clear winners and losers. The architecture of the tax credits in the legislation, which House committees are to begin debating Wednesday morning, would offer less help to lower-income Americans than the subsidies provided by the current law. It would steer more money to young adults at the expense of older ones. And it would most benefit consumers living in states in which insurance prices already are relatively low. Such on-the-ground implications began to emerge Tuesday, as health-policy analysts, economists and interest groups absorbed the details of what House GOP leaders hope to do - and not do - to fulfill their long-standing pledge to redirect the nation's health policies in a more conservative direction. The House GOP is moving so fast - with debate starting in the Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee less than 48 hours after they unveiled their bills - that lawmakers have not yet received any estimates from congressional budget analysts of how much the plans would cost or, significantly, how many Americans could be expected to gain or lose insurance coverage. Still, the plans' tax credits and other elements that would change the insurance landscape have enabled analysts and policy specialists from different ideological perspectives to start forecasting the effects. The GOP health care legislation, the first such bill that House Republican leaders have produced, would eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars of federal aid that has allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to millions of previously uninsured people. The GOP health care legislation, the first such bill that House Republican leaders have produced, would eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars of federal aid that has allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to millions of previously uninsured people. An analysis by S&P Global predicts the legislation would lead to a loss of coverage for 2 million to 4 million of the roughly 16 million Americans who bought their own health plans through the ACA's marketplaces or separately. More adults 35 and younger would gain coverage, while fewer adults 45 and older would be insured, according to the analysis. Such patterns would arise from subtle but significant differences between the ACA's subsidies and the way the GOP legislation's features would work, said Deep Banerjee, an S&P Global director. Specifically, the current subsidies take into account the cost of insurance in a given area, and they are linked to premiums for the next-to-lowest "silver" health plan - the second rung among four ACA tiers that supply different levels of coverage. Under House Republicans' plans, those tiers would disappear and the tax credits would no longer vary depending on geography. As a result, the largest credits, $4,000 for people 60 and older, would cover more than half the typical insurance premiums in New Mexico, for example, but less than a third of the cost in Wyoming, Banerjee said. The GOP plans also would undo an ACA rule that allows insurers to charge their oldest customers no more than three times what they charge their youngest and healthiest ones. Instead, insurers could charge five times as much. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... "Obamacare was specifically calibrated to cross-subsidize the older and sicker patients," said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere, a Washington-based health consulting group. The GOP approach "basically moves back in the direction of a less regulated market." AARP, the influential lobby for older Americans, has already begun pushing back. David Certner, AARP's legislative counsel, said the group is particularly concerned about the effect on Americans ages 50 to 64 if that age-charge differential is to increase. Low-income Americans in that older group would "get hammered," he said. For a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year, Certner said, the combined change in subsidy and premium would be about $8,394. For a 55-year-old earning $25,000, it would be $3,636. "We think those numbers are pretty dramatic," Certner said. Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said more low-income people would have a hard time affording benefits under the Republicans' American Health Care Act. "There will be more losers than winners," he said. Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a health and tax policy research organization favoring free-market approaches, agreed that for lower-income people, "there is no question [financial assistance is] going to be lower." But the GOP's version of tax credits would be more transparent, she said, enabling people to know based on their age and income exactly how much help they would get. And that, she said, would lead consumers to be more cost-minded shoppers for insurance and help hold down health plans' prices. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said he was confident the House proposal, if enacted, would translate not only into a cut in "the premiums that individuals will see but a decrease in the cost of health care for folks." Yet Rachel Bovard, director of policy services at the Heritage Foundation, criticized the GOP proposal as still being too generous with federal dollars while failing to address the main drivers of rising health costs. The biggest losers, Bovard said, would be people buying insurance on their own who voted Republicans into office so that they would "fully repeal" the ACA. "It substitutes new funding for old Obamacare funding," she argued. President Trump said Tuesday that he was “proud” to support House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, asserting that his party was committed to seeing the plan through. "Obamacare is collapsing," Trump said in remarks at the White House to Republican lawmakers responsible... President Trump said Tuesday that he was “proud” to support House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, asserting that his party was committed to seeing the plan through. "Obamacare is collapsing," Trump said in remarks at the White House to Republican lawmakers responsible... Overall, Republicans' tax credits would reach people at higher incomes than the ACA subsidies, available to people with incomes of up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level - about $47,000 for an individual or $97,000 for a family of four. The proposed credits would be available to individuals with incomes of up to $75,000 and families up to $150,000. The credits also would be available to people who have been caught in a coverage gap in the ACA - incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid in their state but too low to buy health plans on the ACA's marketplaces. Certain health care is specifically targeted by the legislation. In the House Energy and Commerce Committee bill, a provision would prohibit federal funds from being spent for one year on any family-planning clinic that "provides abortions," except in cases where the pregnancy stems from rape or incest or threatens the life of the mother. The restriction would carry out conservatives' longtime goal of cutting federal support of Planned Parenthood.

Vice President Mike Pence joined House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday in his Wisconsin hometown, promising during an invite-only speech that a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act would come within days while dismissing recent protests at Republican town halls by people opposed to repealing it. "Despite the best efforts of some activists at some town halls around the country, the American people know Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go," Pence told about 350 employees of Blain Supply at the company headquarters in Janesville. About 50 protesters jeered Pence and Ryan from across the street, waving a large flag that said "RESIST," echoing similar protests they each faced in separate stops Thursday in Ohio and Rhode Island. Ryan is working with House Republicans and the Trump administration on a repeal and replacement plan for the health care law. Pence said Trump and Ryan have a close partnership that will benefit Americans "for generations to come." Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as Indiana's governor, according to public records obtained by the Indianapolis Star.

Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican., also held an invite-only listening session with eight invited farmers and local business owners before taking a tour of the distribution center. Reporters were ushered out of the listening session after opening comments. The Wisconsin stop was the second in as many days where Pence visited a private business and touted the Trump administration's plans for replacing the federal law. He visited a picture frame manufacturer in suburban Cincinnati on Thursday. Ryan and House Republicans have been struggling to solidify support for their plans to reshape the nation's health care law, while being secretive about the details of what they're working on. Price, in his comments, said the Senate, House and administration was working together on the repeal and replacement plan. "Our goal is to make sure no one falls through the cracks in this transition," he said.

Addressing... Pence said he was consulting with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, on the health care law replacement. Pence said he was working with Walker to ensure that the plan gives states flexibility so it "will work for the people of their individual states." Walker met with Trump and Pence earlier in the week and with high profile Republicans on Thursday in Washington, urging them to follow his state's lead when overhauling the federal health care law. Walker rejected the Medicaid expansion under the federal law but made other changes to extend insurance to others so everyone below the poverty level is covered. Because of his Washington meeting, Walker was unable to attend the Pence visit in his state Friday.

Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: no one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot. President Donald Trump accepted Flynn's resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his potentially illegal conversations with a Russian envoy. In his resignation letter, Flynn blamed the "fast pace of events" surrounding the White House transition for the lapse, saying he "inadvertently" gave the officials "incomplete information." In total, he was on the job 24 days. The position was created in 1953 by President Dwight Eisenhower, and was originally titled special assistant for national security affairs. Twenty-five people have held the position since then, not including Keith Kellogg, who was tapped by Trump to fill the role while the administration looks for Flynn's replacement. President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia.

President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn... Almost every national security adviser has served for more than a year, and most longer than that. Henry Kissinger had the longest run, serving from early 1969 until late 1975. Until Flynn's resignation, William H. Jackson had the shortest. A U.S. Army intelligence officer during World War II, Jackson rose through the ranks in the nation's budding intelligence community and was eventually appointed special assistant for national security affairs in 1956. Eisenhower shuffled him out amid changes on the National Security Council just four months later, according to a White House history. It doesn't seem to have been a controversial decision at the time. "Politics was involved," he said at the time. He questioned how he could "find himself in a position where his resignation would be submitted and accepted," despite being cleared, according to a CQ Almanac report. Bud McFarlane had served a little more than two years as national security adviser when he stepped down in 1985 for what he said were personal reasons. His successor, John Poindexter, was also a key player in the Iran-contra affair. A 2009 story from the New Republic recalls a trip the two men made to Iran when McFarlane was still in the position: "As Ronald Reagan's national security adviser, he embarked on a secret mission to Tehran -- which he and his future successor, John Poindexter, had promoted in the White House -- bearing a chocolate cake topped with a brass key (meant to symbolize a 'new opening'), a crate of missile parts, and a Bible signed by the president. The ultimate result was the arms-for-hostages deal that almost destroyed Reagan's presidency and earned McFarlane multiple charges of withholding information from Congress." Following McFarlane, Poindexter resigned in 1986 after just 356 days as national security adviser, marking one of the shortest stints in the position. He was also convicted in connection with the scandal, but the convictions were reversed on appeal. Others have had more success. Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all had national security advisers who served three years or more. Compared to some of their predecessors, they were generally scandal-free.

Michael Flynn's resignation as Donald Trump's national security adviser late Monday night proves that even for this most unorthodox of presidents some of the old rules of Washington politics still apply. Flynn -- and the broader Trump administration -- had been on defense for the last five days... Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Gerald Ford and the elder Bush, is often referred to as the "gold standard" for the position. As The Washington Post's Karen DeYoung reported in 2015, Scowcroft is renowned for running a tight ship and keeping a low profile. "Somehow he managed to get the difficult balance right: representing the view of others, ensuring due process, and providing honest and wise counsel to the President," Council on Foreign Relations President Richard N. Haass wrote of Scowcroft in 2012. "I used to tease him that was only because he got to do the job for two different Presidents and had the chance to learn from his own mistakes. The real reason, though, is that Brent brought to the job both strength of character and strength of intellect." Flynn had a decorated career in public service. Flynn claimed not to have discussed U.S. sanctions against Moscow with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, leading the Trump administrations to falsely defend his actions. Pressure on Flynn boiled over Monday after The Post reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn had mischaracterized his communications with Kislyak to such a degree that he might be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.

Michael Flynn's resignation as Donald Trump's national security adviser late Monday night proves that even for this most unorthodox of presidents some of the old rules of Washington politics still apply. Flynn -- and the broader Trump administration -- had been on defense for the last five days in the wake of a Washington Post report that Flynn had discussed recently-imposed economic sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak despite repeatedly denying having done so. Flynn's denied it on the record to the Post and, more damaging for him, to Vice President Mike Pence, who went on a Sunday show to assert that the sanctions had never come up in Flynn's conversations with the Russians. Talk of Flynn's future dominated this weekend's political talk shows and the Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal all ran stories raising questions about Flynn's ability to survive on Monday. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC Monday afternoon that Flynn "enjoys the full confidence" of Trump. Shortly after, White House press secretary Sean Spicer seemed to contradict Conway, insisting that Trump was evaluating Flynn's future. Hours later, Flynn was gone. What's remarkable about the Flynn saga was how incredibly routine it was. A deeply damaging story comes out. The White House goes into bunker mode. Conflicting reports from conflicting aides emerge. And then, whammo: Resignation. It was a prototypical Washington scandal that played out like hundreds of similar ones before it. It felt, dare I say it, normal. Normal is worth noting in a presidency -- and an administration -- that has been anything but in its first 24 days. With Conway's statement Monday afternoon, it seemed as though Trump would again zig against the zag of conventional wisdom and keep Flynn on -- refusing to give into pressure from the political establishment and national media that he so reviles. But, Trump does value Pence. And understands that Pence helps him in Washington and with the broader Republican party. And, although Flynn had apologized to Pence for misremembering -- ahem -- whether he talked about sanctions with Kisylak, Pence was still stung by the whole episode. Making Pence happy -- and dispatching with a constant drip-drip-drip of negative headlines -- trumped Trump's loyalty to Flynn. (Flynn was one of Trump's favored surrogates and often introduced the president on the campaign trail.) What's remarkable about the whole episode is how unremarkable it actually is. The cover-up is worse than the crime. Embarrassing the big bosses has major ramifications. Sacrificial lambs must be offered. The Flynn resignation had all of the beats of a traditional Washington drama. That made it unique for this White House.

President Donald Trump is "evaluating the situation" regarding his embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn's conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., the White House said Monday, deepening the uncertainty surrounding Flynn's future in the new administration. Flynn apologized privately for the controversy to Vice President Mike Pence, according to a White House official. Pence, relying on information from Flynn, publicly vouched that the retired Army lieutenant general did not discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia in calls with the Russia late last year. Flynn has since told the White House that sanctions may have come up. Trump, who comments on a steady stream of issues on his Twitter feed, has been conspicuously silent about the matter since The Washington Post reported last week that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy. A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition. Earlier Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn, though her assertions were not backed up by other senior Trump aides. Flynn sat in the front row of Trump's news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier Monday. But the president did not receive a question about Flynn's future from a pair of reporters, and he ignored journalists' shouted follow-up inquiries as he left the room. Trump has told associates he is troubled by the situation, but he has not said whether he plans to ask Flynn to step down, according to a person who spoke with him recently. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he is viewed skeptically by some in the administration's national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia. White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is under increasing political pressure and risks losing the confidence of some colleagues following reports that he misled senior administration officials about his discussion of sanctions with a Russian envoy shortly before President Trump took... White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is under increasing political pressure and risks losing the confidence of some colleagues following reports that he misled senior administration officials about his discussion of sanctions with a Russian envoy shortly before President Trump took... In 2015, Flynn was paid to attend a gala dinner for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed television station, and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the event. Flynn spoke with the vice president about the matter twice on Friday, according to an administration official. The official said Pence was relying on information from Flynn when he went on television and denied that sanctions were discussed with Kislyak. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said that if Pence were misled, "I can't imagine he would have trust in Gen. Flynn going forward." She said it would also be "troubling" if Flynn had been negotiating with a foreign government before taking office. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for Flynn to be fired, saying he "cannot be trusted to put Putin before America." It's illegal for private citizens to conduct U.S. diplomacy. Flynn's conversations also raise questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow hacked Democratic emails during the election. National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. Flynn's... National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. Flynn's... The controversy surrounding Flynn comes as the young administration grapples with a series of national security challenges, including North Korea's reported ballistic missile launch. The president, who was joined at his Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, voiced solidarity with Japan. The White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump's immigration executive order, which has been blocked by the courts. The order was intended to suspend the nation's refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Flynn's contacts with Kislyak coincided with the Obama administration slapping penalties on Russia for election-related hacking. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia hacked Democratic groups to help Trump win the election. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who led Trump's transition planning before the election, said Flynn would have to explain his conflicting statements about his conversations with Kislyak to Trump and Pence. "Gen. Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador. I think now he's saying that he doesn't remember whether he did or not," Christie said on CNN. "So, that's a conversation he is going to need to have with the president and the vice president to clear that up, so that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on." Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire in New York and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.

After a tumultuous campaign and transition, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Friday as the least popular incoming president in at least four decades, but a majority of Americans nevertheless express optimism that he will be able to fulfill campaign pledges to boost the economy and deal with threats of terrorism, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. Amid controversy and calls for additional investigations into possible Russian interference in the election, most Americans disapprove of Trump's response to the hacking and other activities. But they are divided on the question of whether the president-elect has been too friendly toward Russia or taken the right approach in his public comments and posture. On ethical matters, a bare majority say the steps Trump and his attorney outlined last week to turn over control of his sprawling business enterprise to his children create adequate separation while he serves as president. But the public is split almost evenly on whether he and his family are fully complying with federal ethics laws, and an overwhelming majority say he should release his federal tax returns, which he has long declined to do. Trump, predictably, dismissed the poll results as "rigged" on Twitter on Tuesday morning. The Post-ABC survey offers a starting point and a measuring stick for a Trump presidency. As in the campaign, Trump is a polarizing figure who generates great enthusiasm among those who supported him and deep hostility among those who did not. Attitudes toward Trump, along with deep partisan divisions that predated his candidacy, provide the backdrop for Friday's ceremonies at the Capitol and the opening days of the 45th president's tenure. Trump tweeted recently about the divisions and anger that have marked the politics of the country and, noting that many Americans say little can be done to change it, declared in capital letters that "it will change." The new survey underscores the challenges that await him as he attempts to make good on that statement. But it also highlights the mixed emotions many Americans bring to a Trump presidency. On the eve of his inauguration, 44 percent of Americans say they believe Trump is qualified to serve as president, compared with 52 percent who say he is not. The good news for Trump is that the 52 percent figure is the lowest since he became a candidate. Over 8 in 10 Republicans say he is qualified, and about the same percentage of Democrats say he is not. Independents are almost evenly divided on the question. Trump will enter the Oval Office on Friday with his image upside down. Just 40 percent say they have a favorable impression of him, and 54 percent view him unfavorably -- with 41 percent saying they have a strongly unfavorable impression of him. That's starkly different from current views of President Barack Obama, whose favorable rating is at 61 percent. Compared with other presidents, Trump's handling of the transition has been judged harshly by respondents. As with his favorable rating, 40 percent say they approve and 54 percent disapprove. In comparison, roughly 8 in 10 approved of the way Obama and former presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush handled their transitions. And about 7 in 10 approved of the way former president George W. Bush handled his, even though it came amid the rancorous 37-day recount of ballots in Florida and a controversial Supreme Court decision that helped put him in the Oval Office. Independents have not rallied behind Trump, as has consistently been the case for past presidents. But another reason for Trump's lower-than-average numbers is that some segments of his political base are less enthusiastic than might be expected. Only 56 percent of conservatives give him positive marks on the transition, and only 62 percent say they have a favorable impression of him. Trump fares unfavorably compared with other incoming presidents on public judgments about the men and women he has selected to serve in his Cabinet and other top-level posts. For Obama, both Bushes and Clinton, nearly 6 in 10 or more approved of most personnel choices. For Trump, it's just 4 in 10, with 48 percent saying they disapprove of most of his nominees. The transition has been dominated by the intelligence community's report that concluded the Russians were responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee and the private email of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, with the goal of helping Trump. The Post-ABC poll finds that 64 percent of Americans believe that Russia was responsible for hacking Clinton campaign emails, and 45 percent think they intended to boost Trump. More than 8 in 10 Democrats polled say the Russians were responsible, with three-quarters of all Democrats saying they believe that the Russians sought to undermine Clinton and aid Trump. Not quite half of the Republicans say the Russians were behind what happened, with about 1 in 5 saying they think the goal was to help the president-elect. The outgoing CIA director charged on Sunday that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. John Brennan's... The outgoing CIA director charged on Sunday that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. John Brennan's... There are similar partisan divisions on Trump's approach to the Russians. More than two in three Democrats say he's being too cozy in his treatment of Russia, and 3 in 4 Republicans say his posture has been about right -- that from a party whose leaders have historically shown significant hostility toward that country. By 54 to 34 percent, more Americans disapprove of Trump's overall response to the issue of Russian hacking, according to the survey, with Republicans less united in approval than Democrats are in opposition. So far, Trump has generated little confidence about his ability to make sound decisions as president. When asked generally about their faith in his decision-making, just under 4 in 10 say they have either a "great deal" or a "good amount" of confidence in him, and about 6 in 10 say they have "just some" or "none at all." That is the mirror opposite of attitudes eight years ago on the eve of Obama's first inauguration. On individual issues, however, the picture is strikingly different. Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again," has generated hope among many Americans that on economic issues at least he will be able to do just that. Roughly 6 in 10 say they expect the New York businessman to do an excellent or good job in handling the economy and creating jobs. He has said repeatedly that both will be top priorities of his presidency. At the same time, he stressed his determination to defeat ISIS and protect the country against threats of terrorism. The Post-ABC survey found that 56 percent of Americans say they think he will do a good or excellent job on that front. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to clog the nation's capital for Donald Trump's inauguration and a major demonstration the day after, but how many will actually arrive to party or protest is an open question. Officials estimate that 800,000 to 900,000 people will be present Friday... Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to clog the nation's capital for Donald Trump's inauguration and a major demonstration the day after, but how many will actually arrive to party or protest is an open question. Officials estimate that 800,000 to 900,000 people will be present Friday... On other issues, the outlook is less positive. The public appears about evenly divided on whether Trump will do well or not well in his nominations to the Supreme Court. Half of all Americans express optimism about how he will handle the federal budget deficit and help the middle class. Slightly more than half have negative views about how he will handle an international crisis and whether he can improve the health care system. His lowest ratings come on two issues that have been controversial since he first announced his candidacy in the summer of 2015: race relations and handling issues of concern to women. Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they do not think he will do a good job on race relations. Those opinions came on a weekend in which Trump clashed with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the civil rights icon who had told NBC's Chuck Todd that he did not regard Trump as a legitimate president because of Russian interference in the election. Meanwhile, just over 6 in 10 say they do not think he will do a good job dealing with issues of special concern to women. Trump's policy agenda draws mixed assessments in terms of support or opposition. On immigration, for example, 6 in 10 Americans oppose his call for building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, one of the signature initiatives of his campaign. But over 7 in 10 support his call to deport roughly 2 million undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime. That policy would not mark a major policy shift, as the Obama administration deported at least 2.7 million immigrants, focusing on those with criminal convictions. His inauguration days away, President-elect Donald Trump is continuing to lash out at critics in the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress who are vowing to skip his swearing-in ceremony.

His inauguration days away, President-elect Donald Trump is continuing to lash out at critics in the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress who are vowing to skip his swearing-in ceremony. The tough-talking Republican questioned whether the CIA director himself was "the leaker of fake... Majorities oppose his campaign recommendation to ban most Muslims who are not U.S. citizens from entering the country or the possibility of having the United States withdraw from the international treaty addressing climate change. A plurality of Americans say they oppose withdrawing from the nuclear agreement with Iran. Americans are closely divided on repealing the Affordable Care Act, 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed, according to the survey. Two-thirds of repeal supporters say this should not occur before a replacement is created. Congressional Republicans have already started the process to do so. Trump has said he wants a replacement to coincide with repeal and told The Washington Post over the weekend that his plan will mean "insurance for everybody." Trump's plan to incentivize private infrastructure spending may also run against public opinion. Nearly two-thirds of respondents oppose spending nearly $140 billion dollars to encourage private construction of roads and other transportation projects if companies could then charge people tolls for using them.

Where Trump finds support is on some of his economic initiatives. The Post-ABC poll finds small majorities support both his call to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and taking punitive action against companies that shift jobs from the United States to other countries. On taxes, majorities of Americans support cuts for the middle class and those with lower incomes and oppose cuts for higher-income taxpayers, while the public is split about evenly over cutting business taxes. Trump has often clashed with the media, during the campaign and during the transition. Asked how they viewed media treatment of Trump, 49 percent of the public says he was treated fairly and 47 percent said unfairly, with Democrats and Republicans taking sharply opposing positions. On how Trump is treating the news media, the findings were different, with 57 percent saying he is treating the media unfairly, compared with 38 percent saying fairly. A significant majority of Republicans, however, say Trump is treating the press fairly. One pattern first seen during the presidential campaign continues to shape attitudes as Trump prepares to become president, which is a division among white Americans based on levels of education. In general, on a series of questions in the new poll, whites without college degrees expressed considerably more support for Trump than whites with college degrees. This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone January 12-15, 2017, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults, including landline and cellphone respondents. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Judge James Robart wore a bow tie to the hearing, opened with a joke and finished with a thunderclap. He was known for that sort of thing. "The amicus law professors," Robart said Friday, noting the many groups that waited in his Seattle courtroom to argue for or against a motion to halt President Donald Trump's travel ban. "Sounds like the three amigos." People laughed, despite the tension. The federal judge had a habit of mixing soft speech and extraordinary pronouncements. At the end of the hearing, with no jokes or spare words; Robart halted Trump's ban and potentially changed the fate of citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and tens of thousands of refugees, who had been denied entry into the United States. His order challenges a White House that had spent all week defending the travel ban. "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" Trump said in a tweet Saturday morning. But Robart has been called judge for more than a decade. President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal court for Washington state's western district court in 2004, choosing him from a shortlist of nominees selected by a bipartisan commission. Although he had held no judgeship before, senators of both parties praised Robart. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., introduced him to the judiciary committee as a man who had fostered six children with his wife. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., went over Robart's 30 years as a lawyer - up to his work at the time as managing partner at a Seattle law firm. Robart graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1973. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted Robart's "representation of the disadvantaged" - including his work representing "southeast Asian refugees." Asked about such work at his confirmation hearing, Robart gave a short speech about fairness in the courtroom. "I was introduced to people who, in many times, felt that the legal system was stacked against them or was unfair," Robart told the senators. "Working with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law." "Well, thank you," Hatch said. "That is a great answer." Late Friday night, some of President Donald Trump's top advisers huddled on the phone to craft a response to a court ruling that blocked the White House's refugee and immigration ban. The White House statement slammed the order as "outrageous." But the president's lawyers quickly raised objections... Late Friday night, some of President Donald Trump's top advisers huddled on the phone to craft a response to a court ruling that blocked the White House's refugee and immigration ban. The White House statement slammed the order as "outrageous." But the president's lawyers quickly raised objections... No one opposed his confirmation. In his 13 years on the federal bench, the judge handed down criminal sentences no lighter than the law recommended - 78 months in prison for a crack dealer, life for a man who murdered a woman on a Native American reservation two decades earlier. His job as a federal judge got more complicated after Seattle police fatally shot John Williams - a partially deaf woodcarver who did not put down his carving knife one day in 2010. Hundreds surrounded a Seattle police station to protest Williams' death, which had followed other accusations of police brutality in the city. A Justice Department investigation "found routine and widespread use of excessive force by officers," the Seattle Times reported. That led to settlements and lawsuits - the bow-tied Robart presiding. "Well, there certainly are a lot of you," he said in August. His tie was green, his beard as white as ever. In the years since Williams' death, the Seattle case had evolved from passionate protests and a federal investigation into a string of hearings to oversee police reforms. August's hearing was one of many, and Robart gave no indication at the beginning that it would be anything of special note. He listened to each side, as he had many times before. When it was his turn to speak, he went over schedules, comments and consent decrees to come. Then he took a deep breath. "I will now step back from my very precise legal practice and give you the following observation - from me," he said. The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Donald Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers... The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge's orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Donald Trump's controversial entry ban, and the fast-moving legal dispute over the president's powers could land at the nation's highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers... He spoke of the police - their training and accountability and leadership. "The men and women who go out and walk around Seattle and proudly wear the Seattle Police Department uniform," he said, " . . . are entitled to know what they may and may not do." He breathed in again. Then he spoke of protests against police that had spread across the country, and FBI statistics showing that black people are twice as likely to be shot dead by police as their share of the population would warrant. "Black lives matter," the judge said. His words, the Seattle Times noted, caused "a startled, audible reaction" in the courtroom. Here was a federal judge echoing a slogan used by protesters. Robart was not done. "Black people are not alone in this," he went on. "Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans are also involved. And lastly and importantly: Police deaths in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Minneapolis and let's not forget Lakewood, Washington, remind us of the importance of what we are doing." If his words were extraordinary, he gave no indication that day. Robart thanked everyone before him "for your hard work" and walked out the door behind him. "It was an interesting message to the community from a white Republican federal judge," said Mike McKay, a former U.S. attorney who used to partner with Robart in private practice, and has known him throughout his legal career. "It's pretty clear what he was trying to do: show I'm listening and sensitive to all parties." Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries who were turned away from the United States due to President Donald Trump's travel ban are rushing to try again, hoping to make it through a narrow window opened by legal challenges. The federal appeals court in San Francisco denied Trump's effort... Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries who were turned away from the United States due to President Donald Trump's travel ban are rushing to try again, hoping to make it through a narrow window opened by legal challenges. The federal appeals court in San Francisco denied Trump's effort... McKay co-chaired the bipartisan committee that put Robart on a shortlist in 2003, when Bush chose him to become a federal judge. His Democratic co-chair, Jenny Durkan, agreed with McKay's take on the judge. "If you were to typecast a conservative Republican judge, it would look a lot like Judge Robart," said Durkan, who became a U.S. attorney after Robart joined the federal bench and argued before him in the Seattle hearings. "I've felt Judge Robart's wrath and also had rulings that went my way," she said. "He's going to make the ruling he thinks is the right ruling and not worry about who disagrees with him -- even the president of the United States." Half a year after Robart's "black lives matter" speech, a president did just that. Robart listened for nearly an hour to arguments of the federal government and to those who oppose its travel ban, then thanked everyone for their "thoughtful" remarks. He tried to tamp down any anticipation. A judge's job, Robart said, "is not to judge the wisdom of any policy," but only whether it was legal. He would not even do that at the moment, he said, but merely consider whether Trump's order should be blocked temporarily to prevent "immediate and irreparable injury" to the people it affects. Robart looked down at his papers and issued his order. The travel ban must be halted not just in Washington state, he said, but for all "federal defendants and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and persons acting in concert ... at all U.S. borders and port of entry, pending further order from this court." Robart did not bluster or make speeches. He promised to help the government file a speedy appeal to his decision, then collected his papers and recessed.

The Saturday evening march began at Trump Plaza, a high-rise apartment building President Donald Trump hasn't actually owned since 1991. Fine. It still has the name. It was a good place to start. From there, the marchers headed south, walking along the Intracoastal Waterway that separates West Palm Beach from ritzy Palm Beach island. They stopped shortly after 7 p.m. when they reached the bridge across from Mar-a-Lago. They brought signs and glow sticks to wave, hoping they would be visible across the dark water and the great green lawn of the club from up in the private apartment that is now the "winter White House." If Trump sees those green lights, he'll know that his critics have followed him home. "He likes to think that everybody loves him. We're showing him that we don't," said Lisa Wright, 53, an IT consultant from Broward County who was marching along the waterway Saturday night. Around 7:30 p.m., about 200 of the 1,200 marchers made it across the bridge to the back gates of Mar-a-Lago. Across the street, a few dozen pro-Trump people waved American flags, but the spectacle was the protesters, beating drums, singing and chanting. This is the reality of Trump's honeymoon-free presidency. Thousands gather at Denver's City Center Park for a rally in support of the Muslim community and to protest President Donald Trump's executive order to temporarily ban some refugees from seven mostly Muslim countries, in Denver, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017. Thousands gather at Denver's City Center Park for a rally in support of the Muslim community and to protest President Donald Trump's executive order to temporarily ban some refugees from seven mostly Muslim countries, in Denver, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017. Having sought to create unprecedented disruption in Washington, his critics will now seek to bring unprecedented disruption to his life as president - including demonstrations that follow him when he travels and protests that will dog his businesses even when he doesn't. Already this week, Trump - the most unpopular new president in modern times - canceled a trip to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee, where local groups had planned to protest his appearance; the White House said the protests were not the reason for the cancellation. And, around the business empire that Trump still owns, his critics treat each location as an avatar for the president. There have been small gestures of pique: lipstick graffiti on the sign at Trump's golf course in Los Angeles; and a plan for a mass mooning of his hotel in Chicago. There have also been more organized efforts to take time and money away from family businesses - a boycott of stores selling Ivanka Trump's clothes and a campaign to flood Trump businesses with calls demanding that the president divest from his holdings. For Trump's opponents, these demonstrations are a way to change his behavior by denting the president's own self-image as a popular man with a successful business. The risk, for them, is that protests meant to shame Trump will consume energy that could be used to beat him by winning elections and swaying votes in Congress. Millions of women gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecdented international rebuke of a new president that packed... Millions of women gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecdented international rebuke of a new president that packed... A protest "gets under his skin," said Michael Skolnik, a filmmaker and prominent liberal organizer in New York who supports this sort of demonstration. He said he hoped that, somehow, getting under the president's skin might turn out to be a good long-term political strategy. "What if Trump can't come out of bed for four days? That could happen," Skolnik said. In the later days of his presidency, George W. Bush faced protests outside his Texas ranch from people opposed to the Iraq War. During President Barack Obama's travels, he sometimes faced demonstrations from liberals pushing him to do more on immigration or the environment. But neither one faced organized protest movements at the start of their presidency, condemning the president across multiple policy areas. Trump does. It began the day after his inauguration, when more than 1 million people marched in Women's Marches in Washington, across the country and around the globe. It continued the next weekend, when thousands of people gathered at airports to protest Trump's executive order on immigration, which barred refugees and all visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. It continued this past week as the administration was consumed by the chaos that the entry ban set off. In New York City, for instance, hundreds of bodega markets owned by Yemeni Americans closed Thursday to protest the same ban. "You know how Yellowstone National Park is built on one of the world's biggest volcanoes?" said Ben Wikler, the Washington director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group. "It feels like that just exploded in terms of grass-roots energy." Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... Trump has dismissed these protests - operating on the theory that he doesn't need these protesters to like him and that their anger might help him by pushing others closer to him. On Twitter, for instance, the president cast the Women's March as a massive outpouring of sour grapes. "Was under the impression that we just had an election!" Trump wrote on Twitter. "Why didn't these people vote?" On Friday - after a pair of violent protests on college campuses where conservative provocateurs were invited to talk - Trump seemed to lump these small groups of unruly protesters in with the rest of his critics from the other events. "Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," he said, although there is no evidence that any significant number of demonstrators are being paid. Across the country, other groups have directed their unhappiness toward Trump at his business empire, which he still effectively owns, although Trump says he has shifted the management to his executives and adult sons. "I am scoping it out right now," said a woman snapping photos of the sign outside Trump's golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., near Los Angeles. She gave her name only as "Diane" and said she was scouting the site for a protest. Protesters opposed to President Donald Trump's Immigration policy gather outside the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village bar where the gay rights movement was born, Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017.

"People are p----- and feel they can't do anything, but we want to hit him where it hurts," she said. "I don't think he wants people near his businesses. We want to hit him where it hurts most - his money." On an earlier day, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department took a vandalism report - somebody crossed out "Trump" on the sign with lipstick and wrote a Spanish swear word there. Others were more organized about their efforts. One group, Grab Your Wallet, was started in October after The Washington Post obtained a 2005 video of a taping of "Access Hollywood" in which Trump bragged about groping women. Shannon Coulter, who helps lead the group, said she had a visceral reaction after that when she encountered Ivanka Trump-branded items while shopping. Ivanka Trump had continued to campaign for her father after the tape's release. "I kind of had [Trump's] words ringing in my ears," she said. She helped launch a boycott campaign, which has grown to include more than 60 companies - including the Trump Organization's own hotels and golf courses, business that carry Ivanka Trump merchandise and businesses whose leaders supported Trump during the election. Coulter said her Facebook group has thousands of people connected to it. What they want, she said, is to "shop the stores we love with a clear conscience and without any bad memories." Nordstrom will stop selling Ivanka Trump's name-branded line of clothing and shoes, a company spokesperson said Thursday. The change followed a weeks-long boycott campaign, organized by an anti-Trump activist group called "Grab Your Wallet." The group demanded the department-store giant cease doing... Nordstrom will stop selling Ivanka Trump's name-branded line of clothing and shoes, a company spokesperson said Thursday. The change followed a weeks-long boycott campaign, organized by an anti-Trump activist group called "Grab Your Wallet." The group demanded the department-store giant cease doing... Now, three businesses that her group targeted for boycotts have severed or loosened their connections to the Trumps. Nordstrom said it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise, Nieman Marcus stopped selling her jewelry on its website and the chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company, pulled out of Trump's business advisory council. Another campaign offers Trump's critics a more direct - but possibly less productive - way to respond to Trump. It lets them call one of his companies at random and complain to whomever answers the phone. "Until he divests, these [businesses] are embassies of the White House," said Scott Goodstein, the co-founder of Creative Majority PAC. He also runs Revolution Messaging, the Washington firm that set up the system. The system connects callers to one of 30 Trump business phone numbers. It could be a hotel front desk. It could be a restaurant. Goodstein said they encourage callers to "have fun with it." For instance, if a restaurant employee offers to help make a reservation, one might say: "I have a reservation - that Donald Trump is not taking this job seriously." Since this effort started in December, the PAC says it has facilitated 33,000 phone calls and been blocked by 51 Trump Organization phone numbers. He said it's having the desired effect by squeezing Trump's business in a way that would squeeze the man himself. "It's definitely having an effect on Trump's businesses," Goodstein said. "And I'm sure that President Trump will know that this act of dissension is taking place." But Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, said in a telephone interview that the phone calls have not interfered with the business. And even if they did, he said, Trump would not know about it because he has resigned from his management roles. "There's a complete separation," Garten said. "He may read [about] it in the newspaper, that I don't know." Fahrenthold reported from Washington.

Lawyers aren’t usually this popular, but these weren’t your usual lawyers. Outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn last weekend, a crowd of hundreds throbbed with jittery energy, chanting like soccer fans as they awaited the end of a court hearing inside, clearly favoring one side: “A-C-L-U, we are here, we stand with you!” When the attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union emerged, the crowd roared, hailing them as heroes. As the nonprofit has done so many times in its 97-year history, the ACLU had taken on the government and won. “It was unbelievable,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt recalled, calling it the biggest crowd he’d seen in two decades of civil rights law. “It was just one of those classic civil rights moments.” On a day when thousands of Americans had gathered to protest at airports around the country, the ACLU was among the legal organizations that sued the federal government over President Trump’s executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Stunned visa and green card holders were being detained on arrival, and Gelernt had just persuaded a judge to temporarily block the government from sending them back. “What we’ve shown today is that the courts can work. They’re a bulwark in our democracy,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, addressing the crowd. Trump has moved with substantial speed to issue orders and make appointments that many liberals fear will infringe on the rights of immigrants, Muslims and other minorities. With Congress also under GOP control, many liberals are turning to outside organizations in an attempt to block the new administration’s progress. Subscriptions to mainstream news publications and nonprofit investigative news outlets such as ProPublica and the Marshall Project have soared since the election; so have donations to left-leaning nonprofits like the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood. Few, if any, have rallied greater support than the ACLU, which, for the moment, has captured activists’ imagination in a way that the Democratic Party has not. The ACLU’s membership has doubled to more than 1 million people in the months since Trump’s election, when the organization issued a defiant vow on its website and over social media: “We’ll see you in court.” The ACLU is promising, as it often does, to take a place on the front lines of a liberal resistance, defending causes including voting rights, reproductive rights, LGBT rights, freedom of the press and the rights of Muslims and immigrants. Conservatives have long been critical of the organization, with their ire often focused on the group’s contention that the 2nd Amendment’s guarantee of a “well-regulated militia” refers to a collective right, not an individual right, to gun ownership. They have also opposed the group’s campaigns against religious expression within public institutions and restrictions on abortion and same-sex marriage. After employees at Twitter recently announced they would donate $1.59 million to the ACLU, right-wing Breitbart News lost no time in describing the group as “an ideologically left-wing organization with strong ties to the Democratic Party.” What has been remarkable about the events of the last two weeks has been the sudden groundswell of public support across a broad spectrum, backed by cash. Twitter wasn’t the only tech enterprise to pony up support. Lyft, the ride-sharing company, pledged $1 million over four years, as its rival, Uber, was targeted with a consumer boycott for sending drivers to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport during a taxi-driver strike launched in protest of the Trump administration’s travel ban. GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., has devoted much of its home page to an invitation to donate to the ACLU. Yet much smaller donors have been a key part of the fundraising effort. During last weekend’s protests, the organization gathered at least $31 million in donations, many of them from baristas, actors, musicians, tech figures and from owners of restaurants, bookstores, bakeries and coffee shops. In Milwaukee, attorneys Amy Rogan-Mehta and Rebeca Lopez were barraged by messages from friends wondering how to get more politically involved. They decided to hold a fundraiser for the ACLU, citing its long history and its willingness to represent a wide range of causes. A local soccer bar, whose bartender is an immigrant, quickly volunteered its space. After more than 100 people quickly RSVP’d to come, the pair had to find a second venue for an overflow crowd, and about 150 people ultimately attended. “Folks are concerned about rights right now, and ACLU has done a good job of leveraging social media lately,” Rogan-Mehta said. After last weekend’s protests, Liza Conrad, 28, a tech worker in New York, worked with a friend to create a website called  Next Protest that lists all the upcoming protests in New York. The pair then went a step further and added link to donate to the ACLU. “They have a proven track record,” Conrad explained. “They showed up ready to win, because this is what they’ve been doing for a long time, and they’re really good at it.” The ACLU was founded in 1920 in the wake of the so-called Palmer Raids, when the federal government, fearing the rise of communism, began detaining and deporting alleged radical leftists. “This, in some ways for us, is like business as usual,” said ACLU president and Brooklyn Law School professor Susan Herman, who likened the organization’s fight against Trump’s travel ban to its work against the Palmer Raids. One of the ACLU’s first handbills from the 1920s laid out the organization’s strategy early: "Rights can be maintained only by insisting upon them  — by organization, protest, demonstrations, test cases in the courts, and publicity." In the decades to come, the ACLU would launch affiliates in every state, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and file thousands of civil rights lawsuits. It has played a role in some of the nation’s most famous court battles, including the 1925 Scopes trial over the teaching of evolution and the fight against the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Protesters and helmeted police officers prepare for a march through Skokie by American Nazis in April 1977. Protesters and helmeted police officers prepare for a march through Skokie by American Nazis in April 1977. While officially nonpartisan, the ACLU has been criticized since its birth for heavily favoring liberal and leftist causes, though the group has also taken up highly unpopular 1st Amendment cases defending the rights of Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, including the famed case of the National Socialist Party of America's march through heavily-Jewish Skokie. But the group is clearly a life raft for the left at times when conservatives are in power; the group’s membership has typically surged under Republican presidents. The ACLU led a drive for the impeachment of President Nixon during the Watergate controversy, proclaiming in a newspaper ad, “If he is allowed to continue, then destruction of the Bill of Rights could follow.” The group’s membership also doubled to more than 500,000 under George W. Bush’s presidency as the administration expanded its national security powers after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Recent campaign finance data show that individual ACLU staff members overwhelmingly donate to Democratic candidates, though the organization as a whole does not endorse candidates or Supreme Court appointments. “We don’t oppose presidents, we oppose presidents’ actions,” said Romero, the first Latino and openly gay man to serve as the group’s executive director, noting that the organization had researched and published a document on the campaign positions of both Trump and Hillary Clinton. In those missives, the group voiced concern over Trump’s expressions of support for torture, mass deportations and a sweeping ban on Muslim immigration. “We knew if this man got elected, he would be a one-man constitutional crisis,” said Romero. (The group had also expressed concerns about Clinton’s previous support for mass surveillance and President Obama’s drone strike program.) When Trump won on Nov. 8, Romero scheduled a conference call for the following Monday. “It was just the most refreshing thing that happened all week, because he had a clear, calm, confident vision for how the ACLU was going to go about responding to Trump,” said Samuel Walker, a retired professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a former ACLU board member. Romero says his strategy is to block any legal overreaches by the new administration in court and to rally mass public support. “If you can ball up the machinery of the Trump administration and rob them of momentum in the way we did last weekend, we make it harder for them to go to the next thing on their to-do list,” Romero said in an interview. Court cases will also “frame the public debate and … galvanize the public response” so the public can “demand accountability from Congress, to make sure they serve a proper oversight role,” said Romero. “It’s the pincer action between legal advocacy and citizen action that is the powerful way to send a message that the government is on the wrong track.” After the ACLU’s victory Saturday, a new message appeared on its website: a photo of Trump and a summons for more donations. “He discriminated,” the message says. “We sued.” Pearce reported from Los Angeles and Demick from New York. matt.pearce@latimes.com @mattdpearce

One week into office, President Donald Trump was trying to clean up his first international incident. The president shifted a jam-packed schedule Friday to make room for an hourlong phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who had abruptly snubbed the new president by canceling a visit. Trump's team had appeared to respond by threatening a hefty border tax on Mexican imports. By the end of the conversation, Trump had tasked his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner — a real estate executive with no national security experience — with managing the ongoing dispute, according to an administration official with knowledge of the call. The episode, an uneven diplomatic debut, revealed the earliest signs of how the new president plans to manage world affairs. In a matter of days, he both alarmed and reassured international partners. He picked fights, then quickly backed away from them. He talked tough, and toned it down. And at each step, Trump relied on the small clutch of advisers that guided his norm-breaking campaign, a group with scant foreign policy experience but the trust of the president. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke for an hour by phone Friday amid rising tensions over the U.S. leader's plans for a southern border wall, administration officials said.

Trump and Pena Nieto had been expected to meet in Washington next week, but the Mexican... Much of the foreign policy decision-making has rested with Kushner and Steve Bannon, the conservative media executive turned White House adviser, according to administration officials and diplomats. Rex Tillerson, his nominee for secretary of state, is still awaiting confirmation. Officials at the National Security Council, an agency Trump has described as bloated, are still seeking marching orders from the new administration. Some of Trump's early diplomatic moves have followed standard protocols. He scheduled early phone calls with friendly allies, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who both plan to meet Trump at the White House next month. Additional calls were planned Saturday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, key European partners. But Trump also moved swiftly to announce a new era. He declared an end to efforts to pursue multi-nation trade deals and used his first executive action to withdraw the U.S. from a sweeping Pacific Rim pact. He also effectively closed off the United States to refugees, at least temporarily, and risked angering the Arab world by halting visas for people from seven majority Muslim nations for at least three months. On his first full day as president, he told members of the intelligence community gathered at CIA headquarters that the U.S. should have taken Iraq's oil for "economic reasons," given America's efforts in the country, adding, "But, OK, maybe you'll have another chance." Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned Tuesday meeting with President Donald J. Trump on Thursday, signaling a remarkable souring of relations between Washington and one of its most important international partners just days into the new administration.

Trump on Thursday, signaling a remarkable souring of relations between Washington and one of its most important international partners just days into the new administration. The rift capped days of... Some officials at the National Security Council raised concerns over several elements of the refugee measure, as well as other early actions the president took on border security. But administration officials say Trump's inner circle has addressed few of their concerns. Administration officials and diplomats insisted on anonymity to disclose private dealings with the White House. Kushner and Bannon have been heavily involved in the Trump administration's early dealings with some European partners, leading during both phone calls and in-person meetings with diplomats and government officials. In a discussion with British officials, Kushner is said to have angrily denounced the United Kingdom's decision to support a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the expansion of Israeli settlements. The U.S. abstained from the vote before President Barack Obama left office, brushing aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto. Asked about Kushner's involvement on foreign policy, a White House official said he was "particularly well-suited for sensitive negotiations and relationship building."

It was Trump's first... President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared chummy as they faced a curious world together for the first time Friday, pledging allegiance to the special relationship between their countries while trying to mask stark differences on some major issues. It was Trump's first... In contrast with the Trump team's strong views on Israel, European partners have been left largely in the dark about Trump's approach to Russia. Some are on edge over a phone call with Putin on Saturday and fear he may strike a deal that leads to the removal of U.S. sanctions on Russia. The call was said to be arranged by national security adviser Mike Flynn, who has kept a low profile in recent days amid scrutiny over his ties to Russian officials. Trump did little to ease anxieties Friday when he pointedly refused to say whether he planned to keep in place economic sanctions on Russia as punishment for its provocations in Ukraine. "We'll see what happens," Trump said during a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. The prime minister was the first world leader to meet Trump following last week's inauguration, underscoring May's eagerness to get a reading on a man who is a mystery to many world leaders. Trump was measured during their brief joint press conference, but he also showed flashes of charm, joking with May about a British reporter's pointed question about his position on torture and complimenting her for being a "people person." During his presidential campaign, no single promise electrified Donald Trump’s supporters more than the pledge to build a “big, beautiful wall” all along the border with Mexico.

During his presidential campaign, no single promise electrified Donald Trump’s supporters more than the pledge to build a “big, beautiful wall” all along the border with Mexico. Wednesday, President Trump turned that promise into an executive order, one of two he signed. His directive leaves many... A visit from Pena Nieto to Washington had been expected to follow May's. But after Trump needled the Mexican president on Twitter, saying it would be better for him not to come if he couldn't commit to paying for Trump's proposed wall along the U.S. southern border, Pena Nieto told the White House he wouldn't be coming. The White House quickly threatened to slap a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for the wall, though officials quickly tried to walk the proposal back, saying it was just one option being considered. Kushner, who already wields enormous power in the White House, is expected to work through the dispute with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray. The two men, who know each other from the financial circles, also worked together to arrange Trump's surprise visit to Mexico during the presidential campaign. The readouts released by the two countries after Friday's call pointed to the work to be done. A statement from Mexico said the presidents agreed "to no longer speak publicly" about their dispute over payment for the border wall. The White House statement made no such promise. Associated Press

President Donald Trump joined his chief strategist Friday in characterizing the media as "the opposition party," expressing an unusually high level of antagonism toward the press just a week into his administration. Trump, echoing comments made by strategist Steve Bannon earlier this week, told CBN News that a "big portion of the media" is guilty of "dishonesty, total deceit and deception. It makes them certainly partially the opposition party." Trump continued that the media is "much more capable than the opposition party. The opposition party is losing badly. Now the media is on the opposition party's side." Speaking to the New York Times on Wednesday, Bannon said, “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country." But Trump's antagonism toward the media just a week after he took the oath of office is far from the norm, historians said Friday, citing the many past presidents who made at least the appearance of reaching out to the press. "To come right out of the blocks in this extremely adversarial stance is kind of unprecedented," said David Greenberg, a professor of history at Rutgers University who has written about the Nixon presidency. "Even when Nixon began he promised an open administration." Trump's statement extends the tenor he struck with the media even before he took office, said Mark Updegrove, the director of the LBJ Presidential Library who is also a presidential historian. A week in, it's clear that there will no honeymoon period for this president with the media, he said. "Trump made no secret of how he felt about the press during the campaign and during the transition. That was unusual. So there were shots that were fired well before the inauguration and it portended the relationship," Updegrove said. Greenberg, a former reporter and editor, said the media has played a consciously adversarial role with the presidency since the 1960s or 1970s, seeing it as their job to hold power to account and investigate administrations. Criticism of the media can resonate with a president's supporters. But Trump's criticism is outsized, he said. "Most presidents find themselves lashing out, or at least being privately upset at how they're treated. I think its human nature. Trump is just an extreme case," he said. Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the "alt-right" movement, which white nationalists have embraced. Bannon, who was the executive chairman of Breitbart News before joining the Trump campaign in August, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor for Trump; that will give Bannon authority over the strategic direction of the White House. Bannon will assume a similar role to that of Karl Rove during George W. Bush's administration and recently by longtime strategist John Podesta under President Barack Obama. He and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will become White House chief of staff, will be among Trump's top advisers. The announcement has produced intense hand-wringing in Washington, D.C., and sharp denunciations from political observers and strategists critical of Breitbart News' close association with the alt-right, a fringe conservative movement saturated with racially insensitive rhetoric and elements of outright white nationalism. Donald Trump made his first significant moves as the nation’s president-elect on Sunday, naming two campaign insiders with sharply contrasting approaches as his top White House aides while also signaling that he will seek to promptly deport up to 3 million immigrants with "criminal records’’ who... Donald Trump made his first significant moves as the nation’s president-elect on Sunday, naming two campaign insiders with sharply contrasting approaches as his top White House aides while also signaling that he will seek to promptly deport up to 3 million immigrants with "criminal records’’ who... The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, has accused Breitbart of explicitly embracing ethno-nationalism. After Bannon's elevation was announced, the law center tweeted several controversial stories written by Breitbart under Bannon's control, including a piece published two weeks after the mass killing at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, last year: "Hoist it high and proud: the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage." "Stephen Bannon was the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill," the law center wrote via Twitter in its first statements on Bannon's elevation. "Trump should rescind this hire. In his victory speech, Trump said he intended to be president for 'all Americans.' Bannon should go." Trump's critics, across the political spectrum, immediately blasted the move on social media. Bannon's personal history also has been mired in controversy. Shortly after he joined the Trump campaign, court documents revealed that his ex-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, had accused Bannon of domestic violence and anti-Semitic language in 2007. (The documents were obtained and first reported by the New York Daily News.)

"He said that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats' and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews." Bannon has denied the accusations. Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who worked closely with Bannon, called him a "legitimately sinister figure" in an article he published on the Daily Wire after Bannon joined the Trump campaign. "Many former employees of Breitbart News are afraid of Steve Bannon. He is a vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies," Shapiro wrote. Some of the Trump campaign's most controversial moves in the final months of the campaign were attributed to Bannon, who is known for his combative and unfiltered style. When Trump, before the second presidential debate, invited several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to hold a news conference, Bannon stood in the back of the room smiling broadly. "I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to work with Reince in driving the agenda of the Trump Administration," Bannon said in a statement released by the campaign Sunday. "We had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda." Bannon's appointment brings into focus many of the uncomfortable racial tensions surrounding Trump's campaign. Throughout the campaign, Trump's critics regularly accused him of using anti-immigrant language and racial grievances to motivate his supporters, charges that he denied and dismissed. He expressed surprise when asked about racial slurs that were being used against African Americans and other minority groups since his election during an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday. "I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear that, I mean, I hate to hear that," Trump said in the interview, which was taped Friday. "I would say don't do it, that's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together. "I am so saddened to hear that. And I say stop it, if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it," Trump added.

Donald Trump's appointment of conservative media guru Steven K. Bannon as a top White House aide has Republicans in Congress scrambling to avoid guilt by association without casting aspersions on the president-elect before he takes office. "The president-elect has to be able to select his best team," House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Monday to reporters asking him whether House Republicans were comfortable with Trump choosing Bannon. The former head of Breitbart news, Bannon has published stories taking aim at Muslims, Jews, women and African Americans, as well as making his own allegedly anti-Semitic statements. But Republicans seem unwilling to judge Bannon on that track record - or even accept that he bears responsibility for the more incendiary headlines from the news organization he led. "Did he write it? Give me something that he wrote," Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said when asked about whether Bannon's appointment. "I hear a lot of innuendo of this, but I haven't seen it." McCarthy also suggested that reported information about Bannon, including the headlines on his website, could be wrong. "I've seen things said about me that I know are not true, but because they're on the internet, 'they must be true,' " McCarthy said. President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the "alt-right" movement, which white nationalists have embraced. President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the "alt-right" movement, which white nationalists have embraced. The furthest that McCarthy would go in criticizing Bannon is to say that if he had indeed published a Breitbart headline calling former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a "human shield" for the gun-control movement, "nowhere would I ever agree with those words, nowhere would I ever stand behind those words." Other Republican members said they didn't expect Breitbart news headlines that were approved under Bannon to have any bearing on how he would advise Trump in the White House. "Of course I'd have serious problems with anti-Semitic statements coming out of the White House, but I don't expect that," said Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. Bannon's appointment, Cramer added, to him "symbolizes tremendous loyalty" and that Trump understands a system of "checks and balances is appropriate even within his own shop."

Vouching for the successor he never imagined having, President Barack Obama on Monday sought to reassure an anxious nation and world that Donald Trump would maintain America's alliances and its status as the "indispensable nation." He credited the president-elect for tapping into American voters'... Many Republicans spoke highly of Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman whom Trump newly named his chief of staff. McCarthy said Priebus had assured him that the Bannon being portrayed in the press was "not the Steve Bannon I know." "But Donald Trump has the ability to select who he thinks could move forward," McCarthy concluded. Few GOP members of Congress appeared to have a relationship with Bannon. McCarthy said he and Bannon had one short phone conversation Sunday night to get acquainted. McCarthy said he would tell minorities who fear the message of Bannon's appointment: "Don't prejudge the new president. Give him an opportunity to govern." "If there's something he proposes that you disagree with, fight it," McCarthy said. "But why do you prejudge him?"

Steve Bannon's elevation from chairman of Breitbart News to chief executive of the Donald Trump campaign has been seen as a pivot away from the "establishment," a way for Trump to be around people who he likes and trusts for the last stretch for the presidential race. It's also been an occasion for people to bone up on Bannon, who has grown Breitbart and co-founded an associated think tank (the Government Accountability Institute) without becoming a household name. But to anyone covering conservative politics, Breitbart has been a force. 1. It's a real news site; it just covers a different world Whatever else it can be accused of, Breitbart is a warehouse of original news. It sends reporters after stories; it produces a daily Sirius XM show, loaded with interviews. It's expanded to California, Texas and the United Kingdom, where it has resoundingly backed the campaign to exit the European Union. In Washington, or on the campaign trail, it's common to hear a Breitbart reporter asking questions in a scrum - often on a topic that's not making headlines elsewhere. But the common conceit of Breitbart articles is that the rest of the media is blowing the story, and that the site's exclusive sourcing can correct that. At times, that's led to stories that flew wide of the mark. In January 2013, Breitbart's Matthew Boyle reported that enough Republican members of the House had pledged to oppose John Boehner that he could not be renominated as speaker of the House. In the end, Boehner got the votes. This year, Breitbart had a reporter on the ground in House Speaker Paul Ryan's district, but its coverage reflected a poll - conducted for Breitbart - that found challenger Paul Nehlen closing in fast. In the end, Nehlen was defeated by a landslide, but he remains a popular subject of Breitbart coverage. 2. It's got white nationalists reading In January, after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ran an odd and quasi-viral ad that showed lawyers and journalists crossing the border to take American jobs, Bannon interviewed the academic researcher Jason Richwine for an episode of the site's newscast. "He's got a huge fanbase at Breitbart," said Bannon. "One of the smartest brains out there in demographics, demography, this whole issue of immigration and what it means to to this country." Donald Trump, following weeks of agitation over his advisers' attempts to temper his style, moved Wednesday to overhaul his struggling campaign by rebuffing those efforts and personally elevating two longtime associates who have encouraged his combative populism.Trump's decision sent a powerful... Donald Trump, following weeks of agitation over his advisers' attempts to temper his style, moved Wednesday to overhaul his struggling campaign by rebuffing those efforts and personally elevating two longtime associates who have encouraged his combative populism.Trump's decision sent a powerful... Richwine had famously been pushed out of the Heritage Foundation after he published a paper about the possible economic cost of the 2013 immigration bill, and The Washington Post discovered his thesis about the IQs of immigrant groups. At the time, and in retrospect, he was viewed by some on the right as a victim of political correctness. Breitbart, like the Drudge Report - a site that links frequently - has covered immigration as an economic and cultural challenge to America, profiling crimes by undocumented immigrants. As Betsy Woodruff reports in the Daily Beast, editors of more established nationalist sites have seen Bannon-era Breitbart coming after their audiences. "He's more of a nationalist than a conservative," said Ben Shapiro, a former editor-at-large who quit the site in March. "He's a Pat Buchanan type. He shifted in that direction over the last few years; whether that's because of Trump, or it's what he believes, I can't say." 3. There's a battle over what its founder believed Andrew Breitbart died suddenly on March 1, 2012, at 42 years of age. As Bannon and other successors took over the news site he created, political opponents mourned Breitbart as a decent man who'd always dealt honestly with them; conservatives mourned him as a far-sighted media genius. The latest shake-up in Donald Trump's campaign is rightly described as a move to "let Trump be Trump." In reality, the sudden changes highlight the fact that a politician whose instincts appeared so sure during the Republican primaries has lost his way as a general election candidate. It remains... The latest shake-up in Donald Trump's campaign is rightly described as a move to "let Trump be Trump." In reality, the sudden changes highlight the fact that a politician whose instincts appeared so sure during the Republican primaries has lost his way as a general election candidate. It remains... "When I read his book, I realized - wow, he really understood it," said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, at a Washington memorial service for Breitbart. "Marcuse, the Frankfurt School, all of that." As the Breitbart network grew more bullish on Donald Trump, some of Andrew Breitbart's conservative admirers said that he never would have let it come to this. "How much better off would conservatives be right now if Andrew Breitbart and Justice Scalia were still alive?" asked the Weekly Standard's Mark Hemingway in a tweet. Their Rosetta stone is an April 22, 2011, appearance on Fox News, where Juan Williams asked Breitbart to analyze the politics of Trump, already considering a bid for president. "Is Donald Trump a conservative?" Williams asked. "Of course he is not a conservative," Breitbart replied. "He was for Nancy Pelosi before he was against Nancy Pelosi. But this is a message to those candidates who are languishing at 2 percent and 3 percent within the Republican Party who are brand names in Washington, but the rest of the country don't know ... celebrity is everything in this country. And if these guys don't learn how to play the media the way that Barack Obama played the media last election cycle and the way that Donald Trump is playing the election cycle, we're going to probably get a celebrity candidate." Since then, the conservatives who can't believe what "Trumpbart" has become have insisted that the founder would have fought against it. In June, when Breitbart's editor Joel Pollak told one of those critics to back off, National Review's Jonah Goldberg reignited the debate. 4. It was pro-Palin before it was pro-Trump In 2011, Bannon released a two-hour documentary about Sarah Palin called "The Undefeated," attempting to reshape the way voters and the media viewed the former candidate for vice president. "The reason she draws this kind of fire is that she is an existential threat to the establishment," Bannon told Fox News's Sean Hannity during the film's promotional tour. "The vested interests in our country are scared to death of her." Breitbart News did not get going until after Palin had already resigned as governor of Alaska. But her battle with the "lamestream media" was a through-line of conservative media coverage, and Bannon and the site he came to lead both adopted Palin and her enemies. In 2014, after Buzzfeed's McKay Coppins ran a wry and deeply reported story about a weekend with Trump's "fake presidential campaign," Palin was among the people approached to attack the reporter, branding him an enemy of fair coverage. Palin's importance to conservative media was not that of a potential president, but of a martyr. In 2009 and 2010, it was common for conservatives to argue that the media had dogpiled Palin while allowing Obama to skate to the presidency. Radio host and filmmaker John Ziegler shot a short film on the subject; authors Matt Lewis and Matt Continetti published, respectively, a book of Palin quotes and a tract about her "persecution." That sympathetic view has faded since 2011, but it remained elemental to Breitbart, notably in a 2013 series called "the vetting," which claimed to reveal the Obama news - video of him at a protest, an early media clipping that called him "Kenyan" - the media had not bothered to find. 5. It's sometimes pro-gay (and pro-Gamergate) The biggest individual star at Breitbart may be Milo Yiannopoulos, a British journalist and pundit who became the site's "technology editor" in 2015. Telegenic, quotable and proudly gay, Yiannopoulos rose to prominence in America with coverage of the "Gamergate" saga, which began as a dispute between a jilted-feeling game designer and his ex and mushroomed into a battle against "social justice warriors." Yiannopoulos and some researchers covered and advanced the story, reporting, for example, on the fact that one anti-Gamergate critic had transitioned from male to female. When accused of farming out the hard work to interns, Yiannopoulos scoffed that "business is booming," and his merchandising and media presence could not be maintained by one man. "I've launched the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant to help young white men reach college, and we have a steady stream of contributions," he joked. That fame was leveraged into a unique role for Yiannopoulos - a gay conservative, derisive of feminists and transgender activists, who argued that Trump (often called "Daddy" or "God-Emperor Daddy") was doing more for gay rights than any activist, by taking seriously the threat of radical Islam. In turn, and strikingly, Trump has consistently mentioned the threat that groups like ISIS pose to gays. The battle between Breitbart's narrative-smashers and the forces of political correctness has given Breitbart a brio not often seen in conservative media. Last month, after Yiannopoulos trolled "Ghostbusters" star Leslie Jones (like many critics, he had panned the movie), he was banned from Twitter. That ban happened to coincide with the Republican National Convention, where media outlets were packed booth-to-booth in two large work spaces. Breitbart cameras followed Yiannopoulos and Boyle as they crashed Twitter's booth, asking staffers if they supported "free speech" or censorship. All day Wednesday, while Bannon held off interview requests, Breitbart published flattering stories about Trump. A compilation of tweets from people often quoted in Breitbart pushed the theme that "grass-roots pundits" were on board with the move. A feature story by James Pinkerton argued that the Trump campaign was back on track, and that "if Trump keeps up his momentum for the next three months, then, as did Reagan nearly four decades ago, he'll win in a landslide."

Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party's quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. The recording reveals a GOP that appears to be filled with doubts about how to make good on a long-standing promise to get rid of Obamacare without explicit guidance from President Donald Trump or his administration. The thorny issues lawmakers grapple with on the tape - including who may end up either losing coverage or paying more under a revamped system - highlight the financial and political challenges that flow from upending the current law. Senators and House members expressed a range of concerns about the task ahead: how to prepare a replacement plan that can be ready to launch at the time of repeal; how to avoid deep damage to the health insurance market; how to keep premiums affordable for middle-class families; even how to avoid the political consequences of defunding Planned Parenthood, the women's health-care organization, as many Republicans hope to do with the repeal of the ACA. "We'd better be sure that we're prepared to live with the market we've created" with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. "That's going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we'll be judged in the election less than two years away." Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Sen.

Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017, prior to the start of Price's confirmation hearing before the committee. Recordings of closed sessions at the Republican policy retreat in Philadelphia this week were sent late Thursday to The Post and several other news outlets from an anonymous email address. The remarks of all lawmakers quoted in this story were confirmed by their offices or by the lawmakers themselves. "Our goal, in my opinion, should be not a quick fix. We can do it rapidly - but not a quick fix," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. "We want a long-term solution that lowers costs." Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, warned his colleagues that the estimated budget savings from repealing Obamacare - which Republicans say could approach a half-trillion dollars - would be needed to fund the costs of setting up a replacement. "This is going to be what we'll need to be able to move to that transition," he said. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Tex., worried that one idea floated by Republicans - a refundable tax credit - would not work for middle-class families that cannot afford to prepay their premiums and wait for a tax refund. Republicans have also discussed the idea of generating revenue for their plan by taking aim at deductions that allow most Americans to get health insurance through their employers without paying extra taxes on it. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who has drafted his own bill to reform the Affordable Care Act, said in response, "It sounds like we are going to be raising taxes on the middle class in order to pay for these new credits." At least 18 million people would lose health insurance in the first year if Republicans re-create previous plans to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The number of people without insurance would grow to about... At least 18 million people would lose health insurance in the first year if Republicans re-create previous plans to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The number of people without insurance would grow to about... Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Tex., who chairs a key tax-writing subcommittee, countered, "I don't see it that way," adding that there is "a tax break on employer-sponsored health care and nowhere else" equal to $3.6 billion over 10 years. "Could you unlock just a small portion at the top to be able to give that freedom [to self-employed Americans]? That is the question," Brady said. Rep. John Faso, R-N.Y., a freshman congressman from the Hudson Valley, warned strongly against using the repeal of the ACA to also defund Planned Parenthood. "We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill," he said. "If you want to do it somewhere else, I have no problem, but I think we are creating a political minefield for ourselves - House and Senate." The concerns of rank-and-file lawmakers appeared to be at odds with key congressional leaders and Andrew Bremberg, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, who have laid out plans to repeal the ACA using a fast-track legislative process and executive actions from the administration. However, these leaders acknowledged in Thursday's meeting, as they have before, that Obamacare cannot be fully undone - or replaced - without Democratic cooperation. That and other aspects of the unfinished GOP plan prompted several wary lawmakers to urge their leaders to move more deliberately - even as the Trump administration appears to be moving ahead with repeal. Thursday, the White House ordered federal health officials to immediately halt all advertising and other outreach activities for the critical final days in which Americans can sign up for 2017 health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The administration partly retracted that directive on Friday, allowing the Health and Human Services Department to continue to contact people eligible for ACA coverage by email, text and automated phone calls and reviving use of a HealthCare.gov Twitter account.The new directive also airing of some ads if the government would otherwise lose the money. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., dismissed the concerns aired in the meeting during an interview at a Politico event Friday. "We have a responsibility to work for the people that put us in office," he said. "That's the oath we take: to defend the Constitution, to fight for the people we represent, and this is a fiasco that needs to be fixed." Of particular concern to some Republican lawmakers was a plan to use the budget reconciliation process - which requires only a simple majority vote - to repeal the existing law, while still needing a filibuster-proof vote of 60 in the Senate to enact a replacement. "The fact is, we cannot repeal Obamacare through reconciliation," McClintock said. "We need to understand exactly: What does that reconciliation market look like? And I haven't heard the answer yet." Several important policy areas appeared unsettled. While the chairmen of key committees sketched out various proposals, they did not have a clear plan for how to keep markets viable while requiring insurers to cover everyone who seeks insurance. At one point Cassidy, a physician who co-founded a community health clinic in Baton Rouge to serve the uninsured, asked the panelists a "simple question": Will states have the ability to maintain the expanded Medicaid rolls provided for under the ACA, which now provide coverage for more than 10 million Americans, and can other states do similar expansions? "These are decisions we haven't made yet," said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., worried that the plans under GOP consideration could eviscerate coverage for the roughly 20 million Americans now covered through state and federal marketplaces and the law's Medicaid expansion: "We're telling those people that we're not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them." Republicans are also still wrestling with whether Obamacare's taxes can be immediately repealed, a priority for many conservatives, or whether that revenue will be needed to fund a transition period. And there seems to be little consensus on whether to pursue a major overhaul of Medicaid - converting it from an open-ended entitlement that costs federal and state governments $500 billion a year to a fixed block grant. Trump and his top aides, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, have publicly endorsed that idea. But doing so would mean that some low-income Americans would not be automatically covered by a program that currently covers 70 million Americans. Many of the concerns aired Thursday were more political than policy-oriented. Faso's remarks about Planned Parenthood generated tepid applause. Ryan said this month that he expects the House to pursue the organization's defunding in the reconciliation bill. Those expressing qualms included some of the top congressional leaders who are in line to draft the health-care legislation. Alexander, for one, is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Ryan and other leaders have said they intend to pursue a piecemeal approach, following the reconciliation bill with smaller ones that address discrete aspects of reform. Bremberg, chairman of Trump's domestic policy council, offered little detail in the session about particular executive actions the Trump administration intends to take or what legislative proposals the new president favors. Instead, he pointed to the executive order Trump signed last week, his first, as proof of his commitment to undoing Obamacare's mandates and said his choice of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be his health and human services secretary "should speak volumes to people trying to understand what he's hoping to achieve." "This is not a technocrat," Bremberg said. "This is an experienced, compassionate doctor who has experienced the health-care system firsthand and who has been a leader here in Washington trying to address the policy reforms that need to take place. Having both of those in a secretary is going to be very important and very powerful." Even as Bremberg offered few details about what the president plans to do, he emphasized that last week's executive order "repeatedly" used phrases "such as 'to the maximum extent permitted by law' " to enable his political appointees to start dismantling the ACA by executive authority. "I'm sure many of us have been very concerned about the interpretation of that phrase in the last six or so years," Bremberg quipped, referring to the previous administration. "The president has now officially given direction [not only] to HHS, but to all of these agencies that have responsibility . . . to exercise all available discretion to begin helping the American people and to begin fixing our health-care system." The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bremberg's remarks. Faso warned that by defunding Planned Parenthood in the reconciliation bill, "we are arming our enemy in this debate." "To me, us taking retribution on Planned Parenthood is kind of morally akin to what Lois Lerner and Obama and the IRS did against tea party groups," he said, a reference to accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative political groups for audits. Faso continued: "Health insurance is going to be tough enough for us to deal with without having millions of people on social media come to Planned Parenthood's defense and sending hundreds of thousands of new donors to the Democratic Senate and Democratic congressional campaign committees. So I would just urge us to rethink this." The Washington Post's Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane contributed to this report.

Donald Trump's presidency has veered onto a road with no centerlines or guardrails. The president's accusation Saturday that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had tapped his phone "during the very sacred election process" escalated on Sunday into the White House's call for a congressional investigation of that evidence-free claim. The audacious tactic was a familiar one for Trump, who has little regard for norms and conventions. When he wants to change a subject, he often does it by touching a match to the dry tinder of a sketchy conspiracy theory. But the stakes have gotten higher, and the consequences more real and serious, as questions mount over Moscow's reported attempts to interfere with last year's presidential election. Trump's response also has deepened doubts about his own judgment, not just in the face of the first crisis to confront his young presidency but in dealing with the challenges that lie ahead for the chief executive of the world's most powerful nation. His tweets may have been an effort to distract from revelations that his aides and associates had contact with Russian officials during the election and transition, as well as to deflect criticism onto Obama. But instead, the president has invited more scrutiny to the larger controversy over Russian interference. The issue shows no signs of fading. FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request... FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request... So explosive was Trump's unsubstantiated wiretap accusation that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to take the extraordinary step of issuing a statement rebutting it, a U.S. official said, confirming a report Sunday in the New York Times. The process of obtaining permission to conduct a wiretap on an American in a foreign intelligence investigation is an arduous one. If it turns out that a government agency put one on Trump or individuals around him, an obvious question would be what evidence was used to justify the action. Trump's tweetstorm early Saturday made his disciplined, well-received speech to Congress four days before seem less a turning point than an aberration. "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!" Trump fired out, in the first of four tweets on the subject. "How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very... "How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very... The charge was reminiscent of the early days of his political ascendancy, when he built a political base by pandering to the fringes with false stories about Obama's birthplace. After he was elected with less than a popular majority, Trump made the groundless claim that millions of people had voted illegally. But the voice of a U.S. commander in chief carries far greater weight than that of just about anyone else on the planet. Trump's detractors say the way he uses that platform has worrisome implications that go far beyond the sensation he creates on social media and his ability to dominate the news. "We have as president a man who is erratic, vindictive, volatile, obsessive, a chronic liar, and prone to believe in conspiracy theories," said conservative commentator Peter Wehner, who was the top policy strategist in George W. Bush's White House. "And you can count on the fact that there will be more to come, since when people like Donald Trump gain power they become less, not more, restrained." Nor does Trump appear to have a governing apparatus around him that can temper and channel his impulses. "When the president goes off and does what he did within the last few days, of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there's something wrong. There's something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate," Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton and CIA director during the Obama administration, said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." Trump and his allies, however, say that the criticism is misdirected. In their view, the concern over Russian interference in the election has been overblown by Democrats looking for an excuse for Hillary Clinton's defeat last November. They also say that more focus should be concentrated on the people within the government who are leaking sensitive information to the news media. Within a government bureaucracy that tilts Democratic, "there is an active 'deep state' opposition to a populist disruptive reformer. Many believe it is their duty to break the law and lie," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich. "For Trump to succeed, there will have to be profound overhaul of the bureaucracy. To be normal in this environment is to fail." Still, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been unsettled by Trump's latest claims, which come amid investigations by the House and Senate intelligence committees and calls by some for more drastic measures, including a select committee, independent commission or special prosecutor. "It would be more helpful if he turned over to the Intelligence Committee any evidence that he has," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of that panel, said on "Face the Nation." "It would probably be helpful if he gave more information, but it also might be helpful if he just didn't comment further and allowed us to do our work." Some note that Trump now sits in the Oval Office in large part because voters did not want another conventional politician in the job. "A lot of this outrage that's out there is because Donald Trump is doing what Donald Trump said he was going to do if he was elected," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who ran against Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, said on "Meet the Press." Yet Trump's accusations may well inflame - rather than calm - another sentiment that abounds in the country. "This is exceedingly problematic. We were already in a huge deficit as to what the country trusted out of Washington and our leaders," said Matthew Dowd, who has been a strategist for both Democratic and Republican politicians. "This only adds to it," Dowd said. "We're in a surreal world."

"How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling." -- White House press secretary Sean Spicer, statement, March 5 Trump's explosive allegation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him is based on -- what? That's been the question since a series of provocative early morning tweets by the president, since he and his staff have provided no evidence. At The Fact Checker, we require the accuser to provide the evidence for a dramatic claim. We asked on Saturday and received no answer. However, in calling for a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the election to also investigate this claim, Spicer on Sunday referred to "reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations." That suggests the tweets were based on media reports, not information the president might have received from inside the government. Our Washington Post colleague Robert Costa has reported that White House aides have internally circulated an article on Breitbart titled: "Mark Levin to Congress: Investigate Obama's 'Silent Coup' vs. Trump." Breitbart is a right-leaning news organization that is a rather unreliable source of information. Often the material that is published is derivative and twisted in misleading ways. However, a White House spokesman told The Fact Checker that the White House instead is relying on reports "from BBC, Heat St., New York Times, Fox News, among others." He provided a list of five articles. Let's explore the sources of the president's claim. We are going to start with the Breitbart article, which lists two key data points that appear to relate to the president's claim: "June 2016: FISA request. The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers. The request, uncharacteristically, is denied. "October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found - but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services." But these data points are not based on reporting by Breitbart. Instead Breitbart links to a report which appeared in Heat Street, another right-leaning news organization: "EXCLUSIVE: FBI 'Granted FISA Warrant' Covering Trump Camp's Ties To Russia." It was written by Louise Mensch, a former Tory member of the British Parliament and an independent journalist. This is one of the news reports identified by the White House, and it's the most important one. This article claimed: "Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia." Mensch claimed that the warrant was related to an FBI investigation of a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank - an investigation that, as far as anyone knows, went nowhere. "The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server (in Trump Tower) and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank. However, it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any 'US person' connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates," Mensch wrote. The Washington Post for months has sought to confirm this report of a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign but has been unable to do so. Presumably other U.S. news organizations have tried to do so as well. So one has to take this claim with a huge dose of skepticism. Indeed, the New York Times reported before the election that the FBI "ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts" with the Russian banks. Interestingly, as far as we can tell, only two other reports have touched on this FISA claim, and they also have British connections. One is a report in the BBC from January, which the White House also cited as a source. The BBC reported: "Lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice then drew up an application. They took it to the secret US court that deals with intelligence, the FISA court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They wanted permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks. "Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 October, three weeks before election day. "Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the FISA order, which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities - in this case the Russian banks. But ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States, each one, if proved, a felony offense. "A lawyer - outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case - told me that three of Mr Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry. 'But it's clear this is about Trump,' he said." Finally, there was a report in The Guardian, which reported on the supposed June FISA request, but could not confirm the October one. (The White House did not cite the Guardian.) "The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The FISA court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation." The White House provided three other sources. Two, a National Review article and a Fox News interview, are simply derivative of the Heat Street article, with no independent confirmation. The third is a New York Times report that intelligence agencies "are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions" as part of a probe of possible links between Russian officials and Trump campaign aides. (We recall the president has previously deemed Times reporting on this matter as "fake news.") So what do we have here? Only two articles, both with British roots, have reported that a FISA court order was granted in October to examine possible activity between two Russian banks and a computer server in the Trump Tower. This claim has not been confirmed by any U.S. news organizations. Moreover, neither article says Obama requested the order or that it resulted in the tapping of Trump's phone lines. Moreover, the articles do not support the White House's claim that these were "potentially politically motivated investigations" led by Obama. The articles all suggest the FISA requests - if they happened - were done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI. The BBC says the investigation was prompted by a tip from a Baltic country about possible criminal activity: "Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was - allegedly - a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign. "It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States. The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence task force was created." While the Trump White House cited five news reports to justify its request for a congressional investigation, only two actually are relevant. It's certainly ironic that the Trump White House - which has heavily criticized articles relying on anonymous sources - now relies on articles based on anonymous sources that cites information that has not been confirmed by any U.S. news organization. It would be amusing if it were not so sad. Even if these reports are accepted as accurate, neither back up Trump's claims that Obama ordered the tapping of his phone calls. Moreover, they also do not back up the administration's revised claim of politically motivated investigations. We're still waiting for the evidence.

President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a "Nixon/Watergate" plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters in the run-up to last fall's election, providing no evidence to support his explosive claim and drawing a flat denial from Obama's office. Leveling the extraordinary allegation about his predecessor in a series of four early morning tweets, Trump said Obama had been "wire tapping" his New York offices and suggested that the former president had meddled with the "very sacred election process." Obama's supposed actions, Trump said, amounted to McCarthyism. "Bad (or sick) guy!" the 45th president tweeted about the 44th, insisting that the surveillance efforts resulted in "nothing found." Senior U.S. officials with knowledge of a wide-ranging federal investigation into Russian interference in the election, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information, said Saturday that there had been no wiretap of Trump. Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama, said in a statement: "A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false." Officials at the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. According to senior administration officials, White House Counsel Donald McGahn and his office are inquiring about possible surveillance of then-candidate Trump while being sensitive to legal and national security considerations. "They will handle appropriately," one official said. It could not be immediately determined whether there had been wiretaps of anyone in Trump's orbit who might be a subject of the Russia probe. Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., told MSNBC on Friday that he believes "transcripts" exist that would show whether Russian officials colluded with Trump's campaign. Wiretaps in a foreign intelligence probe cannot legally be directed at a U.S. facility without probable cause - reviewed by a federal judge - that the phone lines or Internet addresses at the facility were being used by agents of a foreign power or by someone spying for or acting on behalf of a foreign government. Ben Rhodes, a longtime national security adviser to Obama, tweeted at Trump: "No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you." Wiretaps on Americans in foreign intelligence investigations are not easy to get. And if you're a candidate for president, it's even harder. That's the experience of current and former senior U.S. officials who on Saturday expressed disbelief at President Donald Trump's accusation - leveled without... Wiretaps on Americans in foreign intelligence investigations are not easy to get. And if you're a candidate for president, it's even harder. That's the experience of current and former senior U.S. officials who on Saturday expressed disbelief at President Donald Trump's accusation - leveled without... Neither Trump nor his aides offered any citation to back up Trump's accusation about Obama. Trump may have been prompted by a report on the conservative website Breitbart and commentary from talk radio host Mark Levin suggesting that the Obama administration used "police state" tactics to monitor the Trump team. The Breitbart report circulated among Trump's senior aides Friday and early Saturday, and Trump may have simply been reacting to the piece when he took to his preferred megaphone, Twitter, to trumpet his claim. Trump's tweets punctuated a general feeling shared by the president, his advisers and allies that Obama and the "Deep State" of critics within the intelligence community - who they think are fueling stories on Trump and Russia - have been conspiring to derail his presidency. At the heart of each of the president's tweets is Trump's apparent belief that Obama himself - as opposed to members of his administration - had been personally overseeing surveillance of Trump Tower. The conservative media landscape - including Sean Hannity's show on Fox News and Infowars, the conspiracy website run by Alex Jones, outlets on which Trump has appeared - has in recent days given birth to tales of Obama and his closest confidants trying to spur Trump's impeachment or force his resignation. But separately, the president is furious that a slow churn of revelations about communications between Attorney General Jeff Sessions, ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and other Trump associates and Russian officials has overshadowed the early weeks of his administration. And he has grown fixated on identifying leakers. "He's angry, and he thinks that the leaks - even forgetting the rhetoric on politics - are a significant problem that hurts the security of the country," said Thomas Barrack Jr., a close friend who chaired Trump's inauguration. "He feels if he can't rely on his team, if he were negotiating with North Korea on something sensitive and death by a thousand leaks continued, he views that as really being disruptive to the security of America." Trump has directed his aides to investigate employees across the federal government, with a particular focus on holdovers from the Obama administration and career intelligence officers, who Trump believes are trying to sabotage him. A few minutes before the sun rose over Mar-a-Lago, President Trump was up, thumbing a series of tweets about Barack Obama and some of the darker days of 20th century American history. In particular, he was making accusations that Obama had tapped the phones in Trump tower just before the 2016 election... A few minutes before the sun rose over Mar-a-Lago, President Trump was up, thumbing a series of tweets about Barack Obama and some of the darker days of 20th century American history. In particular, he was making accusations that Obama had tapped the phones in Trump tower just before the 2016 election... White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has been in close touch with the president about what he has called the Deep State. Bannon's remarks in a recent speech about the "deconstruction of the administrative state" were designed in part to raise alarm among activists on the right about entrenched bureaucrats in the intelligence and defense agencies, according to White House officials. Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to Trump who does not work in the administration but still talks with the president, said he is urging Trump to fire and prosecute anyone who leaks damaging information. "What the president doesn't understand is he has more power than he knows," Stone said. "He needs to clean house. Just clean house! Hand the pink slips to everybody. . . . Lock them out of their offices and tell the FBI to start going through their emails and phone messages." Trump was incensed overSessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe after The Washington Post reported that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador but then testified falsely at his Senate confirmation hearing that he "did not have communications with the Russians." In the Oval Office on Friday morning, Trump fumed at his senior staff about the Sessions situation and told them that he disagreed with the attorney general's move, according to senior White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump told aides that he thought the White House and Justice Department should have done more to counter the argument that Sessions needed to step away. Trump said he wanted to see his staff fight back against what he saw as a widespread effort to destabilize his presidency, the officials said. In typical Donald Trump fashion, the president tweeted Saturday that his replacement at the "The New Celebrity Apprentice" reality television show is to blame for its poor ratings and not, as Arnold Schwarzenegger says, Trump's continued involvement with the show. Schwarzenegger, who replaced Trump... In typical Donald Trump fashion, the president tweeted Saturday that his replacement at the "The New Celebrity Apprentice" reality television show is to blame for its poor ratings and not, as Arnold Schwarzenegger says, Trump's continued involvement with the show. Schwarzenegger, who replaced Trump... Trump then departed for Palm Beach, Florida - in what one associate described as "a [expletive] bad mood" - to spend the weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago Club, where he fired off Saturday morning's tweets alleging wiretaps. Trump amended his public schedule Saturday to add an early evening meeting with Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, as well as dinner with both men and other advisers, including Bannon. If the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved a wiretapping order on one of Trump's associates, that would mean the federal judge involved had decided there was probable cause that the person was colluding with a foreign government. Some current and former intelligence officials cast doubt on Trump's wiretapping assertion. "It's extremely unlikely that there would have been any sort of criminal or intelligence surveillance of Trump," said Jennifer Daskal, a former senior Justice Department national security official. "There's no credible evidence yet to suggest that that happened. It would be an extraordinary measure for the FBI to ask for and the court to grant a surveillance order on a presidential candidate of the opposing party in an election year." Most Republican leaders were quiet on the issue Saturday, but Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vowed at a town hall meeting with constituents to "get to the bottom of this." He said it would be "the biggest scandal since Watergate" if Obama illegally spied on Trump or if a judge approved a warrant to monitor Trump's campaign for possible communications with Russia. "I'm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally," Graham said. At the same time, because of what it would signal, "I would be very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments." Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called for Trump to provide the public more information about his charges. "We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the President's allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots," Sasse said in a statement. Democrats, meanwhile, blasted Trump. Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the president leveled a "spectacularly reckless allegation" against Obama without evidence. Referencing Trump's description of Obama as a "bad (or sick) guy," Schiff said in a statement, "If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them." Daskal, who now teaches law at American University, agreed. "It is extremely dangerous for the president to be suggesting that he was being surveilled for political purposes, when there is absolutely no evidence of that fact," she said. The Washington Post's Jenna Portnoy in Palm Beach, Fla., and David Weigel and Matt Zapotosky in Washington contributed to this report.

House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes says President Donald Trump's allegations that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower last year will become part of his panel's investigation. Trump has offered no evidence or details to support his claim, and Obama's spokesman has denied it. The California Republican says in a statement his committee "will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates." The committee was already investigating Russian interference in the presidential election. Here's reaction to the White House's demand Sunday that Congress, through its intelligence committees, investigate whether former President Barack Obama abused his executive powers in connection with that campaign. "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling. President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the president will comment further until such oversight is conducted." — White House press secretary Sean Spicer, in a statement. FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so.

FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request... "Perhaps the president has information that is not yet available to us or to the public. And, if it's true, obviously, we're going to find out very quickly. And, if it isn't, then, obviously, he'll have to explain what he meant by it." — Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on CNN's "State of the Union." "I will say that, for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign." — James Clapper, director of national intelligence under Obama, on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I don't have any doubt that President Obama has been telling the truth." — Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, on NBC. "It's called a wrap-up smear. You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge. It's a tool of an authoritarian." — House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, on CNN. "I think he's going off of information that he's seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential. And if it is, this is the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself." — Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, on ABC's "This Week." "We know exactly why President Trump tweeted what he tweeted. Because there is one page in the Trump White House crisis management playbook. And that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal." — Former Obama press secretary Josh Earnest, on ABC. "We've already begun an inquiry on the Intelligence Committee into Russia's efforts to undermine confidence in our political system last year and in our interest all around the world. That inquiry is going to be thorough, and we're going to follow the facts wherever they lead us. And I'm sure that this matter will be a part of that inquiry." — Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on "Fox News Sunday." "I thought the president's comments could no longer surprise me, but, boy, this one yesterday surprised me. To make that type of claim without any evidence is, I think, very reckless." — Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on CBS' "Face the Nation." "It is so important that we do an in-depth, exhaustive, bipartisan, independent investigation, because the American people deserve answers to all of these allegations and counterallegations, so that we can get on with the business of this country." — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on CBS. "One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign. As such, the committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it." — Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement. "For a president of the United States to make such an incendiary charge — and one that discredits our democracy in the eyes of the world — is as destructive as it was baseless." — California Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement.

Wiretaps on Americans in foreign intelligence investigations are not easy to get. And if you're a candidate for president, it's even harder. That's the experience of current and former senior U.S. officials who on Saturday expressed disbelief at President Donald Trump's accusation - leveled without any evidence - that President Barack Obama had him wiretapped at Trump Tower before the November election. Senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such matters are classified, said that there had been no wiretap on Trump. Under the law governing foreign-intelligence surveillance inside the United States, an FBI agent would need to show a federal judge that there is probable cause that the target is an "agent of a foreign power" - and that requires more than just talking to, say, the Russian ambassador. "Both criminal and foreign intelligence wiretaps have onerous and strict processes of approval that require not only multiple levels of internal Justice Department review, but also require court review and approval," said Matthew Waxman, an expert on national security law at Columbia University. The law authorizing wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases is known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, passed out of reforms recommended by the Church Committee in the wake of spying abuses by the FBI and the National Security Agency. President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a "Nixon/Watergate" plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters in the run-up to last fall's election, providing no evidence to support his explosive claim and drawing a flat denial from... President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a "Nixon/Watergate" plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters in the run-up to last fall's election, providing no evidence to support his explosive claim and drawing a flat denial from... The law bars targeted electronic surveillance on U.S. soil unless the government can show that the target was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, and that the "facility" - the phone number or email address in question - is being used by the foreign power or agent. The law authorizing criminal intercepts - in cases such as murder, drug dealing or racketeering - is Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Like FISA, the law requires probable cause, but in this instance that the target is about to or has committed a crime. In a national security case, the FBI working with attorneys in the Justice Department's National Security Division prepare a declaration laying out their grounds for seeking a FISA order. A senior intelligence official, typically the FBI or CIA director, must certify that the purpose is to collect foreign intelligence and that the information cannot be obtained by normal investigative means. Then the package must be approved by a senior Justice official. Only three have authority to approve the order: the attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the head of the National Security Division. An NSD attorney would then present the application to a judge of the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, made up of 11 federal district judges appointed by the chief justice of the United States. They sit in rotation, one judge at a time, typically for a week. The court's proceedings are highly classified, and generally the court hears only the government's side of the case. Following the revelations of widespread NSA surveillance by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, Congress in 2015 created an "amicus curiae," or public advocate, whom the judge can ask to weigh in on significant interpretations of FISA. FISA orders rarely are rejected, in part because lawyers will withdraw or amend an order if a judge signals it will not pass muster. Once approved, the order is served on the phone or Internet company that handles the number or email address in question. On average, in recent years, there have been about 1,400 to 2,300 FISA orders a year. Each order can contain multiple names and numbers or email addresses. In a criminal case, a federal prosecutor goes before a federal magistrate and presents an application for a "Title III" order. In 2015, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, there were 1,400 wiretap orders, covering one or more devices. Some experts, though, citing phone company transparency reports, say the office's number appears low. In the old days, FBI agents would attach alligator clips to phone lines. Today, a technician at a phone company will type into a computer system the number or email address, digitally creating another line that goes to an FBI listening post. The FBI has separate facilities for criminal wiretaps and national security intercepts. The latter are generally recorded for transcription. Criminal wiretaps are listened to in real time. Under Title III, if an agent hears a target talking to someone not involved in the crime - like a pizza deliverer, he or she is required to hang up. Under FISA, any information that does not have "foreign intelligence" value must be "minimized" or masked in the transcript. That includes the names of U.S. citizens who are picked up speaking to the target unless their identities are relevant to understanding the foreign intelligence. In a typical counterintelligence investigation, if an agent is trying to figure out a target's network, conversations - even those that might appear innocuous at first - are more likely to be considered relevant. Thus the minimization rules for national-security wiretaps are more lenient than those for criminal wiretaps because spies and terrorists generally use more sophisticated tradecraft to evade surveillance. The communications of people who are speaking to the target are termed "incidental." The FBI, for instance, routinely wiretaps the foreign embassies of major adversaries such as China and Russia - including intercepting the cellphone conversations of senior diplomats. Anyone speaking to any of these targets would have their conversations picked up as incidental collection. It is possible, some former officials said, that there may be recordings of phone conversations between someone in Trump Tower and a Russian official or officials. If so, the most likely explanation is that the surveillance was being conducted on the Russian officials, who historically have been under court-authorized FISA surveillance. Those talking to the target would have had their conversations picked up as incidental collection.

Facing a Monday deadline, the Justice Department asked lawmakers for more time to provide evidence backing up President Donald Trump's unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. The request came as the White House appeared to soften Trump's explosive allegation. The House intelligence committee said it would give the Justice Department until March 20 to comply with the evidence request. That's the date of the committee's first open hearing on the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia. A spokesman for the committee's Republican chairman said that if the Justice Department doesn't meet the new deadline, the panel might use its subpoena power to gather information. "If the committee does not receive a response by then, the committee will ask for this information during the March 20 hearing and may resort to a compulsory process if our questions continue to go unanswered," said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says she doesn't have any evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phone lines during the election.

Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says she doesn't have any evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phone lines during the election. Instead, Conway is pointing to recent revelations about other government surveillance to suggest it... Trump's assertions have put his administration in a bind. Current and former administration officials have been unable to provide any evidence of the Obama administration wiretapping Trump Tower, yet the president's aides have been reluctant to publicly contradict their boss. White House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to clarify Trump's comments Monday, saying the president wasn't using the word wiretapping literally, noting that Trump had put the term in quotation marks. "The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities," Spicer said. He also suggested Trump wasn't accusing former President Barack Obama specifically, but instead referring to the actions of the Obama administration. Trump himself has not commented on the matter since his March 4 tweets, in which he said he had "just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory." He also wrote: "Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president?" In two other tweets, Trump described Obama tapping his phones, but did not put the phrases in quotation marks. The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its namesake has charged, a request reinforced Sunday by an influential Republican senator who says the president must either come up with the evidence... The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its namesake has charged, a request reinforced Sunday by an influential Republican senator who says the president must either come up with the evidence... The president's accusations against Obama came amid numerous political questions surrounding his associates' possible ties to Russia. The FBI is investigating Trump associates' contacts with Russia during the election, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. The White House has asked those committees to also investigate Trump's unverified wiretapping allegations against Obama. The House committee has turned the matter back on the Trump administration, setting the Monday deadline for the Justice Department to provide evidence. In a response Monday evening, the Justice Department said it needed extra time to "review the request in compliance with the governing legal authorities and to determine what if any responsive documents may exist." Other congressional committees are also pushing the administration to clarify Trump's claims. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente and FBI Director James Comey to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department's criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps. The senators, who head the Senate Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee, are seeking warrant applications and court orders, which they said can be scrubbed to protect secret intelligence sources and methods. Trump's critics have slammed the president for making the wiretapping claim on his Twitter account without evidence. Wiretapping a U.S. citizen would require special permission from a court, and Trump as president would have the ability to declassify that information. Sen. John McCain, an influential Republican, said Sunday: "I think the president has one of two choices: either retract or to provide the information that the American people deserve." "If his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least," McCain said. Comey has privately urged the Justice Department to dispute Trump's claim but has not come forward to do so himself. James Clapper, who was Obama's director of national intelligence, has said that nothing matching Trump's claims had taken place. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway sidestepped questions about the lack of proof Monday, saying she was "not in the job of having evidence." "That's what investigations are for," Conway told CNN's "New Day." "The president is pleased that the House and Senate intelligence committees have agreed that this should be part of the investigation that already exists about Russia and the campaign, an investigation that apparently has gone nowhere so far." In a weekend interview with the Bergen Record, a newspaper in her home state of New Jersey, Conway appeared to point toward the recent WikiLeaks release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA's tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs. "What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other now, unfortunately," including "microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera," Conway said. "So we know that that is just a fact of modern life." Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.

Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says she doesn't have any evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower phone lines during the election. Instead, Conway is pointing to recent revelations about other government surveillance to suggest it was possible Obama used a different technique. Her response was unlikely to tamp down criticism of Trump's tweets earlier this month. The House intelligence committee has asked the administration to provide evidence of the allegation by Monday. "The answer is I don't have any evidence and I'm very happy that the House intelligence committee (is) investigating," Conway told ABC's "Good Morning America." She later tweeted that the administration is "pleased" with the ongoing congressional investigation and "will comment after." Trump's critics have slammed the president for making the explosive wiretapping claim on his Twitter account without evidence.

The House intelligence committee is asking the Trump administration for evidence that the phones at Trump Tower were tapped during the campaign as its namesake has charged, a request reinforced Sunday by an influential Republican senator who says the president must either come up with the evidence or retract his claim. "I think the president has one of two choices: either retract or to provide the information that the American people deserve, because, if his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least," Sen. John McCain said. President Donald Trump asserted in a tweet last week: "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!" He continued the allegation against former President Barack Obama in other tweets but offered no evidence. The request for evidence by Monday was made in a letter sent to the Justice Department by the House committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and the panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a senior congressional aide said Saturday. The aide wasn't authorized to discuss the request by name and requested anonymity. Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, has said that nothing matching Trump's claims had taken place, but that has not quelled speculation that Trump's communications were monitored by the Obama administration. Trump has asked Congress to investigate. Early this past week, Schiff said the committee would answer the president's call to investigate the claim. He also said he would ask FBI Director James Comey directly when he appears later this month before the full committee, which is investigating Russian activities during the election. On Sunday, Schiff said he doubted there was any evidence of wiretapping, but that Comey and others called to testify at the upcoming hearing "would be in a position to have to know."

"I think on March 20 if not before we'll be able to put this to rest," Schiff told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week." ''I don't think anyone has any question about this, George. The only question is why the president would make up such a thing." McCain said Trump could "clear this up in a minute" if he were to call "the director of the CIA, director of national intelligence and say, 'OK, what happened?'" The president has an obligation to provide evidence that Obama broke the law or retract his claim, the Arizona Republican said. "I do believe on issues such as this, accusing a former president of the United States of something which is not only illegal, but just unheard of, that requires corroboration. I'll let the American people be the judge, but this is serious stuff," McCain said on CNN's "State of the Union." Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said Sunday on Fox News Channel's "MediaBuzz that the House and Senate intelligence committees have agreed to investigate and "we'll make a comment after those findings are complete." Nunes has said that so far he has not seen any evidence to back up Trump's claim and has suggested the news media were taking the president's weekend tweets too literally. "The president is a neophyte to politics — he's been doing this a little over a year," Nunes told reporters this past week. Other lawmakers also have asked for evidence. Declaring that Congress "must get to the bottom" of Trump's claim, Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Comey and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department's criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps.

Trump tweeted last weekend that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones at Trump Tower during the election. But Trump offered no evidence to back up the accusation. Through a spokesman, Obama said neither he nor any White House official had ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said nothing matching Trump's claims had taken place. Following Trump's tweet, FBI Director James Comey privately asked the Justice Department to dispute the president's claim because he believed the allegations to be false. As the chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary crime and terrorism subcommittee, Graham and Whitehouse said they would take very seriously "any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political reasons." But, they added, "We would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower."

The senators are seeking warrant applications and court orders, which they said can be scrubbed to protect secret intelligence sources and methods. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told Iowa reporters in a Wednesday telephone call that he needs to be able to "sort fact from fiction" before making any decisions about Trump's wiretapping allegation. Grassley also said he's waiting to receive a briefing from Comey, who told the senator earlier this week that he's awaiting clearance from the Justice Department. The House and Senate Intelligence committees, and the FBI, are investigating contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian officials, as well as whether Moscow tried to influence the 2016 election. Trump demanded that they broaden the scope of their inquiries to include Obama's potential abuse of executive powers.

Comey made the request... The ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, Sen. Mark Warner, spent a couple hours Wednesday at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., reviewing material for the committee's investigation into Russia's meddling in the election and possible contacts that Trump associates had with Russians. Other committee members, including Sens. Angus King, I-Maine, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also went to the CIA to read material Wednesday. Staffers on the House intelligence committee have been making trips there too to look at documents for their parallel investigation. Asked if he learned anything that might alter direction of the investigation, Warner said: "Some of the things begged more questions." Graham and Whitehouse acknowledged Trump's desire for the intelligence committees to have purview, but they argued that their subcommittee has oversight of the Justice Department's criminal division. Graham has been a frequent critic of Trump's push for closer ties with Moscow. After Trump's victory in November, he pledged to use his position in the Republican majority to investigate what he called "Russia's misadventures throughout the world."

President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court nominee in a quarter-century. He's known on the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals for clear, colloquial writing, advocacy for court review of government regulations, defense of religious freedom and skepticism toward law enforcement. "Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support," Trump declared, announcing the nomination in his first televised prime-time address from the White House. Gorsuch's nomination was cheered by conservatives wary of Trump's own fluid ideology. If confirmed by the Senate, he will fill the seat left vacant by the death last year of Antonin Scalia, long the right's most powerful voice on the high court. With Scalia's wife, Maureen, sitting in the audience, Trump took care to praise the late justice. Gorsuch followed, calling Scalia a "lion of the law." President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Jan. 31, 2017. Gorsuch thanked Trump for entrusting him with "a most solemn assignment." And he said, "Standing here in a house of history, I'm acutely aware of my own imperfections and pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution of laws of this great country." Some Democrats, still smarting over Trump's unexpected victory in the presidential election, have vowed to mount a vigorous challenge to nearly any nominee to what they view as the court's "stolen seat." President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland for the vacancy after Scalia's death, but Senate Republicans refused to consider the pick, saying the seat should be filled only after the November election. Trump's choice of Gorsuch marks perhaps the most significant decision of his young presidency, one with ramifications that could last long after he leaves office. After an uneven start to his presidency, including the chaotic rollout last week of a controversial refugee and immigration ban, Trump's selection of Gorsuch appeared to proceed with little drama. For some Republicans, the prospect of filling one or more Supreme Court seats over the next four years has helped ease their concerns about Trump's experience and temperament. Three justices are in their late 70s and early 80s, and a retirement would offer Trump the opportunity to cement conservative dominance of the court for many years. If confirmed, Gorsuch will restore the court to the conservative tilt it held with Scalia on the bench. But he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on abortion, gay marriage and other issues in which the court has been divided 5-4 in recent years. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch has won praise from conservatives for his defense of religious freedom. In two cases that involved the contraception mandate under the Obama health care law, he sided with businesses and nonprofit groups that voiced religious objections to the requirement that they provide cost-free birth control to women covered under their health plans. The judge also has written opinions that question 30 years of Supreme Court rulings that allow federal agencies to interpret laws and regulations. Gorsuch has said that federal bureaucrats have been allowed to accumulate too much power at the expense of Congress and the courts. Like Scalia, Gorsuch identifies himself as a judge who tries to decide cases by interpreting the Constitution and laws as they were understood when written. He also has raised questions about criminal laws in a way that resembles Scalia's approach to criminal law. University of Michigan law professor Richard Primus said Gorsuch "may be the closest thing the new generation of conservative judges has to Antonin Scalia." Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia.

Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George... Gorsuch, like the other eight justices on the court, has an Ivy League law degree. The Colorado native earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in three years, then a law degree from Harvard. He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White, a fellow Coloradan, and Anthony Kennedy before earning a philosophy degree at Oxford University and working for a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm. He served for two years in George W. Bush's Department of Justice before the president nominated him to the appeals court. His mother was Anne Gorsuch, who was head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Reagan administration. Gorsuch is expected to face intense scrutiny from Democrats. Some liberals have demanded that Democrats block any Trump choice, underscoring the deep partisan discord surging through Washington. "Now is not the time for business as usual," MoveOn.org's Ilya Sheyman said in a statement. Neil M. Gorsuch, a highly regarded conservative jurist best known for upholding religious liberty rights in the legal battles over Obamacare, is President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Neil M. Gorsuch, a highly regarded conservative jurist best known for upholding religious liberty rights in the legal battles over Obamacare, is President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Gorsuch was among the 21 possible choices for the court Trump released during the campaign. Other finalists also came from that list, including Thomas Hardiman, who serves alongside Trump's sister on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and William Pryor, a federal appeals court judge and Alabama's attorney general from 1997 to 2004. If Democrats decide to filibuster Gorsuch's nomination, his fate could rest in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump has encouraged McConnell to change the rules of the Senate and make it impossible to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee — a change known in the Senate as the "nuclear option." A conservative group already has announced plans to begin airing $2 million worth of ads in support of the nominee in Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota, four states that Trump won and in which Democrats will be defending their Senate seats in 2018.

President Donald Trump has chosen his first nominee, but it remains Justice Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court. The question is how much longer he wants it. Kennedy, 80 and celebrating his 29th year on the court this month, will remain the pivotal member of the court no matter how the warfare between Republicans and Democrats plays out. On almost every big social issue, neither the court's liberal, Democratic-appointed justices nor Kennedy's fellow Republican-appointed conservative colleagues can prevail without him. That is why an undercurrent of Trump's first choice for the court was whether it would soothe Kennedy, making him feel secure enough to retire and let this president choose the person who would succeed him. "Justice Kennedy tries not to play politics with these things," said one of Kennedy's former clerks, who watches the court carefully. Like others, he would not talk for attribution about his old boss. "But obviously he will feel more comfortable if the person who is picked is someone he likes and respects, just as the opposite would give him pause." Who better, then, to put Kennedy at ease than one of his former clerks? Kennedy trekked to Denver to swear in his protege Neil Gorsuch on the appeals court 10 years ago. If Gorsuch is confirmed to the Supreme Court, it would be the first time that a justice has served with a former clerk. Gorsuch on Tuesday evening praised the "incredibly welcoming and gracious" Kennedy, along with his other judicial mentors, the late Justice Byron White and Judge David Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. "These judges brought me up in the law," he said. "Truly I would not be here without them." Trump campaigned for office expertly on the Supreme Court, which is especially important to conservatives and evangelicals. He went so far as to say that even if voters did not like him, they had no choice but to support him because of the potential to shape the court for a generation. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83 and Justice Stephen Breyer is 78. They are two of the court's four liberals and are not likely to leave the court voluntarily while Trump is in charge. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump nominated federal Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on Tuesday to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Antonin Scalia. Some say Kennedy would be reluctant to leave, too, if it meant a more conservative court that would reverse some of his landmark decisions, especially on gay rights. But others who know him suggest he is ready to go. "I would put it at 50-50 that he leaves at the end of the term," said another former clerk. Kennedy recently hired clerks for the term that begins in October, but that is seen more as insurance than intent. The gentlemanly Kennedy could not be more different from the bombastic Trump, and so some involved in filling the current Supreme Court opening kept the justice in mind during the process. Pleasing Kennedy is wise but not dispositive, as lawyers at the court like to say. "I suppose he's more focused on the Trump administration as a whole," said another former clerk. "I think that will be more important to him than whether he likes this particular pick or not." All agree that it will not be Trump's first Supreme Court pick who will seal the court's ideological direction for a generation. It will be, if it happens, his second. Gorsuch, like almost anyone on Trump's list of 21 candidates to take Antonin Scalia's spot, is likely to replicate the late justice's voting pattern (if not his style). That would restore the court's long-held position as a generally conservative body capable of the occasional liberal surprise. President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come.

President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch, a fast-rising conservative judge with a writer's flair, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. At 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court... Those surprises are almost always supplied by Kennedy, nominated to the court by fellow Californian Ronald Reagan. Overall, Kennedy most often votes with the court's conservatives: He is further to the right on law-and-order issues than Scalia was, he is comfortable with the court's protective view of business, and he shared the losing view that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. But when the court moves left, it is because Kennedy joins its liberals - Ginsburg, Breyer, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. So Gorsuch's appointment would return the court to the status quo that existed before Scalia died. After that, the court's next appointment could mean a definitive shift. The Supreme Court without Breyer, Ginsburg or Kennedy would be a different place, indeed. They have been part of the scant majority that forbade the death penalty for minors and the intellectually disabled, and found established a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. When environmentalists win, which is becoming increasingly rare, it is because this group has banded together. Just last term, Kennedy and the liberals struck down a Texas law that they said used protecting women as a pretext for making abortion unavailable, and they continued a limited endorsement of affirmative action. Many if not all of those holdings would be at risk in a court with five consistent conservatives, the oldest being 68-year-old Justice Clarence Thomas.

Neil Gorsuch, named Tuesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, has a solidly conservative pedigree that has earned him comparison to the combative justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court justices and worked in President George... Kennedy's role was especially important this past term. Before writing his opinion in the University of Texas affirmative-action case, Kennedy had never approved of a race-conscious program, although he had not been as willing as his colleagues to outlaw the use of race in such processes. And prior to striking down the Texas abortion law, he had disapproved of only one statute on the issue - requiring a woman to inform her husband of her decision to have the procedure - among dozens the court had reviewed. As had happened so many times before, Kennedy had the biggest impact on the most important cases. How long that continues is bigger than the current opening.

Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, has been on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. Here are summaries of some of his notable opinions: Gorsuch voted with a majority of the 10th Circuit in favor of privately held for-profit secular corporations, and individuals who owned or controlled them, who raised religious objections to paying for contraception for women covered under their health plans. Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion in which he explained the moral dilemma facing the family that owns Hobby Lobby. "As they understand it, ordering their companies to provide insurance coverage for drugs or devices whose use is inconsistent with their faith itself violates their faith, representing a degree of complicity their religion disallows... No doubt, the Greens' religious convictions are contestable. Some may even find the Greens' beliefs offensive. But no one disputes that they are sincerely held religious beliefs," he wrote. Gorsuch was on the losing end of a vote by the full 10th Circuit over whether to rehear the case of a man who was convicted of having a gun after having earlier been convicted of a serious crime. The issue was whether the defendant knew that his earlier conviction was for a crime that disqualified him from owning a gun. Gorsuch argued in favor of a new hearing. "None of these arguments compels us to perpetuate the injustice of disregarding the plain terms of the law Congress wrote and denying defendants the day in court that law promises them." In this 2016 case, Gorsuch wrote for a panel of judges who sided with a Mexican citizen who was seeking permission to live in the U.S. The case gave Gorsuch an opportunity to raise an issue he has championed in his time as a judge: whether courts should so readily defer to federal agencies in determining what laws and regulations mean. Referring to high-court cases that Gorsuch believes cede too much power to agencies, he wrote: "There's an elephant in the room with us today. We have studiously attempted to work our way around it and even left it unremarked. But the fact is Chevron and Brand X permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth." Associated Press

President Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary, in written responses to questions from senators, appears to have used several sentences and phrases from other sources without attribution -- including from a top Obama administration civil rights official. The responses from nominee Betsy DeVos were submitted Monday to the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is voting Tuesday morning on her confirmation. In answering a set of questions from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., on how she would address bullying of LGBTQ students, DeVos wrote: "Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, thrive, and grow." That sentence is almost identical to language used by Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division under Obama, in a press release announcing the administration's controversial guidance to schools on how to accommodate transgender students. "Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow," Gupta said in the May 2016 release. Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling... Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling... Trump transition officials who have handled DeVos' nomination did not respond to questions sent Tuesday morning about the questionnaire. The revelation comes as Democrats are making an all-out push against key Trump nominees -- including DeVos, Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and others. But Democrats cannot block those confirmations unless they can convince a handful of Republicans to break with the new president. DeVos has come under withering scrutiny from Democrats who have raised concerns about her advocacy for school privatization initiatives, her financial ties to the education industry and the seemingly weak grasp of federal civil rights laws she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing this month. Murray, D-Wash., declined to say whether she was aware of the issue or otherwise comment in a brief interview Tuesday morning. In a set of questions about her views on LGBTQ students, including about whether transgender students should be able to use bathrooms that match their gender identity, DeVos answered: "Every student deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, achieve and thrive and are not discriminated against. Period." That language is similar to language appearing in an article in a magazine published by ASCD, an organization devoted to education leadership. A crowd of teachers, parents and children gathered near the U.S. Capitol on Sunday to protest Betsy DeVos's nomination to be education secretary, calling the Michigan billionaire a threat to public education and urging the Senate to reject her. Using drums and noisemakers, the group of protesters... A crowd of teachers, parents and children gathered near the U.S. Capitol on Sunday to protest Betsy DeVos's nomination to be education secretary, calling the Michigan billionaire a threat to public education and urging the Senate to reject her. Using drums and noisemakers, the group of protesters... The article outlines what educators can do to create schools that are supportive of transgender students, and concludes: "You -- as an educator and an ally -- can dramatically shift the school climate to one that is safe, supportive, and inclusive: a place where all students can learn, achieve, and thrive." In other instances, answers that DeVos submitted to Murray in her 62-page response used text verbatim from federal statutes and Education Department materials without direct quotation. In one response, to a question about whether she would continue the practice of publishing a list of schools under Title IX civil rights investigations, DeVos said, "Opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has made a determination about the merits of the complaint." That language mirrors an Education Department website: "Opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination with regard to the merits of the complaint." Other responses refer to a requirement that the department's assistant secretary for civil rights "make an annual report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress summarizing the compliance and enforcement activities" of the department's Office of Civil Rights and that the assistant secretary is authorized "to collect or coordinate the collection of data necessary to ensure compliance with civil rights laws within the jurisdiction" of the civil rights office. Those are verbatim excerpts of a 1979 federal statute, but the law is not quoted or cited.

As Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin would have significant influence over the way the financial system, particularly Wall Street, operates. And the former Goldman Sachs banker indicated Wednesday that he would at least partially be relying on his time as a regional banker to guide his decisions. "We've been in the business of regional banking and we understand what it is to make loans," Mnuchin said in an CNBC interview, apparently referring to his time leading IndyMac, a bankrupt mortgage lender. "That's the engine of growth to small- and medium-size businesses." But Mnuchin's time at the bank, which was recently purchased by another regional lender, CIT, has quickly turned into one of the chief criticisms of his nomination by Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups. Mnuchin "is just another Wall Street insider," Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a joint statement. "That is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington - that is hypocrisy at its worst." And Mnuchin, who must be confirmed by the Senate, is also likely to face questions about how he would separate himself from CIT, a small business lender that is partially regulated by the Treasury Department. Mnuchin, who could not be immediately reached for comment, serves on the bank's board and has stock worth about $100 million in the company. Mnuchin is a Wall Street veteran who spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs before starting his own hedge fund, Dune Capital. He leapt into the banking industry when he led a group of investors in the purchase of lender, IndyMac, during the financial crisis. That bank was eventually bought by CIT. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department on Wednesday called reforming the nation's tax code his top priority, promising significant tax breaks for the middle class but no overall tax cut for high-income households. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and... President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department on Wednesday called reforming the nation's tax code his top priority, promising significant tax breaks for the middle class but no overall tax cut for high-income households. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and... His financial industry experience has heartened Wall Street insiders, but left some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups crying foul. Mnuchin "made himself enormously wealthy by cashing in on the country's financial collapse," Take on Wall Street, a progressive group calling for Wall Street reform, said in a statement. In a series of television interviews Wednesday, Mnuchin reflected fondly on his time as a regional banker. "Let me tell you one of the most proud aspects of my career was buying IndyMac during the financial crisis," he told CNBC. "We brought it from the government in a highly competitive six-month auction and we saved a lot of jobs and created a lot of opportunities." As part of the deal, federal regulators agreed to cover a significant share of the bank's losses - a guarantee that lasts through 2019. The bank - later renamed OneWest - has also repeatedly faced criticism over its attempts to foreclose on homeowners who were in the process of modifying their loans, among other practices. President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter. Mnuchin... President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter. Mnuchin... OneWest was sold to CIT last year for more than $3 billion, more than double what Mnuchin and the other investors paid for it. The CIT merger "was the first bank deal to be approved post-Dodd Frank over $50 billion," a threshold that puts the bank under tough regulatory scrutiny, Mnuchin noted. Advocacy groups complained that the merger would combine two banks scarred by the financial crisis. CIT had nearly collapsed in 2009 before receiving more than $2 billion in taxpayer bailout funds. It filed for bankruptcy a few months later after regulators refused to give the bank another bailout. "The same community groups protested against the deal and the regulators looked at the deal and thought it made sense," Mnuchin said. The merger vaulted CIT into an exclusive club: Financial institutions deemed so important that their failure could harm the economy or "too big to fail." The designation comes with a cost. CIT must now comply with tougher rules overseen by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators. Among the new requirements is an annual "stress test" in which large banks must prove they can have enough capital to continue operating during times of economic and financial turbulence and have a "living will" that would unwind their operations without harming the economy. The Federal Reserve gave a "qualitative objection" to CIT's plan earlier this year, the company said in a government filing. "We have begun our remediation efforts," the company said in its filing. But the tougher requirements, called for by 2010's financial reform law known as Dodd Frank, could be weakened during the Trump administration. On Wednesday, Mnuchin, called for a partial repeal of extensive banking industry regulations put in place after the Great Recession. The 2010 financial reform law should be simplified, he said during an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning. "We want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending, and that will be the number one priority on the regulatory side," said Mnuchin. As Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin would have significant influence on how any new rules are drawn, industry analysts said. "That designation may not mean much anymore once Donald Trump gets a hold of Dodd Frank," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. This also comes as the House is expected to pass legislation as soon as Thursday that would ease regulations on dozens of big banks, a move progressive groups worry could be the first step towards dismantling restrictions put in place after the financial crisis to rein in Wall Street. The legislation would eliminate the $50 billion threshold for additional regulation all together. The current system is arbitrary and should be replaced by a more "holistic" approach, said Matt Well, a spokesman for the Regional Bank Coalition, an industry group that has called for changes to Dodd Frank law. The proposed legislation "would allow regional banks to focus on their core business rather than on regulatory compliance, which is the current reality under Dodd-Frank," he said. "Regional banks are far less risky than their Wall Street counterparts and hence should not be forced to abide by the same complex compliance requirements." But the legislation would also give Mnuchin, as Treasury Secretary, more power to directly influence which banks receive additional regulatory scrutiny and limit the Federal Reserve's ability to act unilaterally to rein in a financial institution, said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform. If the legislation passed "then Mnuchin has a direct and personal role in deciding whether enhanced prudential standards are applied to CIT," he said. "It would be a very radical, new thing."

Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Democrats abruptly boycotted a Senate Finance Committee meeting called to vote on Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the Health nominee and Steve Mnuchin, Trump's Treasury selection, saying both had misled Congress about their financial backgrounds. The Democrats' action prevented the Finance panel from acting because under committee rules, 13 of its members — including at least one Democrat — must be present for votes. It was unclear when the panel would reschedule to votes. At the Senate Judiciary Committee, a meeting considering Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to be attorney general lasted so long — chiefly because of lengthy Democratic speeches — that Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the panel would meet again Wednesday. The meeting on Sessions' nomination was coming with Democrats and demonstrators around the country in an uproar over Trump's executive order temporarily blocking refugees. Even some Republicans were warning it could hinder anti-terrorism efforts. President Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary, in written responses to questions from senators, appears to have used several sentences and phrases from other sources without attribution - including from a top Obama administration civil rights official.

The responses from nominee Betsy... Not everything ground to a halt. The Senate education committee voted 12-11 to send Trump's pick to head the Education Department, Betsy DeVos, to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee quickly approved former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as Energy secretary by 16-7, and Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to head Interior by 16-6. And the full Senate easily confirmed Elaine Chao to become transportation secretary by a 93-6 vote. Chao was labor secretary under President George W. Bush, and is wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Just before the Finance committee was scheduled to vote on Price and Mnuchin, Democrats called a briefing for reporters and announced their plan to force a delay. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said Price and Mnuchin would hold positions "that directly affect peoples' lives every day. The truth matters." Alabama Sen.

He vowed at his confirmation hearing to stay independent from the... Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, accused Democrats of "a lack of desire to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities." "They ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots," he said. In 2013 when Democrats controlled the Senate, Republicans boycotted a committee vote on Gina McCarthy to head the Environmental Protection Agency, temporarily stalling it. Democrats cited one report in The Wall Street Journal that Price received a special, discounted offer to buy stock in a biomedical company, which contradicted his testimony to Congress. They said another report in The Columbus Dispatch showed documents revealing that Mnuchin had not been truthful with the Senate in the confirmation process in comments about how his bank OneWest had handled home foreclosures. Republicans have supported both men, and both have strongly defended their actions. Democrats have opposed Price, a seven-term congressional veteran, for his staunch backing of his party's drive to scuttle Obama's health care law and to reshape Medicare and Medicaid, which help older and low-income people afford medical care. Republican leaders made their hopes clear last month. Sitting at a long senate dais, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt held up four fingers, noting that Elaine Chao had made her way through the confirmation process multiple times over the decades "without a dissenting vote on the Senate floor." On Tuesday,... Republican leaders made their hopes clear last month. Sitting at a long senate dais, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt held up four fingers, noting that Elaine Chao had made her way through the confirmation process multiple times over the decades "without a dissenting vote on the Senate floor." On Tuesday,... They've also assailed Price for buying stocks of health care firms, accusing him of using insider information and conflicts of interest for backing legislation that could help his investments. Price says his trades were largely managed by brokers and that he's followed congressional ethics rules. Democrats have criticized Mnuchin for not initially revealing nearly $100 million in assets, and were expected to vote against both nominees. They've also accused him of failing to protect homeowners from foreclosures and criticized him for not initially disclosing all his assets. DeVos, a wealthy GOP donor and conservative activist, has long supported charter schools and allowing school choice. That's prompted opposition from Democrats and teachers' unions who view her stance as a threat to federal dollars that support public education. Critics have also mocked her for suggesting that guns could be justified in schools to protect students from grizzly bears. Two prominent Republicans on the education committee, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said they remained uncertain if they will vote for her on the Senate floor. Murkowski said DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America's struggling schools and its children. Associated Press

Several NAACP protesters led by their national president were escorted away in handcuffs by police after staging a sit-in Tuesday at the Alabama office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for U.S. attorney general, the civil rights group said. The organization held the demonstration to protest Sessions' nomination by President-elect Donald Trump, saying Sessions has a questionable record on civil rights and "can't be trusted to be the chief law enforcement officer for voting rights." "We have an attorney general nominee who does not acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while mouthing faith in the myth of voter fraud," Brooks said by phone earlier in Tuesday's protest. The sit-in at Sessions' office in Mobile, Alabama — the city the Republican senator calls home — began around after 11:a.m. Tuesday. Demonstrators refused a request by the building manager to leave when the building closed for the day at 6 p.m. Police could be seen on video footage coming and handcuffing at least five protesters and escorted them to a police van. "We all are aware of the laws of trespass. We are engaging in a voluntary act of civil disobedience," Brooks told the officers who arrived at the scene. The NAACP broadcast the events live on the organization's Facebook page. Patricia Mokolo, a spokeswoman for the Alabama chapter of the NAACP said the demonstrators including Brooks were arrested, but she did not know of a charge. A police spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.

A group of more than 1,100 law school professors from across the country is sending a letter to Congress Tuesday urging the Senate to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general. The letter, signed by law professors from 170 law schools in 48 states, is also scheduled... The all-day protest ended in handcuffs but without confrontation. Brooks shook the hands of the officers and the officers allowed the protesters to kneel and pray before they were led away. Brooks criticized Sessions' prosecution of African-American voting rights activists on voter fraud charges when he was a U.S. attorney in Alabama. The group also raised concerns about the future of the Voting Rights Act under Sessions and noted allegations — raised decades ago in Sessions unsuccessful 1986 confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship — that Sessions made racially insensitive remarks when he was a U.S. attorney. Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said in a statement that the nominee has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption. "Many African-American leaders who've known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next Attorney General. These false portrayals of Senator Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited," the statement added. In testimony at the 1986 confirmation hearing, Sessions was accused by some hearing witnesses of saying the NAACP was "un-American" and saying he thought Ku Klux Klan members were "OK until I found out they smoke pot," Sessions said during the hearing that the Klan remark was a joke and that other remarks were mischaracterized. What he had said, Sessions said, was that civil rights groups hurt themselves when "they take positions that people think are un-American they hurt themselves." He then praised the work of the NAACP. The demonstration marked the latest criticism of Trump's pick for attorney general. Sessions' confirmation hearings are expected to begin next week, highlighted by a vigorous push both by those favoring the nomination and those opposed to it. Former Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was part of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund team representing the black civil rights activists in the voter fraud prosecution, on Tuesday urged U.S. senators to reject Sessions' nomination.

A group of more than 1,100 law school professors from across the country is sending a letter to Congress Tuesday urging the Senate to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general. The letter, signed by law professors from 170 law schools in 48 states, is also scheduled to run as a full-page newspaper ad aimed at senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be holding confirmation hearings for Sessions on Jan. 10 and 11. "We are convinced that Jeff Sessions will not fairly enforce our nation's laws and promote justice and equality in the United States," says the letter, signed by prominent legal scholars including Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School and Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of California, Irvine School of Law. The professors from every state except North Dakota and Alaska, which has no law school, highlight the rejection of Sessions's nomination to a federal judgeship more than 20 years ago. Robin Walker Sterling of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, one of the organizers of the letter, said that 1,000 professors signed on within 72 hours. "Clearly, there are many, many law professors who are very uneasy with the prospect of Attorney General Sessions, and they are willing to take a public stand in opposition to his nomination," she said. The law professors wrote that some of them have concerns about Sessions's prosecution of three civil rights activists for voter fraud in Alabama in 1985, his support for building a wall along the nation's southern border and his "repeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and members of the LGBTQ community." Democratic senators plan to aggressively target eight of Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees in the coming weeks and are pushing to stretch their confirmation votes into March - an unprecedented break with Senate tradition.

Democratic senators plan to aggressively target eight of Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees in the coming weeks and are pushing to stretch their confirmation votes into March - an unprecedented break with Senate tradition. Such delays would upend Republican hopes of quickly holding hearings and confirming... "Nothing in Senator Sessions's public life since 1986," the letter says, "has convinced us that he is a different man than the 39-year-old attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge." William Smith, former chief counsel to Sessions, who is African American, has said that people who call Sessions racially insensitive are "just lying. And they should stop the smear campaign." "The people making these allegations against Sen. Sessions don't know him," Smith said in an interview. "In the last 30 years, they probably haven't spent 10 hours with him. I spent 10 years working with him . . . as his top legal adviser. There are not statements that he made that are inappropriate." Allegations of racial insensitivity were made against Sessions at a 1986 Senate hearing when he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be a federal judge. His nomination was defeated, after being opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, People for the American Way and the NAACP, which is now protesting his nomination for attorney general, calling it "despicable and unacceptable." Supporters of Sessions note that his nomination has been endorsed by Gerald Reynolds, the former chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. In a letter to the ranking members of the Judiciary Committee, Reynolds, who is African American, said, "Session is a man of great character and integrity with a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law." Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. Sarah Flores, spokeswoman for Sessions, said Friday in response to the NAACP statement that Sessions "has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption." "Many African-American leaders who've known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next Attorney General," Flores said. "These false portrayals of Senator Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited. From the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs Association to civil rights leaders and African-American elected officials, to victims' rights organizations, Senator Sessions has inspired confidence from people across the country that he will return the Department of Justice to an agency the American people can be proud of once again."

Key disclosure reports for four out of nine of Donald Trump's nominees subject to Senate confirmation hearings this week had yet to be made public by late Monday, underscoring concerns from the Office of Government Ethics that it is being rushed to approve the documentation. The first nomination hearing is slated for Tuesday, for attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, whose ethics report has been completed. But paperwork for some other nominees was not available. For example, the ethics report had yet to be made public for Betsy DeVos, the billionaire who is slated to head the Department of Education. Devos' confirmation hearing was originally set for Wednesday, but was postponed on Monday night to Jan. 17. Even if all the reports are released just before the hearings, some ethics specialists said the process is too hurried for the public and senators to evaluate the information. The reports focus on potential financial conflicts of interest and agreements to divest certain holdings. "The whole point of ventilating this stuff is to enable the American people and senators to ask questions of the nominee about how you are going to address conflicts," said Norman Eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer in the Obama administration. Eisen cited a letter written in February 2009 by then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that called on the Obama administration to promptly provide all ethics disclosure material "in time for review and prior to a committee hearing." On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., tried to use McConnell's letter against him, sending him a tweaked copy in which he crossed out McConnell's name as the signatory and swapped in his own. Antonia Ferrier, a spokesman for McConnell, said Monday that his 2009 letter had been written after most Obama nominees had been confirmed. She said Republicans are providing all the needed information for the Trump administration's nominees in a timely manner. By late Monday, the Office of Government Ethics had released reports for five top picks subject to hearings this week: Sessions, defense nominee James Mattis, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, CIA director nominee Mike Pompeo and transportation nominee Elaine Chao. This week is shaping up to be one of the most consequential of President-elect Donald Trump's transition, as senators prepare to consider as many as seven Cabinet nominees in committee. Republicans are under fire from Democrats and ethics officials for scheduling confirmation hearings before investigators... This week is shaping up to be one of the most consequential of President-elect Donald Trump's transition, as senators prepare to consider as many as seven Cabinet nominees in committee. Republicans are under fire from Democrats and ethics officials for scheduling confirmation hearings before investigators... The agency had not posted reports for the four others: DeVos, homeland security nominee John Kelly, commerce nominee Wilbur Ross, and housing and urban development nominee Ben Carson. A spokeswoman for the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said the panel had ethics paperwork for Kelly, but it had not been made public by the ethics office as of Monday night. Kelly's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. The documents show that Mattis, a retired Marine general, has received millions of dollars in income since leaving the military, including through lucrative speaking engagements with companies such as Goldman Sachs and Northrop Grumman, and paid positions with Theranos, Stanford University and General Dynamics. Mattis, who retired as chief of U.S. Central Command in 2013, said in a memo to the Pentagon dated Jan. 5 that he would not participate "personally and substantially" in any matters in which he knew he had a financial interest without seeking a legal waiver. Republicans are vowing to press ahead with confirmation hearings this week for Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees despite the concerns of a federal watchdog that their complex backgrounds are slowing required ethics reviews. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday that there are... Republicans are vowing to press ahead with confirmation hearings this week for Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees despite the concerns of a federal watchdog that their complex backgrounds are slowing required ethics reviews. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday that there are... Mattis' most significant forms of income since retiring, according to the documents, include a salary of $419,359 as a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and fees of $242,000 as a member of the board of directors at the defense contractor General Dynamics. Mattis also received $150,000 in fees as a member of the board of directors at Theranos, a controversial Silicon Valley blood-testing firm. He pushed for its technology to be incorporated while chief of U.S. Central Command, according to emails obtained and previously detailed by The Washington Post. But the effectiveness of the firm's technology was called into question, and Theranos has since fallen from grace and laid off dozens of employees. In addition to the ethics reports, the FBI conducts background checks of top nominees. The bureau has completed checks for five of the nine Trump nominees with confirmation hearings this week, according to Republican aides. Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, said in a Friday letter that it was "of great concern to me" that confirmation hearings were scheduled before all the reviews were complete. "It has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings." The agency declined to say whether Shaub's concerns had been allayed since Friday. Shaub did not respond to a request for comment. Since his surprise victory in November, Trump has been quick to name his nominees but slower to complete the background paperwork that the Senate requires for them to be confirmed. In 2008 and 2009, Obama's transition officials began vetting potential Cabinet nominees before the election, in an effort to move them through the process as quickly as possible and identify potential problems with their nominations before they became public. As a result, all of Obama's nominees had completed their background check, ethics and committee paperwork before their confirmation hearings. "We had developed a pretty detailed confirmation plan before Election Day," said Caroline Chambers, who served as the director of confirmations for Obama's transition team. "I suspect the Trump transition did not." "They did get a late start, and they probably didn't have as much institutional support in the beginning," she added. Obama's precedent was followed by Hillary Clinton's transition team, which began requesting FBI background checks for potential nominees in the months leading up to the election. It is not clear when Trump began vetting his Cabinet nominees, and transition officials did not comment on their vetting process. Trump's approach is not unprecedented. In 2001, at least a handful of George W. Bush's Cabinet appointees entered their congressional confirmation hearings without having certified ethics agreements with the Office of Government Ethics. One of those nominees was Bush's pick for commerce secretary, Donald Evans, who went though a confirmation hearing on Jan. 4, 2001, but did not submit a completed ethics form until Jan. 19, 2001, a day before the Senate confirmed his appointment. But the approach could lead to headaches for Trump's team. Democratic groups have already created war rooms to unearth damaging or embarrassing information about Trump's nominees. "Our sense is that the vetting was light and incomplete," said David Brock, who runs a number of Democratic groups that plan to go on the offense against Trump's nominees. "There's a potential vulnerability here on the ground. They didn't follow precedent and really do the kind of vetting that is normally done. There's room for error." Some Democrats have called for more of the top Trump nominees to supply their tax returns. But Republicans said that, in the end, the Trump administration will send just as much information about its nominees as prior administrations have. There is no law requiring that Cabinet nominees submit their tax returns, but by Senate tradition, they have been requested for a few positions such as treasury secretary, who oversees the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats are pushing for more disclosure from Trump nominees, like DeVos, who have complex and large financial assets. Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, said it is "ridiculous" for Democrats to demand new information not required of past nominees. "These are long-standing practices by these committees that they had no problem upholding twice though President Obama's nomination process," Spicer said. "It is 100 percent politics, and that's it. "Everything that they've additionally asked for is not only out of practice, but it is blatantly political," he said. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation" that Trump and more of his nominees should release their tax returns. Trump said during the campaign that he would release his returns when an IRS audit was complete. But McConnell said on the same program that Democrats are being sore losers. "We are still in the process of getting the papers in," McConnell said. "I think at least five of the nominees have all of their papers in. You know, what this is about . . . the Democrats are really frustrated that they lost the election. I was in [that] position eight years ago. I know how it feels when you are coming into a new situation that the other guys won the election." On Monday, McConnell emerged from a meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York and expressed hope that the nominees would be speedily confirmed. He told reporters that "everybody will be properly vetted, as they have been in the past, and I'm hopeful that we'll get up to six or seven - particularly national security team in place - on Day One." --- The Washington Post's Dan Lamothe and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.

Barraged by questions about Russia, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state promised a far more muscular approach toward the Kremlin on Wednesday, abandoning much of the president-elect's emphasis on improving ties between the Cold War foes. Instead, Rex Tillerson suggested the outgoing Obama administration responded too softly to Moscow's takeover of Ukrainian territory. The surprising shift in tone by Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil CEO and Russian "Order of Friendship" recipient, reflected the difficulty Trump will have in persuading Democrats and Republicans to broach a broad rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin's government. Calling Russia a "danger" to the United States, Tillerson said he would keep U.S. sanctions in place and consider new penalties related to Russian meddling in the presidential election. Although he said he hadn't read last week's classified assessment by the U.S. intelligence community, Tillerson said it was a "fair assumption" that Putin would have ordered the operation that purportedly included hacking, propaganda and internet trolls to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy and advance Trump's. But in a puzzling revelation, Tillerson conceded he hadn't yet talked with Trump about a Russia policy. "Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests," Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He added that Trump's administration would be committed to the defense of America's NATO partners, an obligation the president-elect called into question during the campaign if allies failed to meet defense spending pledges. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. While his prepared statement reflected some of Trump's desire for improved ties, Tillerson quickly pivoted under pressure from both sides of the aisle. On Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea region, he said, "That was a taking of territory that was not theirs." Still, he criticized President Barack Obama's sanctions on Russia, which ended up costing Exxon hundreds of millions of dollars. And he declared that he would have responded by urging Ukraine to send all available military units to its eastern border with Russia and recommending U.S. and allied support through defensive weapons and air surveillance, to send a message to Moscow. "That is the type of response that Russia expects," he said in a response to questions from Sen. Marco Rubio, Tillerson's toughest GOP inquisitor, who later lectured the oil man on human rights and hinted he might withhold his support. "If Russia acts with force," Tillerson said, "they require a proportional show of force." Trump offered a sharply different account of Ukraine during the presidential campaign and never proposed a show of U.S. military force in Ukraine. In an August interview, he claimed Russia would not enter Ukraine, not seeming to know Russian troops were already there. He suggested Crimea didn't count because the peninsula's people preferred being part of Russia, restating Putin's reason for taking the territory in 2014. Like Trump, Tillerson vowed complete support for Israel, which he called America's "most important ally" in the Middle East. A brief look at Republican Sen.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the bridge between Trump and the intelligence community. He said the new administration would undertake a full review of the Iran nuclear deal to deny the Islamic republic the ability to acquire an atomic weapon. He said that might only be possible if Iran can no longer enrich uranium, which the accord permits under strict constraints and without which Tehran wouldn't have made the deal. Some of the questioning reflected the traditional friction between a Congress that wants to prescribe foreign policy and an executive branch that traditionally seeks to maintain broad flexibility in its international affairs, tinted by Tillerson's vocal opposition to economic sanctions as a business leader. Addressing some of Congress' most experienced architects of U.S. economic pressure, Tillerson called sanctions "a powerful tool" in deterrence that could, however, also project weakness if applied poorly. He said neither he nor Exxon had lobbied against sanctions. But the company did try to influence sanctions legislation on Russia two years ago, congressional records and data from the Center for Responsive Politics show, and Tillerson made numerous White House visits, to no avail. Given a second chance on the subject, Tillerson sought to clarify his answer by saying he had expressed concerns related to security in shutting down an Exxon operation newly prohibited under the sanctions. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, goes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017. Tillerson represents a break in a longstanding tradition of secretaries of state with extensive military, legislative, political or diplomatic experience. Yet his supporters point to Tillerson's lengthy career as a senior executive in a mammoth multinational company as proof he has the management and negotiating skills to succeed in the State Department's top post, particularly when facing tough foreign governments. "It's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying," Trump said of Tillerson during a news conference in New York that occurred as Tillerson was testifying. "He ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it." His Exxon experience, however, has been criticized by Democrats for possible conflicts of interest because of the company's far-flung business dealings. Tillerson, who stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016, said he understood being secretary of state meant different responsibilities. He pledged to be a steward for U.S. national interests rather than corporate ones. "He is not prepared to be our secretary of state," said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. If all 10 Democrats on the committee vote against Tillerson, and Rubio or any other Republican joins them, the nomination would then be referred to the full Senate with "no recommendation." That would be an embarrassment for such a high-profile Cabinet nominee and could signal a larger confirmation battle. "He's got to convince me he sees Russia for who they are," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, another skeptical Republican. On Tillerson's proposed response to the election hacking charges, Graham said, "Real fuzzy answer." Associated Press

Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday that top intelligence leaders told him and President Barack Obama they felt obligated to inform them about uncorroborated allegations about President-elect Donald Trump out of concern the information would become public and catch them off-guard. In an interview, Biden said neither he nor Obama asked U.S. intelligence agencies to try to corroborate the unverified claims that Russia had obtained compromising sexual and financial allegations about Trump. "I think it's something that obviously the agency thinks they have to track down," Biden said. He added later, "It surprised me in that it made it to the point where the agency, the FBI thought they had to pursue it." In the hourlong session with The Associated Press and other news outlets, the vice president was sharply critical of Trump for publicly disparaging intelligence officials, saying Trump was damaging U.S. standing and playing into Russia's hands. He also took umbrage at Trump's comments accusing intelligence agencies of allowing the information to leak publicly and drawing a comparison to "living in Nazi Germany." "The one thing you never want to invoke is Nazi Germany, no matter what the circumstances," Biden said. "It's an overwhelming diversion from the point you're trying to make." Biden said that in the briefing he and Obama received from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others, there were "no conclusions drawn" from the uncorroborated dossier, which was produced in August and then released publicly this week by the media. Biden said it was "totally ancillary" to the purpose of the meeting, which was to brief Obama on a report he ordered documenting Russian interference in the U.S. campaign. It was a bombshell story, emerging on the eve of Donald Trump's first news conference as president-elect: U.S. intelligence officials had presented Trump with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him.

It was a bombshell story, emerging on the eve of Donald Trump's first news conference as president-elect: U.S. intelligence officials had presented Trump with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him. The purported Russian efforts... "As a matter of fact, the president was like, 'What does this have anything to do with anything?'" Biden said. He said intelligence leaders responded by saying "Well, we feel obliged to tell you, Mr. President, because you may hear about it. We're going to tell him," referring to Trump. Biden said intelligence leaders told him and Obama that they couldn't say whether or not the allegations were true or untrue. He said there was "hardly any discussion" about the allegations in the briefing. "Neither the president nor I asked for any detail," Biden said. But he added of the dossier: "I've read everything." Trump has vehemently denied the allegations included in a dossier about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians. The dossier also included unsubstantiated claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump, attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated the claims. Trump has denied them. A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... The FBI has been working to corroborate the details in the dossier, although it's unclear how long that investigation has been running or how many resources are assigned. FBI Director James Comey has declined even to acknowledge the investigation publicly in line with FBI protocol. The dossier was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative and had been circulating among news organizations and intelligence agencies in Washington for months. Its existence became known publicly following reports the intelligence community had briefed Trump on the dossier. In the interview, Biden criticized Trump's rocky relationship with intelligence officials. The president-elect has publicly challenged their assessment about Russia's role in the election and suggested they have skewed evidence. Trump has received the President's Daily Brief, the highest-level intelligence document produced in the United States, a few times but has insisted he doesn't need it daily and suggested he knows more than intelligence leaders. Biden said it would be a "genuine tragedy" if Trump refused the daily intelligence briefing presidents traditionally receive. To illustrate his point, Biden took out the black tablet computer he uses to read his daily briefing and showed it to reporters as he sat next to a crackling fireplace in his office, just steps from the Oval Office. He said it is password-protected and includes a feature he uses to ask questions about the intelligence that are responded to the same day. Biden said at least five foreign leaders have already contacted him expressing concern over Trump's second-guessing of U.S. intelligence agencies. "It is really very damaging in my view to our standing in the world for a president to take one of the crown jewels of our national defense and denigrate it," Biden said. "It plays into, particularly now, the Russian narrative that America doesn't know what it's doing." After nearly half a century in public office, Biden will exit the national stage next Friday, although he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he's developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania. He also plans to continue with the cancer "moonshot" effort he launched after his son died. Biden was full of praise for his successor, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. He said he's been sending Pence memos with his advice on how to handle certain relationships, such as with Iraqi and Ukrainian leaders, and on "the things that could explode most easily." He said Pence had been receptive to his advice but had less time these days to speak to Biden due to the heavy role he's playing in setting up Trump's administration. Biden said he's made his national security adviser, Colin Kahl, available to Pence but hoped Pence would quickly name a national security adviser of his own. "It would be better if they had been in a better position where he actually had somebody that Colin could sit down with every morning," Biden said. Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here's a guide to 15 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. - "It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis." Trump is exaggerating. During the primaries, he was a near-constant presence on television because he frequently called into interview shows. But he generally only held news conferences after primary contests were held. He last held a news conference on July 27. - "You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant." Trump claims credit for these announcements, but that's wrong. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said the plan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump; he credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers. In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... With regards to Ford, analysts say Ford's decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico has more to do with the company's long-term goal - particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles - than the administration. It's easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico. - "When we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China." Actually, the Chinese hack of 22 million accounts at the Office of Personnel Management was front page news. The Russian hacking of the presidential election and the OPM hack are not directly comparable. The Russian campaign, as described by U.S. intelligence, involved more than just hacking, with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process. The Chinese hack had a more isolated goal - espionage. China appears to have wanted the material in order to engage in possible blackmail. Obama administration officials say the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying - something the United States does as well. U.S. officials also say that China responded to U.S. pressure after the hack was discovered, and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced. China may have been receptive to U.S. pressure at the time because President Xi Jinping was about to visit the United States, and he did not want the hack to mar the visit. - "The Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job….And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through." This is an example of attacking one of the victims, the Democratic National Committee. But FBI Director James Comey says there is evidence that older Republican National Committee domains were also targeted but none of the information that may have been obtained was leaked. Comey said that the Russians "got far deeper and wider into the [DNC] than the RNC," adding that "similar techniques were used in both cases." But Trump's remarks also ignore the broader implications of the unclassified intelligence report released on Jan. 5 - how the Russian government used Internet trolls and RT (Russia's state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and U.S. democracy. The Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015, well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Meanwhile, "RT's coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism," the report said. (It does not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign.) - "Look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing." Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton getting a debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich. to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint. The political class is still coming to grips with what appears to be Donald Trump’s novel management philosophy: Government by Twitter. Put aside the by-now-familiar weirdness of our president-elect’s gloating over Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor “Celebrity Apprentice” ratings or swipes at Meryl Streep.... The political class is still coming to grips with what appears to be Donald Trump’s novel management philosophy: Government by Twitter. Put aside the by-now-familiar weirdness of our president-elect’s gloating over Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor “Celebrity Apprentice” ratings or swipes at Meryl Streep.... There's no indication Clinton was told this information but in any case it's a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. In her answer, Clinton committed to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Lee-Anne Waters, who asked the question, later said Clinton's answer "made me vomit in my mouth" because that was too long to wait in Flint. - "This administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed." Trump greatly simplifies a complex situation. The Islamic State terror group arose in response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it began to fade after the Bush administration surge in 2008. The civil war in Syria breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization. The conflict in Syria created a perfect vacuum in terms of governance, and so the civil war became an opportunity for the restoration of the organization. ISIS then saw opportunity to rebound in Iraq. One factor was the withdrawal of U.S. troops order by President Obama. But there was also rampant mismanagement by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded the Iraqi military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. - "I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia." Trump is being misleading when he says he has stayed away from Russia. Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled. A man accused of interrupting a Chicago performance of the musical "Hamilton" with an obscenity-streaked outburst over his support of President-elect Donald Trump pleaded guilty Monday to charges of misdemeanor trespassing stemming from the incident, according to court records and the man's attorney. A man accused of interrupting a Chicago performance of the musical "Hamilton" with an obscenity-streaked outburst over his support of President-elect Donald Trump pleaded guilty Monday to charges of misdemeanor trespassing stemming from the incident, according to court records and the man's attorney. In a 2008 speech, Trump's son, Donald Jr., made it clear that the Trumps want to do business in Russia, but were finding it difficult. "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets," Trump's son told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia." Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post in May: "I have no doubt, as a company, I know we've looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian Republics." - "I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president." There's a lot of carrot-and-stick talk these days about how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign to hack into a bulwark of U.S. democracy, a presidential election. Donald Trump makes it clear he prefers dangling carrots. Setting aside the stick, though, would be a serious... There's a lot of carrot-and-stick talk these days about how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign to hack into a bulwark of U.S. democracy, a presidential election. Donald Trump makes it clear he prefers dangling carrots. Setting aside the stick, though, would be a serious... This is basically correct. The law doesn't say the president can't have a conflict of interest. But Congress, under Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code, did exempt the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest laws on the theory that the presidency has so much power that any possible executive action might pose a potential conflict. - "The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters….You learn very little to a tax return." Trump is wrong on both counts. A Pew Research Center poll conducted Jan. 4-9 found that 60 percent of Americans believed Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Meanwhile, tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person's finances in several key areas. First, the tax return reveals a person's annual income. A person's net worth is not disclosed, but voters would gain an understanding of a person's cash flow. Second, voters would understand the sources of a person's income, such as how much comes from certain businesses, speeches, dividends, capital gains and so forth. Third, a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity. Mitt Romney gave almost $2.3 million to charity in 2011, while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave $3 million to charity in 2014. We know these figures because of information in their tax returns. Trump claims he has given $102 million to charity in the past five years, but a Washington Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash - mostly just free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles. Trump's tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity - indeed, whether he has given anything at all. Try though they might, Republicans won't be able to erase President Barack Obama's legacy expansion of health care when they take control of the White House along with both houses of Congress. Oh, sure, it's possible that GOP lawmakers and incoming President Donald Trump will follow through on... Try though they might, Republicans won't be able to erase President Barack Obama's legacy expansion of health care when they take control of the White House along with both houses of Congress. Oh, sure, it's possible that GOP lawmakers and incoming President Donald Trump will follow through on... Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes. Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump's income actually goes to taxes. - "We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody." A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trump's comment that there "billions of dollars of losses" in trade reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese or Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would "gain" money that had been lost. - "Some states have over a hundred percent [premium] increase." Trump exaggerates here, and appears to misunderstand a fundamental part of the Affordable Care Act. State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies. The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, "anecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face." - "I want to thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs." Trump keeps counting jobs that were never going to go to Mexico in the first place. Union officials say the number of jobs saved at Carrier shrank to 730, once the official paperwork was submitted. Meanwhile, 553 jobs, focused on making fan coils, will go to Mexico, as well as 700 jobs from a United Technologies Electronics Controls (UTEC) facility. Another 400 jobs in the two facilities, mostly administrative, were never going to leave. In effect, Trump saved 37 percent of the jobs slated to depart. But Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told CNN that even more jobs at Carrier eventually would be lost through automation. - "96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number -- that's the real number." This is an absurd claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of December 2016, 95.1 million Americans 16 years and older were "not in labor force." How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 253.9 million people, and 159.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.1 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent because just 7.5 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. Trump is doing a real disservice by claiming 96 million really want a job that "they can't get." - "I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public." We cannot resist noting that Trump was the leading purveyor of false "birther" claims questions, based on no evidence, that President Obama was not born in the United States. He frequently claimed that Obama had spent $2 million to cover this up - a number he plucked out of World Net Daily, which promotes conservative-leaning conspiracy theories.

President-elect Donald Trump, under fire for his business conflicts, said Wednesday that he will turn his company over to his sons — but he won’t sell his network of properties and deals. Trump will create a trust and turn it over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric along with another business executive, Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon said during an often-raucous New York news conference. Trump will have no role in running the Trump Organization, which will avoid any new foreign deals while Trump is in office, she said.  New U.S. deals will be permitted, with written approval from a new ethics advisor who will work for the company. With more than 500 corporations, huge debts and real-estate projects all over the world, Trump’s business represents unprecedented potential conflicts with his duties as president. Ethics experts have insisted that Trump should sell all his holdings and place the proceeds in a blind trust. Handing over control to his sons would not meet the standards of a blind trust, according to the Office of Government Ethics. The arrangement “falls far short of what’s necessary to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Paul Ryan, a lawyer with the watchdog group Common Cause. “The American public must now demand complete transparency of the Trump Organization and President-elect Trump’s finances,” he said. But Trump again dismissed suggestions that the American public cared about potential business conflicts, and said he had no plans to release his tax returns, which would provide some transparency about his dealings. “The only ones who care about the tax returns are the reporters,” Trump said. “I won. No, I don’t think they care at all.” Dillon said it would be impractical for the Trump Organization to sell off properties like Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago resort or to unload the dozens of deals in which Trump gets paid a licensing fee for his name. President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. That would “greatly diminish the value of assets and create a fire sale,” she said. “President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.” She also said that selling the assets would exacerbate conflicts, not cure them. The sons would have to take on huge debts, raising questions about the terms of the loans and whether the lenders were trying to curry favor with Trump. She said Trump will resign from all positions with his corporations and not get any information about how individual properties are doing — just a general profit and loss statement.

President-elect Donald Trump pushed Congress Tuesday to act swiftly to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, and follow up quickly with a replacement. House Speaker Paul Ryan, after talking with Trump, announced that the House would aim to take both steps "concurrently." The push for speed and coordination came as growing numbers of Republicans expressed concerns about GOP leadership's plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in hand, even though the party has had more than six years to come up with one. Trump made his comments in an interview with The New York Times. Republicans will work on unraveling and replacing the health care law at the same time, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday as GOP leaders struggled to align their zeal to rapidly erase one of President Barack Obama's proudest achievements with Congress' legislative and political pitfalls. Ryan,... Republicans will work on unraveling and replacing the health care law at the same time, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday as GOP leaders struggled to align their zeal to rapidly erase one of President Barack Obama's proudest achievements with Congress' legislative and political pitfalls. Ryan,... "We have to get to business. Obamacare has been a catastrophic event," Trump said. Under the congressional timetable, procedural budget votes set for later this week in the House and Senate will put the repeal process in motion. But the vote on repealing Obamacare isn't expected until mid-February at earliest; a full replacement hadn't been expected until months or even years later. Trump seemed confused about that schedule, telling the Times that the repeal should be "probably sometime next week," and "the replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter." Despite his imprecision, Trump was clear that he put an imperative on speed for both repealing and replacing the law. That contradicts the approach sketched out by GOP leaders who've described a transition period of months or years between repealing the law and replacing it with something else. But even before Trump's comments Tuesday, the notion of a lengthy transition period was running into problems on Capitol Hill from Republicans anxious about waiting too long between repealing the bill and replacing it. Ryan addressed reporters Tuesday morning and described a new goal. "It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently," Ryan said. "We're going to use every tool at our disposal, through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal, so that we can save people from this mess." Energized by Republican moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act, leading patient advocates, consumer groups, labor unions and Democratic officials are mobilizing a nationwide campaign to defend the law and protect millions of Americans who depend on the law and other government health programs. Energized by Republican moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act, leading patient advocates, consumer groups, labor unions and Democratic officials are mobilizing a nationwide campaign to defend the law and protect millions of Americans who depend on the law and other government health programs. That may be easier said than done. Under arcane budget rules in the Senate, Republicans will likely be able to use their slim majority to push through repeal legislation without Democratic votes. But they would need Democrats' help to write a replacement bill. Ryan indicated Tuesday Republicans would try to get around that obstacle by passing some elements of the replacement bill using fast-track Senate rules, too. Ryan announced the new plan to lawmakers Tuesday morning before discussing it with reporters. "He said we're going to be doing it concurrently with the repeal. He said he had a conversation yesterday with Donald Trump, and they're on the same page," said Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida. GOP lawmakers, particularly House members who face voters every two years, are eager to repeal and replace the mammoth health law before the 2018 midterm elections, and some are frustrated that having finally grabbed the reins of power in Washington, the party is unprepared to act. "We've been at it now for six years and it's time for us to produce a replacement plan and hopefully we'll do that in the very near term," said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who's among a group of Republicans pushing for a delay in the repeal bill to allow time to write a replacement. Associated Press

A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations, but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Trump, however, replied Tuesday night with a Tweet declaring: “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” A senior U.S. official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia appeared to have collected embarrassing information on both major candidates, but only released material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton - a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered U.S. spy agencies' conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump win. The inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report, a development first reported Tuesday by CNN, adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russia's efforts to undermine American democracy. And it adds another bizarre twist to an already strange election year, injecting new controversy over the Trump team's relations with Russia just when the president-elect is trying to consolidate and launch his new administration. If true, the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information - known in espionage circles by the Russian term "kompromat" - that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House. The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report, an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trump's inner circle and representatives of Moscow. Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday dismissed as an "absolute fantasy" allegations that the Kremlin has collected compromising information about Trump. "The Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump, such information isn't consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy," Dmitry Peskov, who handles Putin's day-to-day communications, told journalists. U.S. officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information obtained through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official. The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in October. U.S. officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims, U.S. officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm, considered them credible, and determined that it was plausible that they would have first-hand knowledge of Russia's alleged dossier on Trump. The CIA, the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matter. After CNN's report Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general, was asked at his confirmation hearing about the allegations in the intelligence report. "If it's true, it's obviously extremely serious," Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said after reading from the CNN report. "And if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will do you?" Sessions responded that he was "not aware of any of those activities." While saying he had not spoken to Trump about the reports, he said "allegations get made about candidates all the time, and they've been made about President-elect Trump a lot." Dossiers compiled by the former British intelligence official have been circulating in Washington for months. Several news organizations, including the Washington Post, have been attempting to confirm many of the specific allegations without success. One U.S. official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations because they were already circulating widely and it was "mostly a courtesy" to let him know they were out there. Compiled initially in mid-2016 and supplemented during and after the campaign, the reports include detailed allegations that the Russians hold compromising material about Trump, some of it obtained while Trump visited Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant and on a previous visit to Russia. Other reports compiled by the former intelligence official allege contacts between Trump personnel and business officials and Russian officials during the campaign. The former intelligence official was at one point paid to explore Trump's ties to Russia by anti-Trump Republicans and later by supporters of the Democratic party. "If I was the Clinton campaign, I would be reaching out to these people who put together the dossier, and I'd ask for my money back," Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen told the Washington Post last week. "It's wrong. There's no accuracy. There's not an ounce of validity to anything that exists in that file." Last month, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had been provided with the information, personally delivered it to FBI Director James Comey. A source familiar with the matter said the FBI had it well before then and had interviewed the former intelligence official. Hillary Clinton's former campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, appealed for a congressional inquiry. "Mitch McConnell, you must let a Select Committee investigate these allegations, as @SenJohnMcCain has been urging for weeks," Fallon wrote on Twitter. K.T. McFarland, Trump's designated national security adviser, declined to respond to a question about the report. "I don't know about the story that you're talking about that's broken," she said during participation in a panel Tuesday at the United States Institute of Peace. "I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing, but I'm going to refrain." "I'm not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had. I think I'd just say what [Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Jr.] said, which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome." Clapper, however, testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election result. The two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three separate versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week, including an abbreviated declassifed draft that was made public. It was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI, CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report, or whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts' conclusions. Senior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report on declined to comment. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said that "we can't comment on what goes on in" classified briefings, but added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on U.S. leaders "should not be a surprise to anyone." "The Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician," Nunes said. "That wouldn't be news." Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia, Nunes said, "No. I found that hard to believe. I have not heard that. News to me."

Donald Trump on Wednesday morning angrily denounced news reports about potentially compromising information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has collected any such intelligence. The president-elect also charged via Twitter that his "crooked opponents" are trying to undermine his electoral victory. He accused the intelligence community of leaking the information to get in "one last shot at me," tweeting, "Are we living in Nazi Germany?" Trump's comments follow the revelation Tuesday night that a classified report delivered to Trump and President Barack Obama last week, according to U.S. officials, included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising information about Trump's personal life and finances. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations but believed the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign.

A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... Trump on Wednesday will hold his first news conference since July. He is certain to face questions about his relationship with Russia and the intelligence community's conclusion that the Kremlin attempted to sway the outcome of the election in his favor, primarily through disseminating information obtained from the hack of Democratic email systems. Trump has cast doubt on the veracity of this conclusion, and he and his aides have aggressively pushed back against the idea that it had any effect on the election, calling the story a "witch hunt" being carried out by his political enemies. Earlier Wednesday, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the allegations that Russia has collected compromising information about Trump an "absolute fantasy." Soon after, Trump tweeted: "Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is 'A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.' Very unfair!"

Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. Most media organizations reported only on the existence of the report and that intelligence officials had included a summary of it in their briefings with Trump and Obama on Russia's attempts to sway the election. But BuzzFeed News published a document supposedly created by a former British intelligence official. The information it contains has not been verified. Trump and other officials appeared to focus on BuzzFeed's publication of the report, denying that the document possesses any truth. Trump said Wednesday morning that he had no relationship with Russia that could compromise him. "Russia has never tried to use leverage over me," he tweeted. "I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!" He again emphasized his belief that his political opponents are trying to undermine his presidency. "I win an election easily, a great 'movement' is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!" he said. "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" Speaking on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Wednesday, Trump adviser Reince Priebus called the BuzzFeed report "phony baloney garbage." He denied that Trump had engaged in compromising behavior in Russia and that Trump aide Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian officials. Both allegations were contained in the document published by BuzzFeed. "There was no craziness in Russia. There was no meeting in Prague," Priebus said. "It is not an intelligence document. Cohen has never been in Prague. And all of this stuff isn't even fit to print in the New York Times." The Washington Post's Greg Miller, Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.

FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday refused to say whether his bureau was investigating any possible ties between Russia and the Donald Trump's presidential campaign, citing policy not to comment on what the FBI might or might not be doing. Comey testified at the Senate's second hearing in a week addressing allegations of Russian election hacking. In late October he angered Democrats when he announced 11 days before the election that the FBI was looking at more emails as part of its investigation of Hillary Clinton. "I would never comment on investigations — whether we have one or not — in an open forum like this so I can't answer one way or another," Comey told the Senate's intelligence committee during his first public appearance before Congress since the unusual disclosure about Clinton. "The irony of your making that statement, I cannot avoid," said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent. Insisted Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., "The American people have the right to know this." It wasn't clear if Wyden was alluding to an investigation that may be classified, or if his questioning was an effort to cast Trump in a negative light shortly before the inauguration. Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., wrote two letters to the FBI last year before the election, asking the bureau to publicly disclose what it knew about Trump's aides' ties to Russia. A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said.

A classified report delivered to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump's personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said... An active FBI investigation of the next president for ties between his campaign and a nation accused of meddling in the presidential election could further stoke mistrust in the legitimacy of the democratic process. It could also put Trump's own FBI in the awkward position of examining the conduct of those closest to the commander-in-chief. The FBI was among three U.S. intelligence agencies that collaborated on last week's report on Russia's election activity. It tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to the hacking of email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats like Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It said there was no evidence the Russians tampered with vote tallies; the agencies said they couldn't assess if Russia succeeded in influencing Americans to vote for Trump. Intelligence officials briefed Trump and President Barack Obama on their findings late last week. The New York Times and CNN reported Tuesday night that the officials also presented Trump with unsubstantiated reports that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him. Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the U.S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who opposed Trump in the GOP primary, said Russia's activity wasn't guided by its support for Trump, but rather "to influence and to potentially manipulate American public opinion for the purpose of discrediting individual political figures, sowing chaos and division in our politics, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of our elections." Democrats at the committee hearing focused their toughest questions on Comey, who was widely criticized for breaking FBI policy in his decision to notify Congress about additional information that came up related to Clinton. He is in the fourth year of a 10-year term, meaning he is expected to stay on in the Trump administration. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Comey set a new standard by discussing the bureau's activity related to Clinton's private email server. That standard, she said, is the FBI discusses ongoing investigations when there is a "unique public interest in the transparency of that issue." The intelligence agencies' findings on Russian hacking fit that standard, she argued. "I'm not sure I can think of an issue of more serious public interest than this one," Harris said. "This committee needs to understand what the FBI does and does not know about campaign communications with Russia." Sitting beside Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, "Fair point." Associated Press

Acting attorney general Sally Quillian Yates, a longtime prosecutor from Atlanta, began her tenure as an Obama appointee two years ago by saying that pursuing justice was more important to her than bringing federal cases in court. "We're not the Department of Prosecutions or even the Department of Public Safety," Yates said in May 2015, the week after she was confirmed as deputy attorney general, the second-highest-ranking position in the Justice Department. "We are the Department of Justice." On Monday night, only days away from stepping down from her 27-year career in the Justice Department, Yates defied President Trump, ordering federal attorneys not to defend the controversial immigration order issued Friday. Within hours, Trump fired her. In a news release, the White House said Yates had "betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States." Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who told The Washington Post he would enforce the president's directive until Trump nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is confirmed. Yates, 56, struggled with her decision over the weekend, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. By Monday, though, she had concluded that she could not ask her federal attorneys to defend the order. Yates could not be reached for comment. She sent a memo to the civil division of the Justice Department and U.S. attorneys across the country saying she was not "convinced" the order was lawful, and that the department "will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so." Hours later, at about 9:15 p.m., Yates received a hand-delivered letter from the White House that the president was removing her from office. "She did what she believes was the right thing to do and then she gets fired for it," the official said. "This is not how she would have preferred to end her 27-year career. But she did what she had to do." Those who know Yates well said that her action was consistent with the independence and commitment to the rule of law they say she has exhibited throughout her career. "For nearly three decades, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has served Presidents of both parties, defending the Constitution and holding terrorists and other criminals accountable," said former labor secretary Tom Perez, who was head of the civil rights division in the Obama administration. "Acting Attorney General Yates's record is simply beyond reproach," said Perez, who is running to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court.The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career... But Trump's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, blasted Yates on Fox News after the acting attorney general was fired. "It can't be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the president's order," said Miller, who accused Yates of "refusing to defend the lawful power of the president." He added that he had no doubt about the legality of the order. For the past two years, Yates has been responsible for the day-to-day running of the 113,000-employee Justice Department. She was also been responsible for overseeing the Justice Department's work on the prior White House's clemency initiative, in which the president granted commutations to thousands of nonviolent drug offenders who met certain criteria set out by the administration. She also wrote a new policy two years ago that became known as "the Yates memo," which made the prosecution of individual executives - not just the corporations that employ them - a top priority for federal prosecutors. Last month, Yates was one of the Justice officials who announced that federal prosecutors indicted six executives at Volkswagen in connection with the company's diesel emissions scandal; the company agreed to pay $4.3 billion in criminal and civil penalties. Former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said that Yates was known in the department for voicing her opinions when she thought the administration was going in the wrong direction. Pierce said Yates was particularly vocal during a debate over government access to encrypted communications during criminal investigations, when some officials wanted to make it harder for law enforcement to access the locked information. "She advocated very strongly as a one-woman show for law enforcement and made the Obama administration pause on policies she thought would be harmful," Pierce said.

Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Donald Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing public outcry over Trump's executive order temporarily banning migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from across the globe, Democrats on Capitol Hill launched what they said would be a protracted fight on several fronts. It will include public protests against the ban, delaying Cabinet confirmations and an attempt to reject Trump's pick to serve on the Supreme Court, an announcement expected Tuesday. The plans represent a sharp pivot in Democratic strategy after weeks of vowing to work with Trump and Republicans in areas of agreement - and to allow noncontroversial nominees to be quickly confirmed. But "then Trump shredded the Constitution," said one senior aide familiar with ongoing strategy talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We should be using our time on the floor to talk about the dangerous consequences to U.S. national security by this executive order, we shouldn't be rushing through any confirmation votes this week," said Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. "We can take a pause in confirmation votes to try to get this executive order right. You know this is going to get Americans killed if we don't take our time to understand what this order is and what it's consequences are," he added. Trump's ban also significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill complaining angrily Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued. Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for... Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for... At least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump's order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban does not amount to a "religious test." And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored written statements expressing concerns about the order. But others spoke out more forcefully. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Monday that he was not briefed before the order was signed. "I know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill - not in our office," said Corker. The disarray over Trump's fulfillment of a core campaign promise underscored the increasingly strained relationship between the new White House and the Republican congressional majority. It comes after a rocky first week and a half punctuated by confusion over health care and tax reform, as well as frustration with the president obsessing over crowd size and his loss of the popular vote in November. Asked if he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., the number two Republican in the Senate said simply: "I wasn't." Pressed on when he first learned about the order, Corker answered that it was Friday, after it was signed. "I guess one of you guys probably told me about it - thank you for that," Corker told reporters. Politico reported Monday night that senior House Judiciary Committee staffers helped Trump's team draft the executive order without informing party leadership. A committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in a statement following the report: "Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law. However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll out and implementation." On Monday evening, Senate Democrats sought to quickly pass legislation that would rescind Trump's ban, but there was insufficient GOP support. Confirmation delays began as well, when Democrats blocked a committee from meeting to approve Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, to the full Senate. The Senate Finance Committee is now expected to consider the former Goldman Sachs banker on Tuesday, at the same time it will vote to approve the nomination of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Amid the Democratic outcry, Trump and his aides strongly defended the ban and faulted Democrats for trying to "obstruct" his Cabinet nominees. "We actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security," Trump said at a White House event. During a meeting with small business leaders, he blasted Democrats for delaying the confirmation of his nominees "for political reasons. Just politics." But it remained unclear just how united Democrats would remain. On Monday, the Senate voted on a key procedural step toward the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with three members of the Democratic caucus supporting him - Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D, Angus King, I-Maine, Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she didn't think there would be further delays of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general; and it was unclear whether Democrats would succeed in delaying a hearing Tuesday for Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services. Committees are also scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to serve as interior secretary; and GOP powerbroker Betsy DeVos to serve as education secretary. How far Democrats go will be closely watched by the liberal activists who joined them to protest Trump's ban Monday night on the steps of the Supreme Court. After the sun set, and Democrats made their way from the Capitol, chants of "hands too small, can't build a wall" and "build a fence around Mike Pence" alternated with "walk the walk!" - a command to the Democrats themselves. And when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the crowd, "What the president did is not constitutional," one protester retorted: "You're not doing anything if you don't stop Sessions!" Meanwhile, statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. "There were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved," Spicer told reporters at a briefing. He refused to specify which if any committees were involved in the decision-making. Senior House leaders, including Ryan, did not see the text of the order until after it was signed Friday, according to a GOP aide. Antonia Ferrier, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said "it was public" that executive orders "were coming," but declined to offer further clarity on the level of interaction with the White House. Spokespeople for Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the senators were not consulted at all about the order. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said he could not confirm if his staff was consulted - but he personally did not weigh in on the executive order as it was being drafted. Grassley's committee is responsible for overseeing the majority of immigration-related legislation in the Senate. "I'm sure if they said they consulted us, they did," Grassley said. "But not me personally." A member of Grassley's committee staff worked alongside other congressional staff to assist the Trump transition team on legislative issues, including early drafting of the executive order, said one Senate GOP aide. However, that staff member did not participate in writing the final order. The White House did not share details of the order with the committee before its release on Friday, the aide said. Several GOP aides who requested anonymity to speak openly about the sensitive discussions said they were frustrated and surprised by the order and were forced to scramble to respond as chaos spread at airports across the country. Many said they felt the administration was moving too swiftly and without respect for critical protocol for vetting executive actions that have been in place for decades. "This is emblematic of a new, power-hungry White House staff flexing its muscles without consulting the public servants responsible for implementing their fiats. If this type of behavior continues, then this administration is going to lose all of its friends very quickly," said one Senate GOP aide. The freshly combative mood of Democrats has also begun to shape the debate over previously uncontroversial nominees. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who faces a 2018 re-election bid in a swing state, sent a letter to transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao on Monday with seven questions about enforcement of the ban. Failure to answer those questions overnight might be more reason to try delaying her final confirmation vote, aides said. In the end, Democrats are unlikely to derail the confirmation of any Trump nominees. While they can use procedural tactics to slow down the length of time it takes to confirm a pick, just 51 senators are needed to confirm a nominee. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate. That isn't likely to ease the pressure from the left. On Sunday night, more than a thousand protesters in Rhode Island, organized by the progressive Working Families Party, marched to an event held by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. At a rally outside the event, speaker after speaker denounced Whitehouse's vote last week to confirm CIA Director Mike Pompeo and demanded that he reject the rest of Trump's Cabinet. "Democrats alone can't block these appointments, but they can make sure they don't bear our stamp of approval," said David Segal, the executive director of the progressive transparency group, into a bullhorn. "They must vote as any one of us would vote - against surveillance, against authoritarianism, and against Trump." The Washington Post's Karoun Demirjian and David Weigel contributed to this report.

Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for Democratic National Committee leadership positions joined protesters at airports around the country. On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) fought back tears as he announced that Democrats would introduce legislation to stop the order. "This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American," he said, flanked by refugees at a news conference in New York. "Look at these faces! Are they any kind of threat to America? No, they're the promise of America." Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. And in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump's order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. "I think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support, that overturns the ban," Murphy said. "(The president) clearly campaigned on this ban, but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous." Given that stance, Murphy said, Democrats must "force a debate" this week on Trump's order by slowing consideration of the president's remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, his choice to serve as the next secretary of state. Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump's refugee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being weakened by federal judges overnight and having its constitutionality called into... "We should take every ounce of time that we're allowed on these nominees, to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration, especially when it comes to foreign policy," he said. Schumer and Democrats are eager to move quickly because they believe there is a rare opportunity to ride a wave of GOP opposition to Trump's moves. Democrats argue that one of the only ways they can influence policymaking in the next two years is to drive a wedge between Trump and members of his own party. At his news conference, Schumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and others. President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday.

President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday. Even as administration officials tried to clarify... Details of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants' rights issues, aides said. Schumer was working to coordinate the proposals Sunday; Murphy said he had received a call from the leader early in the day to confer. Democratic leaders were also exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump's orders - with the party seeking to once again tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has taken a leading role in Democratic messaging, said Sunday that the Senate needs "to pass legislation immediately which effectively rescinds Trump's un-American and unconstitutional ban on people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States" and to slow the nomination process. "Almost without exception, Trump's Cabinet nominees are extremely controversial and way outside of the American mainstream," Sanders said. "In my view, the Senate needs to take as much time as possible on the floor for a full discussion and debate about each of these nominees." For the party's restive base, that fight - just nine days into the new president's term - could not come soon enough. While Democrats have embraced the protests against Trump and Republican policies, and while some helped organize more than 70 rallies on Jan. 15 against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, progressives have criticized the party for not voting en masse against Trump's Cabinet picks. "You better show up ready to do real work on Monday after all this pro bono work we, the people, did for you on our day off," said CNN host W. Kamau Bell in a Saturday night tweet. In several cases, Democratic lawmakers took one of the most basic steps available to them as members of Congress: They provided services for constituents. Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N.Y., who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo after their arrival. In Houston, where the candidates for DNC roles participated in the second of four "future forums," activists filled a ballroom at Texas Southern University to ask why Democrats were not doing more. One attendee could be heard shouting, "Elizabeth Warren sold us out," a reference to her committee vote in favor of Ben Carson's nomination to become secretary for health and human services. On Saturday afternoon, before the protests had gotten fully underway, some of the Houston event's biggest cheers came when the candidates were asked whether they would oppose all of Trump's nominees - something no Democrat has done. "With what we have seen in the last seven days, I think we may be underreacting," South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. "We've got refugees who were vetted more than the Trump Cabinet was vetted," said former labor secretary Thomas Perez. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim member of Congress, said that the party needs to follow the lead of activists and that those activists are needed for direct action against Trump. "It is street action that creates the economic and social conditions for legislation to get passed," Ellison said. After the forum, Buttigieg joined Perez and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison at the protests breaking out at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. "We knew this would be a day of reckoning when Donald Trump assumed the Oval Office," Perez said to protesters. "Lady Liberty has taken a few body punches, but the American people will fight back." By Saturday night, many more elected Democrats were joining protests - and enabling them. After the Port Authority suspended the AirTrain that transports people from New York's subway to JFK Airport, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D-N.Y., reversed its decision. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., showed up at Philadelphia's airport in a tuxedo, having left a formal event to help local elected officials negotiate with customs officers to see stranded immigrants and refugees. At Dulles International Airport, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., did the same - to little avail. At Boston's Logan International Airport, Warren delivered a speech against Trump's order that was amplified by the crowd, a "people's microphone" that had been used by the Occupy Wall Street movement. And Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., joined marchers protesting Trump's travel ban outside the White House on Sunday afternoon. Booker, Harris and Warren, considered possible Democratic presidential contenders in 2020, had cast three of just 11 "no" votes against Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Murphy noted that the Senate quickly confirmed James Mattis, the revered former Marine general, to serve as defense secretary "because he assured us that he was going to argue against the very ban he watched Trump sign." At a summer 2016 roundtable, Mattis had said the idea of a "Muslim ban" would make actors in the Middle East think America had "completely lost it." "Many of us gave the president and his Cabinet a little benefit of the doubt last week," Murphy said. "I don't see that there's any reason that that should continue. Almost every single one of these nominees try to prop up their nomination by contradicting Trump in their confirmation hearing. It's pretty clear now that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are running this administration and the nominees that have been confirmed thus far have been marginalized." By Sunday afternoon, nearly every congressional Democrat had condemned the executive order, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., who faces a 2018 re-election campaign in a state Trump carried by 35 points. None defended it, but several remained silent. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned that Democrats can only do so much to try to stop Trump, given their diminished powers on Capitol Hill. "We're going to have to pick our battles in the next two years because we don't have the majority," he said. "There are so many moving parts here, and we need to prioritize what we respond to and what we propound. We have to be proactively propounding an alternative vision that recalls American core values." In the House, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a longtime advocate for immigrant and refugees' rights, is set to introduce a bill this week that would block implementation of Trump's order, according to senior House aides. And Pelosi informed colleagues Sunday afternoon that among the options her caucus would consider is filing an amicus brief in support of the American Civil Liberties Union if legal cases to block or reverse Trump's travel ban reach the Supreme Court. Connolly said that he and many other Democrats have been stunned by how organically Americans have been drawn into the streets to protest Trump's early decisions as president. Just days after the Jan. 21 Women's March on Washington, 200 more people than usual showed up at a regular meeting of the Fairfax County Democratic Party. "That's a sign," he said. "And there are all kinds of people networking and asking the question, 'What can I do?' There's not a sense of 'Throw up your hands, our fate is sealed.' It's quite the opposite. It wasn't a feckless, powerless act. It was a call to arms. And I believe it's going to lead to mass organizing across the country to resist this constitutional assault."

When bioethicist and oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, the session revealed publicly what has been happening privately for months: A trusted ally of former President Barack Obama and chief architect of the Affordable Care Act is trying to help steer how Republicans take it apart. With the administration and GOP leaders in Congress working to rewrite the landmark 2010 law - and Democrats displaying little appetite for negotiating with them - Emanuel appears to be one of the only members of his party with a seat at the table. Monday's meeting was Emanuel's third in-person conversation on health policy with Trump since the November election. According to one person familiar with the session, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private discussion, it took place in the Oval Office and lasted about 40 minutes. Among the others also attending were Vice President Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and the White House National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn. Details of the conversation were not immediately available. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed the meeting took place - only days before Ryan hopes to bring the bill to a House vote. "Obviously, [Emanuel] and the president have some differing views on the best way to make health care affordable and accessible," Spicer told reporters afterwards. "But the president also strongly believes that the health and well-being of the American people shouldn't always be a partisan issue," he said, noting that Trump also has talked about drug prices with Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. In an interview on Sunday, Emanuel recalled how during the ACA's drafting, Democrats held ongoing discussions with shifting groups of Republican lawmakers, even though no GOP members of the House or Senate ultimately supported the legislation. The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... The Republican health-care plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Sunday. "We think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does,"... Now, however, such bipartisan discussion of the future of federal health-care law "doesn't seem to be happening," said Emanuel, who chairs the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy. "I may be the only person on the Democratic side who, for crazy reasons, they've agreed to talk to." This role is a dramatic turnabout for the prolific health policy expert who served as a top adviser in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011 and was demonized at the time by many Republicans. In his 2014 book Reinventing American Health Care, Emanuel wrote that "beginning in 2020 or so, the ACA will increasingly be seen as a world historical achievement, even more important for the United States than Social Security and Medicare has been. And Barack Obama will be viewed more like Harry Truman - judged with increasing respect over time." While Emanuel is partisan, he also is pragmatic, and he has consistently maintained that the sprawling law needs improvement. He has argued that it should be altered to further expand insurance coverage, contain health costs, improve the health plans' affordability, and address the inconsistent caliber of health-care delivery in the United States. Ezekiel Emanuel, the older brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a key figure in health policy circles, came under fire from fellow doctors this week for declaring in a magazine article that he wants to die at the age of 75. In the article, which appeared in the October issue of The Atlantic... Ezekiel Emanuel, the older brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a key figure in health policy circles, came under fire from fellow doctors this week for declaring in a magazine article that he wants to die at the age of 75. In the article, which appeared in the October issue of The Atlantic... Following the election, the president-elect phoned Emanuel and said they would meet in January after the inauguration. Emanuel replied that they needed to talk sooner, because, if Congress repealed and replaced the ACA, it would "tank" Trump's presidency, Emanuel recalled. In mid-December, officials for the presidential transition announced that Emanuel would visit Trump at Trump Tower. Then last month, he met with the president at the White House. Along the way, he also has discussed health-care matters periodically with several of Trump's top advisers. "I take the president seriously when he says he wants to get everyone in the country covered," Emanuel said Sunday - a goal that could be an even bigger challenge under the Republians' American Health Care Act. A forecast last week by the Congessional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would lead to 24 million more uninsured Americans by 2026. In 2018 alone, the CBO projected, the number of people without health coverage could increase by 14 million. "There are ideas out there that are bipartisan, and I'm pushing those ideas," Emanuel said. They include the idea of automatically enrolling Americans in coverage with a minimum set of benefits. "It's not administratively simple, but it's got appeal." The conversations between the two men carry political risks for both sides. Emanuel's brother, Rahm, is the mayor of Chicago and a one-time Obama chief of staff who has clashed repeatedly with Trump over how best to address gun violence in that city. And the doctor has himself come under Republican fire before. Former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin once called him "Orwellian" for an op-ed in which he noted that many medical professionals support the idea of providing care to younger rather than older patients when resources are very scarce. Emanuel, who opposes physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, countered that critics had taken a single piece of his voluminous works of writing out of context. He has been an outspoken critic of the U.S. health-care system; his 2014 book's full title continues as "How the Affordable Care Act Will Improve Our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System." Under the ACA, he helped usher in changes to how health care is delivered, from accelerating the adoption of electronic medical records to making preventative health services more affordable. As a tenured professor who does not hold elected office, Emanuel has considerably more freedom than many other prominent Democrats. Even as he talks with the White House, he rejects the current House GOP legislation. It would leave many Americans without insurance who are currently covered without insurance, he said Sunday, and it fails to address the factors driving up health care costs. "In its present form, the bill is totally unacceptable to Democrats, myself included," he said. But Emanuel is accustomed to intellectual combat. In another of his books, he recounted what it was like to grow up with his equally ambitious and accomplished brothers (the other one, Ari, is a prominent Hollywood agent), who helped turn family dinners into verbal sparring matches. The bitter fight over the origins of the ACA taught him the danger of declaring victory - or defeat - too early, he says: "One thing you recognize is, it's not over til it's over."

Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher who traveled to the rally from Lexington with her daughter, mother, aunt and cousin. The price change was actually thanks to a subsidy made possible by former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, which is still in place, not by the tax credits proposed by Republicans as part of the health-care bill still being considered by Congress. It has been difficult for many Americans to keep up with the changes brought by Obamacare and exactly how the Republican proposal, if enacted, would affect their lives. But for Trump's most dedicated supporters, it's simply easier to trust the president is making things better and will follow through on his promise to provide "insurance for everybody" and "great health care for a fraction of the price." McComic said she's not worried about her disability benefits changing or her 3-year-old granddaughter getting kicked off Medicaid or her 33-year-old son's premiums going up. "So far, everything's been positive, from what I can tell," she said, waiting for Trump's rally here to begin Wednesday night. "I just hope that more and more people and children get covered under this new health-care plan." McComic says she has never trusted a president the way she trusts Trump. Ahead of the election, she and her relatives turned their cars into a "Trump train" and drove across Lexington, waving flags and shouting: "Trump! Trump! Vote for Trump!" She has watched all of the president's rallies on television and got in line for Wednesday's event at 7:30 a.m. "We said: 'Who else would we do this for, besides Trump?' " McComic said. "We agreed on the Lord. We would stand here for the Lord, but that's about it." Trump waited until the final minutes of his speech that night to discuss health-care restructuring. He glossed over the details of the legislation, blaming its troubles and complex path to enactment on Democrats and urging his followers to not believe their "dishonest attacks." And he did just enough to distance himself from the bill, describing it as a plan created by House Republicans "based on the principles I outlined." "The end result is . . . it's going to be great," the president said to gentle applause. "It's going to be great." The numbers are in on the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The numbers are in on the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Tennessee has become one of the GOP's go-to examples of why the Affordable Care Act is not working. Premiums for plans offered to state residents through a federal exchange skyrocketed last year - especially for those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies - and competition has dried up, with residents of most counties having access to only one insurance company. "It's a catastrophic situation," Trump said, as some of the supporters seated behind him held up campaign signs that read, "Promises made, promises kept." Serge Martin, a 63-year-old optometrist from Murfreesboro, said he doesn't particularly like the proposed legislation but considers it a "framework to get started with" that will be strengthened before it passes. Martin and his wife purchase health insurance through the exchange and have watched the price climb each year. For 2017, there was only one insurance company offering coverage in his area, UnitedHealthcare, and the couple's bill now totals $1,800 per month, with prescriptions costing another $250. With a deductible of $6,400, they rarely go to the doctor. "There just aren't any alternatives," he said. "That's the problem. There are no choices." Martin earns too much money to qualify for subsidies, but under the Republican legislation, he would be likely to receive a tax credit of several thousand dollars - although by the time that perk kicks in, Martin will probably be old enough to switch to Medicare. In the meantime, he's using savings to pay the bills. His friend Tim Weinberger, a 48-year-old owner of a small maintenance company, doesn't have that kind of cash and hasn't had insurance in at least a decade. The last time he saw a doctor was six years ago, after an accident. When Obamacare first started, Weinberger said, it would have cost him about $250 per month for a plan, which he couldn't afford. He assumes the price is even higher now. So Weinberger goes without insurance, as do his two employees. When filing his taxes, Weinberger says, he claims to have insurance to avoid having to pay a penalty he considers unfair. "It would be nice to have a doctor," he said, "just to check in on every once in a while." As several thousand of Trump's supporters gathered in the historic Municipal Auditorium on Wednesday, more than 2,500 protesters gathered outside. They urged their fellow Tennesseans to not trust the president's vague promises and to study the Congressional Budget Office's score of the bill, which estimates 24 million fewer people will have health insurance coverage by 2026 and that Medicaid would be cut by $880 billion over 10 years. They held signs that read: "Healthcare for all," "Don't take away my care," "Protect rural hospitals," "At least Obama cared" and "24 million." The Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act cleared a key hurdle Thursday, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists.

All of the panel's Republicans... Many of these activists have been fighting for years for the state to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which it never did, and now they face a future that's even bleaker. They warn that the proposed legislation is likely to lead to fewer children and pregnant women receiving care, less funding for nursing homes and rural hospitals, dramatic cuts to mental health and drug treatment programs, less support for the disabled, and large premium increases for those who had been receiving subsidies, especially older people with low or moderate incomes. "People are going to die, and that's the bottom line. People are going to die because of what we're doing with this legislation," said Sharon Cox, a former pediatric nurse who was once a director at a children's hospital, during a news conference ahead of Trump's visit. "As the funding goes away, as people can't afford the insurance that they need, as they wait longer for the care that they need, people are going to die. And, frankly, I think that's the bottom line." As Trump's supporters walked past these protesters, some said they weren't sure what or whom to believe. Several said that while the Republican plan isn't perfect, they believe it's probably better than the Affordable Care Act and its plans, which can cost more than a mortgage payment. A 51-year-old history teacher from northern Alabama said his 27-year-old son was kicked off the family plan on March 1 and has yet to find an affordable alternative. A 53-year-old self-employed construction worker watched his premium go from $133 per month several years ago to $803 this year, even though his income didn't change. A couple in their 50s who own a manufacturing plant in Decaturville say they stopped offering their 60 employees health insurance several years ago when plans on the exchange were cheaper - only to see the cost of those plans skyrocket beyond the means of their employees. When the federal health exchange first launched, Nancy Ware, 58, researched plans for her son, who works in the service industry and is now 35. At first, she said, he covered the cost of a $250-per-month plan. When it jumped to about $500, she covered half of the cost. Last year, when it grew to $700 per month, he decided to go without coverage and pay the fine, according to Ware. Now, she said the price tag is $900 per month, which would have been half of his wages. Ware is a landscaper and often works near Section 8 housing in the Nashville area, and she becomes furious when she sees residents who "drive better cars than I do, they have weaves and hair color better than I can, they have manicures." As Ware, who is white, waited in line for the rally to start, a group of young African-American protesters walked by, and she yelled at them, "Go cash your welfare checks!" "He gets penalized on his income taxes, while these people that don't know how to pull their pants up can go get it for free," said Ware, whose employer covers the full cost of her health care. "Make it even. Make it balanced." Ware hopes that Trump can change this, although she says she won't fault him if he can't. She doesn't believe news reports saying that 24 million people could lose their coverage under his plan. "Nothing is in concrete yet. Give the man a chance," she said. "Until you hear it from Donald J. Trump himself - and not the news media - then don't even worry about it. Wait until you hear the man say it, because he will tweet it, he will Facebook it or he will go onto national television and tell everybody at the same time."

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that his health care proposal must change to pass the House, marking a significant retreat from his earlier position that the carefully crafted legislation would fail if altered. The shift came after a private meeting of House Republicans from which Ryan, R-Wis., emerged to tell reporters that his proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would "incorporate feedback" from the rank-and-file. Ryan attributed the change of strategy to the impact of an analysis issued Monday by the Congressional Budget Office. Among other details that prompted a fresh round of criticism of the proposal was a projection that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured after one year under the Republican plan. Ryan backed away on Wednesday from his previous rhetoric of calling the measure's fate a "binary choice" for Republican lawmakers. "Now that we have our score ... we can make some necessary improvements and refinements to the bill," he said, referring to the CBO's estimate of the impact on the number of those covered by health insurance and what the GOP proposal would cost. Ryan did not detail what changes are under consideration. Vice President Pence also spoke to House Republicans in the meeting, acknowledging that changes to the legislation - which heads to the House Budget Committee for approval Thursday - are in the works. President Trump has offered his support for Ryan's measure, while still meeting with conservative lawmakers who have expressed serious doubts about the plan. "This president is ready to put the full weight of his bully pulpit and all of his tools" behind the bill, Pence told Republicans, according to Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. "It was very important for us to hear that, because there are a lot of people who need that shoring up." A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... Pence told conservatives that the plan was still under negotiation at a private lunch meeting of the Republican Study Committee, a large caucus of conservative House Republicans, according to several attendees. "As he said, it's not often that we get an opportunity to undo such a big piece of legislation that had negative consequences on the American people," said Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., paraphrasing Pence's message. "He's open to make improvements. ... Anything that can get 218 votes and make the bill better, we're all about it." Pence's visit to Capitol Hill - which included meetings with influential blocs of Republicans, as well as individual members - came as part of a White House effort to salvage support for the embattled American Health Care Act, even as President Donald Trump's conservative allies told him the bill could be a political trap. The legislation will face an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee meets to consider the legislation and advance it to the House floor. The committee may not directly amend the bill but may make nonbinding recommendations. Any substantive changes would be made by the House Rules Committee, which controls how the bill is presented and debated on the floor. The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., insisted that GOP leaders are not "dug in" when it comes to concerns about the measure. "We're listening; we're definitely listening," she said Wednesday to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. "And I will tell you: Tune in to our Budget Committee tomorrow, and you will hear these conversations." The blitz came two days after the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured next year under the GOP plan. The falling coverage numbers and estimates of higher premiums for older and low-income Americans raised concerns among many lawmakers, particularly those representing states that expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA. Ryan, R-Wis., plans to hold a House floor vote next week, and Trump administration officials have spent the last two days in near-constant discussion with Republican lawmakers as they scramble to find enough votes to pass the measure. Leaders were set to take a preliminary count of members supporting the bill Wednesday night. Critics of the legislation warned Wednesday that the measure remains far short of the 216 votes needed for passage. Typically, 218 votes are needed to pass a bill in the 435-member House, but five pending vacancies have reduced that threshold. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, and with 237 Republicans, party leaders can afford no more than 21 defections. "They will whip it, and they will find 40 nos and another 30 or 40 undecideds," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who has called for changes to mollify conservatives. One member of the Budget Committee who belongs to the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said he will vote against the bill in committee. Two other Freedom Caucus members, as well as three others on the panel, have not said how they will vote. One conservative Budget Committee member who has voiced concerns about the bill said Wednesday that he had been convinced to advance it. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., said he would support the legislation in the panel based on an "implied promise that things are going to be different on the floor, and therefore we can keep the process moving." He declined to say who had made that promise: "People higher up on the food chain than me." "I'll say this, if the bill that comes to the floor is the exact same one in Budget, I'll feel a little bit that I'd been had," he said. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., acknowledged in an MSNBC interview Wednesday that the bill remains under negotiation. "Watching sausage being made is not the prettiest thing," he said. "What can we do on those final pieces that are being negotiated with President Trump and a number of our members in our conference that ultimately want to get to a yes vote and send this bill over to the Senate?" Ryan spent much of Tuesday and Wednesday giving interviews in an attempt to drum up support for the plan. On the Fox Business Network, he defended the plan as a collaboration with Trump and the Senate and said "the major components are staying intact" while opening the door to "refinements and improvements." Later, in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, he countered reports that the White House's support for the bill might be slipping. Ryan said he had spoken to chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump's chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon "a number of times" about the bill, and he noted that Trump had brought lawmakers to the White House multiple times to make the case for the legislation. "We are on the same page as the White House," Ryan said. "I think there are those who would love to wedge us for one reason or another, but that's just not the case." Hours later, at a rally for Obamacare opponents outside the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told activists that the House plan "has a lot of problems" but could possibly be modified into a "real repeal" of the ACA. "I believe we can get it done," Cruz said. "I can tell you, the last week, four days, I've been at the White House meeting with the president, with the vice president, saying, 'We've got to get it done.'" Various changes have been floated since the bill was unveiled earlier this month. Conservatives have pushed for an earlier phase-out of the ACA's Medicaid expansion, moving it from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2018, but GOP moderates in both the House and Senate have pushed back on that notion. "Doing that would be a nonstarter and would be enormously and hugely problematic for many of our members," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. Meadows said Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus is closely focused on repealing more of the ACA's mandates governing the extent of insurance coverage. "That is probably the No. 1 priority," he said. "If we can get those, it would make the rest of it a whole lot easier." GOP leaders, however, have kept those provisions out of the pending legislation, arguing that their inclusion could threaten the bill's passage in the Senate and that many of those mandates can be undone through Trump administration actions. In another sign of the effect of the CBO report, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., floated a proposal to recalibrate the tax credits established under the House bill to offer more substantial help to low-income Americans. The House bill would offer assistance to individuals making as much as $115,000 a year; Thune's amendment would phase out aid for those making about $75,000 or more. "We want to build on what the House has done, and we think that this amendment does that," Thune said. "It just makes it more defensible both in terms of the policy implications and the politics."

A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing talk radio, as well as among friends who have Trump's ear, the message has been blunt: The plan is being advanced by congressional Republican leaders is deeply flawed - and, at worst, a political trap. Trump's allies worry that he is jeopardizing his presidency by promoting the bill spearheaded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wis., arguing that it would fracture Trump's coalition of working- and middle-class voters, many of them older and subsisting on federal aid. Vice President Mike Pence and administration officials scrambled Tuesday to salvage the plan amid widespread dissatisfaction in both the Senate and House over the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that 24 million fewer people would be insured in a decade under the Ryan proposal, titled the American Health Care Act. The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... Trump - who has not yet fully used the bully pulpit of the presidency to rally support for the plan - spoke privately with Ryan on Tuesday afternoon. They discussed the various factions, the opinions of several key members and developing a closing strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the call. Trump loyalists warned that the president was at risk of violating some of his biggest campaign promises - such as providing broad health coverage for all Americans and preserving Medicaid and other entitlement programs - in service to an ideological project championed for years by Ryan and other establishment Republicans. "Trump figures things out pretty quickly and I think he's figuring out this situation, how the House Republicans did him a disservice," said Christopher Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. "President Trump is a big-picture, pragmatic Republican, and unfortunately the Ryan Republican plan doesn't capture his worldview." Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, published a column Tuesday urging Trump to "ditch" the current bill. Inside the White House, senior officials said they are taking note of the mounting opposition. "You can't be so blind that you're not seeing the outside noise," said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to speak publicly. A second adviser, who also requested anonymity to speak candidly, said, "We take their views seriously and we're listening, but we do appreciate when those concerns are shared privately and with a smaller megaphone." Keeping Republicans on edge are several Trump advisers with tenuous ties to Ryan and the party establishment who might be more responsive than others to outside pressure, including chief strategist Stephen Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare." The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare." The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The White House strategy has been to spotlight what it sees as the urgent need to overhaul the health-care system rather than the legislative fix itself. At his Tuesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer highlighted "real life examples" of "actual Americans" who shared with Trump stories of suffering in a listening session Monday. "These are the stories that are at the top of the president's mind as he works towards reforming our health-care system," Spicer said. This fresh public agitation from Trump loyalists comes as hard-line Republicans in Congress already stand opposed to the health-care bill. These lawmakers, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, see the proposal as insufficiently conservative because it is too reliant on tax credits and does not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, the law often known as Obamacare that was signed by President Barack Obama. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the president should not be tempted by outside calls to abandon the Ryan bill and should instead "let the legislative process work." "What's happening now is a gut check," he said. "It's not unusual. People are figuring out what they're going to stand tight on." The cascade of opposition within Trump's movement started flowing soon after the bill was unveiled last week and picked up speed this week. On Breitbart - the anti-establishment, conservative news site that has been a platform for Trumpism and was once run by Bannon - article after article has railed against a bill its headline writers excoriate as "RyanCare." One heavily promoted story said that RyanCare was "a perverse economic system," featuring an interview with Rep. David Brat, R-Va., a tea-party hero who unseated then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014. House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... Breitbart published leaked audio of Ryan on Monday that could undermine his relationship with Trump. The recording is of Ryan on a conference call with House Republicans last year, immediately following the release of the "Access Hollywood" video in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Ryan said on the call that he was "not going to defend Donald Trump - not now, not in the future." Breitbart also has been promoting a rally Wednesday on Capitol Hill organized by FreedomWorks, a right-wing advocacy group that stoked the tea-party movement. The event will feature Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas, Mike Lee, Utah, and Rand Paul, Ky., who oppose Ryan's health-care bill. Paul told reporters Tuesday that the plan was losing momentum: "There's not really any kind of coalition that's going to get the Ryan bill to pass. I think the CBO score makes it harder for him to pass his bill, and he's losing the argument." The rush by Ryan to quickly pass the health-care bill concerns some of Trump's top supporters, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. "I don't think Americans care whether this bill passes by Easter or Memorial Day," Cotton said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. Republican strategist John Brabender said he observed a number of focus groups of Trump voters in Rust Belt states and found them willing to be patient about the timetable for overhauling health care. Brabender said the White House "should take a deep breath and not feel like anybody has to rush out and sign something they don't feel good about. ... They have to be careful not to just quickly check a box and then own something around their neck for years." Cotton dismissed promises from Trump and Republican congressional leaders of an evolving, multiphase process that would continue throughout the year. "There is no three-phase process," Cotton said on Hewitt's show. "There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk. It's just politicians engaging in spin." At the White House, Spicer was confronted at his briefing about Cotton's criticism as an example of the administration lacking control over what its own supporters are saying. "It's a free country," Spicer said. "He can say what he wants."

The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... Rush Limbaugh echoed Cotton's concerns on his airwaves Tuesday. The conservative talk-radio commentator said the message from congressional leaders is: "We gotta pass the bill. We gotta send it up to president. No matter what's in it, we gotta pass the bill." "Passing the bill becomes the measure of success," he continued, "and so that's when the real dangerous horse-trading begins." Limbaugh has sounded protective of Trump, explaining on his show last Friday that the president's supporters should give him time to work out a better deal because he is "inside the sausage factory" for only the first time. "Trump is probably finding out just how deeply intertwined the tentacles of this are throughout our society, and what happens when you remove one tentacle?" he asked. "You find six more pop up that you didn't know were there." Fox News host Eric Bolling, who once considered joining the Trump administration and is friendly with the president, published an op-ed Tuesday on the network's website that said Ryan and the "establishment GOP have pulled a fast one on President Trump." "It's time for President Trump to scrap the GOP health-care bill," Bolling wrote. Conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham, a friend of Trump's who was considered for a job in the White House, said Tuesday on Fox News that the Ryan bill is a "trap." "I think Donald Trump is going to get caught on this in 2020," she said, referring to the president's reelection. "I'd like to spend an hour talking to him about it. I think this is a trap set for Trump, and it's going to be bad." Former senator Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who was a key player in the battle over the Affordable Care Act in 2010, said of the current situation: "The Republicans are in an impossible position." "Most of the people who are in opposition to this have never governed, don't know how to govern and don't want to govern," Gregg said. "Unfortunately, Republicans now control the government and have to learn how to govern. The Laura Ingrahams of the world, who make their money agitating, aren't functional in a situation where the president has to govern." The Washington Post's David Weigel contributed to this report.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured next year under the GOP plan, Vice Mike President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price went to Capitol Hill to rally backing for the proposal. But widespread dissatisfaction among House and Senate lawmakers - conservatives and moderates alike - showed no signs of dissipating, increasing the chances that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will have difficulty passing the bill if it goes to the House floor in the next two weeks, not to mention whether it can collect a majority in the Senate. "I have serious concerns about the current draft of the House bill," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview Tuesday. "As written, I do not believe the House bill would pass the Senate." House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday.

House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... The White House is putting its political capital behind the Ryan proposal, however, sending emissaries to the Hill and meeting with skeptical lawmakers - including Cruz, who went to the White House on Tuesday along with a small group of fellow conservatives. Trump has enthusiastically backed the GOP plan invarious statements and tweets, and its failure - or the failure of a similar measure - would probably tarnish his promise to replace Obamacare with a better system. The president also planned to speak about health care with Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by phoneTuesday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., attempted to play down the severity of the GOP split after a closed-door party lunch attended by Pence, Price and some of the architects of the House bill, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Following the lunch, McConnell tried to shift the focus from the coverage numbers to more favorable terrain for Republicans: the CBO's projection that Ryan's plan would reduce the federal budget deficit over the next decade and produce a 10 percent average decrease in premiums after that. "Regarding the projection of fewer people purchasing, I think that's the inevitable result of the government not making you purchase something you may not want," McConnell told reporters. "And so we are hoping to have a more vibrant market that will attract a greater number of people to actually be able to buy, at an affordable cost, insurance that actually makes sense for them rather than one prescribed by the government." Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who is normally chatty with reporters, was more guarded than usual coming out of the meeting. He declined to discuss specifics but said House leaders and the White House were making a good-faith effort to hear the concerns of Republican senators. "They really are taking input. So I don't think they would be over here unless they really do want to take input from folks," Corker said.

The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The GOP legislation faces an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee will meet to combine pieces passed by separate committees into a single bill and advance it to the House floor. The budget panel cannot make substantive changes to the bill, but it can make nonbinding recommendations before it goes to the floor for a final vote. Several members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, which has expressed serious concerns that the measure does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare, are on the Budget Committee and could decline to support the bill there. Republicans hold an eight-vote advantage over Democrats on the Budget Committee, and if four GOP members oppose it, the bill could stall. Three of the 22 Republicans on the panel are members of the House Freedom Caucus. Aides to those three members - Reps. Dave Brat, Va., Gary Palmer, Ala., and Mark Sanford, S.C., - did not respond to inquiries Tuesday about whether they intended to support the legislation in committee. Three other Budget Committee Republicans, Reps. John Faso, N.Y., Mario Diaz-Balart, Fla., and Bruce Westerman, Ark., said Tuesday that they were undecided on their committee votes. Near the close of the Tuesday Senate lunches, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the head of the Freedom Caucus, was seen walking down a hallway near the room where the lunch was held. "We've got some work to do, still," said Meadows, adding that he had received "no assurances" from the White House or anyone else about changes to the bill that would attract his support. Among the commitments that White House staff members have pledged to support is a series of amendments at the budget panel this week, according to one senior White House official. But special budget rules established more than four decades ago make that plan impossible to fulfill. Budget Committee members do not have the authority to offer any substantive or binding amendments to the legislation. The committee's sole job is to combine the recommendations of previous committees - which have passed the GOP proposal - and send the legislation to the House Rules Committee. Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade.

Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., said Tuesday that she is in talks with her members about potential "motions" to ask the Rules Committee to modify the bill when it takes it up, probably early next week. "Really our role and responsibility is to take the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce bills and put them together," Black said in an interview. Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., the Budget Committee's vice chairman, said Tuesday that while the panel cannot directly make changes to the bill, members can suggest recommendations. "I think that is fair game if you're trying to be an honest broker and better the bill, and I think we should welcome that kind of discussion," he said. "If you're doing it because you want to sabotage the bill, you're going to find guys like me swat that down pretty vehemently." Rokita said he has attempted to persuade the bill's skeptics by asking: "Do they not have the courage to do the big thing? And that's how I'm framing it with them." The House Republicans' legislation would keep a few of the ACA's most popular features, such as forbidding insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting medical problems, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. The plan would erase penalties the ACA imposes on people who do not buy health coverage and, instead, would have a deterrent: a 30 percent surcharge on premiums that insurers could levy for a year if consumers let their coverage lapse. The bill would remove the ACA's subsidies, replacing them with generally smaller tax credits available to people with somewhat higher incomes, and it would give more help to younger adults than older ones. The tax credits could be used for any plan sold in a state as long as it didn't provide coverage for abortion. The legislation would gradually eliminate an expansion of Medicaid, the public insurance program for lower-income Americans, that was accepted by 31 states under the ACA and would give states an annual fixed sum based on the number of people in the program. The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count.

The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... Moderate Republicans from states that expanded Medicaid have voiced concerns that the bill would not do enough to protect those who obtained coverage through that expansion. They worry that the projected deficit reduction would not be enough of a benefit to compensate for the number of people who stand to lose coverage. "These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday of the CBO report. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.,, a physician and strong ACA critic, sounded apprehensive about the CBO report's implications. "President Trump said that he wants as many people covered as under Obamacare," Cassidy said Monday. "He said that health care should be affordable. If there's 14 million people losing insurance, of course it's concerning." On the right, conservatives have complained that the bill is not a forceful enough rollback of the Obama administration's health-care law. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Cruz, hasbeen a chief conservative critic of the law. "There is a solution for House Leaders that conservatives have offered: abandon Obamacare Lite now," Paul wrote Tuesday on Twitter. "It is bad law & it can't pass." In a later tweet, he added: "If House leaders try do a little less using the same basic framework as the failed Obamacare experiment, then it will fail too." Lee also raised concerns in an editorial for the conservative Daily Signal that the House bill contains policy changes that would violate strict Senate rules. One such worry involves a provision that would forbid the use of insurance tax credits for coverage of health-care providers that offer abortion services. But moderates warned that addressing the conservatives' concerns would threaten their own support. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Leonard Lance, R-N.J., said Tuesday that they would oppose the bill, while Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., - a leader of the moderate GOP faction - said he has "serious concerns and reservations" about supporting the measure without changes.

President Donald Trump agreed to add fresh Medicaid curbs to the House Republican health care bill Friday, bolstering the measure with support from some conservative lawmakers but leaving its prospects wobbly. House leaders discussed other amendments calibrated to round up votes and scheduled a showdown vote Thursday. "I just want to let the world know I am 100 percent in favor" of the measure, Trump said at the White House after meeting around a dozen House lawmakers and shaking hands on revisions. "We're going to have a health care plan that's going to be second to none." While the rapid-fire events seemed to build momentum for the pivotal GOP legislation, its fate remained clouded. One leading House conservative said the alterations were insufficient and claimed enough allies to sink the measure, and support among moderates remained uncertain. "My whip count indicates that there are 40 no's," enough to defeat the bill, said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who leads the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. He said the change "doesn't move the ball more than a couple yards on a very long playing field." Across the Capitol, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., facing re-election next year, became the fourth Republican senator to announce his opposition. That left Senate GOP leaders at least two votes shy of what they'd need to prevail. Congressional Democrats remain solidly opposed to the GOP effort. Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Soon after Charla McComic's son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a "blessing from God" that she believes was made possible by President Donald Trump. "I think it was just because of the tax credit," said McComic, 52, a former first-grade teacher... Thursday will mark the seventh anniversary of when Obama signed his health overhaul into law, one of his milestone domestic achievements enacted over unanimous GOP opposition. Beyond that symbolism, Republican leaders hope to allow time for Congress to complete the measure before an early April recess exposes lawmakers to two weeks of lobbying and town hall pressure tactics by activists, doctors, hospitals and other opponents. The Republican bill would kill much of former President Barack Obama's health care law, including tax penalties for people who don't buy insurance and its expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. It would create new tax credits that would be less generous than current federal subsidies for many consumers, and repeal levies on the wealthy and medical firms that helped finance Obama's expansion of coverage to 20 million Americans. Trump's deal with lawmakers would let states impose work requirements on some of Medicaid's roughly 60 million recipients. The condition would apply to healthy people with no dependents, a White House official said. The agreement would let states accept lump-sum federal payments for Medicaid, instead of an amount that would grow with the number of beneficiaries. The program currently costs the federal government around $370 billion annually and covers costs no matter the amounts. Also, any additional states that expand Medicaid would not receive the additional federal money Obama's law provided them for doing so. Thirty-one states have enlarged their Medicaid rolls under the law. "These changes definitely strengthen our numbers," said the House GOP's top vote counter, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, among Trump's guests Friday. "But they also show that President Trump is all-in now" to help win converts.

The Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act cleared a key hurdle Thursday, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists. All of the panel's Republicans... Those accepting the agreement included Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., leader of the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives. It seemed clear that GOP leaders remained short of the 216 votes they'll need, and additional changes were in the works. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said he'd been assured by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that the bill's tax credit would be adjusted to focus more benefits on lower-income people. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., among those who met with Trump, said the president "told his people" to work on changes making the measure more generous for lower-earning and older Americans. "Everything has to be a change that would increase the vote count," Scalise said. Conservatives seemed unlikely to achieve their demands that the GOP bill's phase-out of Obama's Medicaid expansion — now 2020 — be accelerated to next year and that the credit be denied people with little or no tax liability. Centrists remained wary of yanking constituents from coverage. Many represent states where voters have gained Medicaid and other insurance under the 2010 statute. "We'll see what changes they're going to make," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. In a report this week that prompted many GOP lawmakers to emerge as opponents, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would leave 24 million people uninsured in a decade, including 14 million next year, and boost out-of-pocket costs for many. Heller joined three fellow GOP senators in opposing the bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas have voiced strong objections, and Senate moderates don't want to boot constituents off coverage. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority. Nevada has expanded Medicaid and GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval has expressed opposition to the Republican legislation.

House GOP leadership faced mounting opposition Tuesday after introducing an Obamacare repeal and replace bill that was rejected by small government conservatives, panned by Republican moderates and given only lukewarm support from President Trump. One day after unveiling the GOP’s long-promised effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better, the new American Health Care Act already appears to be on life support, unlikely to survive the onslaught of friendly fire unless Trump personally rallies his party. But Trump’s intervention looks uncertain. While the president embraced “our wonderful new healthcare bill” in an early morning tweet, he also suggested it’s just a starting point “for review and negotiation” — opening the floodgates to alternative ideas and proposals that could take weeks to sort out. Later, in a White House meeting with House Republicans, he offered a stronger endorsement, saying he was "proud to support" their plan and expected it to pass “very quickly.” At the same time, though Trump is also accepting back-channel calls from conservative Republican opponents — including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — who are warning him off legislation they view as nothing more than a revamped federal entitlement program. Conservative lawmakers are being backed by the Koch network, whose supporters rallied outside the Capitol on Tuesday, and other influential groups including Heritage Action and Club for Growth. They dismiss the GOP leadership’s bill as “Obamacare 2.0” or “Obamacare lite.” “This is not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who is leading the GOP opposition with Paul and the House Freedom Caucus. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has also raised objections. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... “We promised the American people we would drain the swamp and end business as usual in Washington. This bill does not do that,” Lee said. “This is exactly the type of backroom dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for, and it is not what we promised the American people.” For seven years Republicans have promised to end Obamacare, and after winning repeated congressional elections on their promise to repeal and replace the law, they were confident Democrats would have no choice but to join them. But Democrats have shown no interest in the GOP bill, saying it would drop millions of Americans from healthcare coverage without offering them viable alternatives. Rather than being spooked by their November election losses, Democrats have been buoyed by the outpouring of support for Obamacare by constituents and protesters flocking to lawmakers’ town hall meetings across the country. “This Republican bill will do massive damage to millions of families across the nation,” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader. She called it a “Make America Sick Again bill that hands billionaires a massive new tax break while shifting huge costs and burdens onto working families across America.” Without much backup, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) is nevertheless pressing forward with an ambitious committee hearing schedule Wednesday, ahead of an expected House vote this month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expected passage in the Senate before the spring recess in April. But the GOP leaders are largely standing alone for now and will need more political muscle to heave the bill to passage. The White House dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for his regular Senate Republican lunch and to meet with other GOP lawmakers, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told White House reporters he “looked forward” to working with critics on the bill. But it is increasingly clear Republicans will need more than the mild diplomacy of these two former congressmen to hammer resistant Republicans into line. Republicans can afford to lose no more than about 20 lawmakers in the House and two in the Senate under special rules that allow passage of the legislation with a simple majority. Trump’s bully pulpit would provide a stronger nudge. “I like the president’s statement that it’s up for negotiation,” Paul said on Fox News, adding he spoke to Trump on Monday. “The negotiation will be conservatives saying, ‘Hey, we’re not going to take Obamacare lite.’” The architects of the House bill — Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee — urged their colleagues Tuesday to give the bill a chance. They are also betting that few Republicans would want to be blamed for preventing the party’s best chance to date at derailing Obamacare. “We can act now or we can keep fiddling around and squander this opportunity,” Brady said. The Republican bill would dramatically revamp the Obamacare system by shifting healthcare costs away from the federal government and onto patients and states. House Republicans on Monday released their long-awaited plan for unraveling former President Barack Obama's health care law, a package that would scale back the government's role in helping people afford coverage and likely leave more Americans uninsured. House committees planned to begin voting... House Republicans on Monday released their long-awaited plan for unraveling former President Barack Obama's health care law, a package that would scale back the government's role in helping people afford coverage and likely leave more Americans uninsured. House committees planned to begin voting... The GOP legislation ends the Obamacare subsidies that help some Americans buy health insurance and replaces them with monthly tax credits for consumers who buy their own insurance policies. Those credits, up to $14,000 a year for families, are phased out for individuals earning more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for couples. The Republican plan also phases out, in 2020, the expansion of Medicaid that some states chose to participate in under Obamacare, halting the federal funding that helps states pay for healthcare for the poor and disabled. Dismantling the Medicaid expansion is particularly worrisome to GOP senators from Ohio, West Virginia, Colorado and Alaska because they fear their states will be unable to provide health coverage for needy residents. “I want to be sure that during that transition period people aren’t left high and dry,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told reporters. The bill keeps some popular provisions of Obamacare, such as allowing young adults to remain on their parents’ plans until they are 26. But it does away with others, including one that restricts insurers from charging older patients for policies three times more than for younger people. The GOP bill allows older customers to be charged five times as much. A full accounting of the costs and numbers of people who will gain or lose coverage is expected soon from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and some lawmakers criticized GOP leaders for pressing forward without that complete assessment. Other Republican lawmakers, though, said the GOP plan would require Americans to budget their money more wisely rather than rely on the government for help. The Republican plan will expand opportunities for Americans to sock more of their own money away into health savings accounts that can be used to pay for healthcare costs, they say. “Americans [have] got to make a choice, and so maybe instead of getting that new iPhone ... they should invest in their own healthcare,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). Republicans' new health-care bill is a mass transfer of wealth that cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while cutting federal benefits for the middle and working class.

Major associations representing physicians, hospitals, insurers and seniors all leveled sharp attacks against the House GOP's plan to rewrite the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, as some Republicans publicly questioned whether the measure can clear the House of Representatives. While industry groups warned that the proposal could leave vulnerable Americans with fewer protections than they now have, GOP leaders pressed ahead, bringing legislation before two key committees that are expected to approve the bills by week's end. They were also working in concert with the White House to win over conservatives, who have complained that the proposal preserves too much of the current law. The flurry of activity — including an evening meeting between President Donald Trump and leaders from five skeptical conservative groups — created new uncertainty about the viability of Republicans' signature promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The day's events also showed the uneasy predicament facing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the proposal's chief booster, who described the plan Wednesday as a "conservative wish list" that would deliver on years of GOP campaign promises to change the nation's health-care system. "Right now I feel confident saying there aren't 218 votes for this," said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who was referring to the number of votes needed to pass the measure out of the House. Perry opposes the proposal. The barrage of criticism shows how fraught the terrain of health-care policy is. It also reflects a backlash prompted at least partly by the breakneck speed with which House Republicans are trying to push through their proposal — with little upfront effort to work with interest groups or political factions. "What we're seeing now is that the political prospects for repealing the Affordable Care Act are as daunting as the effort to pass national health reform," Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs, said in an interview. President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... House Republican leaders have given little indication that they will make anything but marginal changes to their plan, which would eliminate the requirements that all Americans obtain coverage or pay a tax penalty and that businesses with at least 50 employees provide insurance. The American Health Care Act would replace income-based subsidies with refundable tax credits based on age and income, charge individuals a 30 percent surcharge if they buy a plan after allowing their coverage to lapse and phase out the law's more generous Medicaid funding over time. While conservatives complained that these changes don't go far enough, they have sparked criticism not just from Democrats but from moderate Republicans, AARP, the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association. "We cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations," James Madara, chief executive of the American Medical Association and a doctor, wrote in a letter to committee leaders overseeing work on the bill. Richard Pollack, CEO of the American Hospital Association, voiced similar fears, saying efforts to "restructure the Medicaid program" by shifting it from an entitlement program to one based on a per capita allocation "will have the effect of making significant reductions in a program that provides services for our most vulnerable populations and already pays providers significantly less than the cost of providing care." America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest trade association, sent a letter Wednesday saying that while it appreciated several of the proposed changes, the changes to Medicaid "could result in unnecessary disruptions in the coverage and care beneficiaries depend on." House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., told reporters Wednesday that critics were exaggerating the proposal's potential repercussions. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... "It's tough to do entitlement reform, it's tough to make these changes, but I think at the end of day, seniors are going to be fine," Walden said. "If you're on Medicaid today, you'll be on Medicaid tomorrow. States can intercede here and help out. So there's more to this story." Walden said it was "sort of shocking" that hospital groups were strongly opposing the plan, because the GOP legislation restores the ACA's cuts to "disproportionate share" payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of uninsured patients. "There's a pretty big medical-industrial complex in America," he added. "And when you touch it, I've discovered, it touches back." House Republicans' determination to deliver on their promise to undo the ACA — Ryan said Wednesday that it is "the covenant we made with the American people when we ran on a repeal-and-replace plan in 2016" — has spurred a legislative drive that is happening at warp speed. A cadre of lawmakers and staffers worked behind closed doors for several weeks to draft the pair of bills, which were designed to move through the annual budget process in order to clear the Senate with a simple majority vote. But that process, which did not involve an extended period of negotiation with interest groups or consultation with Democrats, has produced a furious backlash. Some insurers, including Molina Healthcare and the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said they did not get to offer any input into the House proposal. "It doesn't seem like the industry got any heads-up or was involved. We definitely were not," Sunny Yu, spokeswoman for Molina Healthcare, which has about a million members in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, said in an email. Democrats threw up procedural obstacles Wednesday in the committee meetings and on the House floor, complaining that it was irresponsible to consider the bills before the Congressional Budget Office offered an analysis that showed the legislation's impact on the budget and Americans' overall health care coverage. "We need to know, what this is going to cost?" asked Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. "We need to know, what kind of health insurance is going to be feasible?" Both House Republicans and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney have predicted that they will have a CBO "score" ready by early next week, before the bills are combined and brought before the House Budget Committee. GOP staffers noted that other health care bills, including the 21st Century Cures Act and the 2015 reauthorization bill for Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, began their journeys through congressional committees without a CBO score. Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee moved to delay the bill's consideration for 30 days, while those on Ways and Means moved to delay it for one week to allow for further hearings and to examine the CBO report. Both motions were voted down on a straight party-line vote, and the panels continued working into the evening. Still, the most imminent threat GOP leaders must contend with comes from the far right. The speaker can lose only 21 Republican votes if the American Health Care Act is to pass, and opponents are promising to use that leverage to force changes to the bill. Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va., a freshman member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he was confident that his camp could help reshape the legislation. While Trump had endorsed it already, Garrett said, he would probably be willing to accept something else if it were changed in a way conservatives could support. "This is a guy who said he wasn't sure that NATO, in its classic role, is necessary — and then two months later we saw countries like Germany vow to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP," said Garrett. "Why'd they do that? Because Donald Trump wasn't going to accept the status quo. They made a counteroffer. Right now, there's an offer, and he's saying he likes to get people to make counteroffers."

One day after unveiling the GOP’s long-promised... Vice President Mike Pence met with two House Freedom Caucus leaders Tuesday, and that same day Mulvaney — a former caucus member — spent more than an hour at a meeting of the group. Its members have been invited to visit the White House next Tuesday. Wednesday night, Trump met with leaders from Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, the Heritage Foundation and its political arm, Heritage Action, and the Tea Party Patriots. But the hard reality for Republicans is that any changes made to appease House conservatives could threaten the bill's support among moderates. "My fear is that the bill will go backwards," said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group who has gotten White House attention of his own: He met Tuesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. "If the bill starts going in the reverse direction in order to satisfy certain members of my party, then I'm going to have a problem. I think the federal government has a role to play here, and I'm not looking to just see the federal government undermine the health care needs of the American people." Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a pivotal Republican moderate, said in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo News' Katie Couric that the current House measure would "not be well received in the Senate" and stood no chance of passing as is. "I want us to slow down to take more time to be sure we get this right." The Washington Post's David Weigel, Carolyn Johnson, Elise Viebeck and Amy Goldstein contributed.

Republicans' new health-care bill is a mass transfer of wealth that cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while cutting federal benefits for the middle and working class. Just two provisions in the Republican plan would allow the richest households to pay an average of nearly $200,000 less under the Republican plan, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. For the lower-middle class, the plan would replace the current system of benefits based on income with a new system based on age. As a result, a young person making less money would get less help to buy insurance than an older person who is making more. The GOP measure unwinds many of the provisions of Obamacare, which offered health insurance subsidies to millions of middle-income households and funded them in part through new taxes on the wealthy. Republican proponents of the bill argue that by eliminating regulations on health insurance, their legislation will reduce the price of coverage for the middle class, making up for the financial pain of reduced government support. Some experts, however, are skeptical that the plan will work as intended. "If the plan is successful in theory at lowering health insurance premiums, that's particularly a powerful economic benefit for low income people who struggle to afford health insurance," said Avik Roy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... But Roy added that those benefits will not make up for the reduced subsidies: "The regulatory changes are a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, they don't go far enough," he said. "That's going to cause problems for a number of people." - For the rich Wealthy Americans -- especially those households with incomes above $200,000 -- would be better off under the bill primarily because they would no longer pay two major taxes levied as part of the Affordable Care Act. One is a tax of 0.9 percent on taxpayers earning more than $200,000 in wages and salaries a year, or $250,000 for married couples. Those households must also pay a surcharge of 3.8 percent on income from several kinds of investments. Together, these taxes are projected to raise $346 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... The taxes aren't limited to the wealthy, but the wealthy would get the lion's share of the benefits of their repeal. The richest percentile of families pay 77 percent of the tax on high wages and salaries, and 90 percent of the tax on investments, according to the Tax Policy Center. And the very rich would fare even better. The center projects that the average household from the top 0.1 percent of income distribution would save $31,000 a year if the tax on high salaries were repealed, and another $165,000 each year without the tax on investments. - For the middle and working class At the same time, working- and middle-class households would no longer receive the same financial assistance that Democrats established to help them buy health insurance. Under Obamacare, help was available in the form of health insurance subsidies to people with modest incomes -- those who are not legally impoverished, but who make less than about $48,000 for an individual taxpayer, or about $90,000 for a family of four. Under the Republican plan, Americans would receive tax credits based primarily on their ages, not their incomes. Individual earners making less than $75,000 a year would receive a fixed benefit based on their ages, with older taxpayers receiving more because of the increased cost of insurance for older patients. Taxpayers making more than that amount would receive a less generous credit, but those earning any amount less than that would receive the same payment as other people of the same age. As a result, a single 45-year-old earning as much as $75,000 a year could be better off under the Republican plan, since that taxpayer would not receive help under the current system, established under Obama. Meanwhile, a single 45-year-old making half that amount would receive the same payment as the wealthier taxpayer of the same age. That payment might be less generous than the one she would receive in the existing system, depending on where she lives. Roy pointed out that some provisions in the Republican bill could help the middle class financially. For instance, the bill would repeal a tax on tanning beds, and it would further delay a tax on especially generous health-insurance plans. This tax, known as the Cadillac tax, often applies to plans that employers offer to members of unions. Among households with roughly middling incomes, about 12 percent would enjoy a tax cut if the tax on these plans were repealed, according to the Tax Policy Center. For families that would benefit, the relief would be worth about $930 a year on average. The Republican plan would also reduce taxes on health savings accounts, which some middle-class families use to prepare for medical expenses. This provision, however, would likely have greater benefits for wealthier families, who can save more and can better take advantage of savings accounts that are sheltered from taxes as a result. Also, the bill would eliminate some regulations on health-insurance plans that Democrats imposed. As a result, insurance companies would be able to offer less comprehensive but cheaper insurance. For some families, Roy said, those skimpier plans could be an opportunity to save money. Roy warned, however, that those savings would likely not make up for the reduction in subsidies for taxpayers in the middle class and would leave many Americans unable to afford health care. - For the poor Finally, the plan would likely make Medicaid, the federal program that provides health insurance to the poor, less generous over the long term. Obamacare gave states the option to expand the criteria for qualifying for Medicaid and offered federal funds to pick up the vast majority of the associated costs. Under the GOP plan, however, that expanded criteria for qualifying for Medicaid would go away after 2020, at which time states would not be able to enroll new or returning patients from the expanded criteria in the program. Meanwhile, the federal Medicaid payments to states will be limited based on the number of residents in poverty and the prices of medical treatment. These limits will not be adjusted based on the average age of each state's residents or if states confront unexpected costs, said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist who served as a health-care official in the Obama administration. As a result, the resources available to care for poor Americans could decline relative to what states would receive in the existing system, especially as the population ages. On the whole, Aron-Dine said, the Republican bill would increase inequality, reducing taxes for the wealthy at the expense of affordable insurance for ordinary Americans. "Millions of people are going to lose their health coverage," she said. "Millions or tens of millions of people are going to see higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs."

The center projects that the average household from the top 0.1 percent of income distribution would save $31,000 a year if the tax on high salaries were repealed, and another $165,000 each year without the tax on investments. - For the middle and working class At the same time, working- and middle-class households would no longer receive the same financial assistance that Democrats established to help them buy health insurance. Under Obamacare, help was available in the form of health insurance subsidies to people with modest incomes -- those who are not legally impoverished, but who make less than about $48,000 for an individual taxpayer, or about $90,000 for a family of four. Under the Republican plan, Americans would receive tax credits based primarily on their ages, not their incomes. Individual earners making less than $75,000 a year would receive a fixed benefit based on their ages, with older taxpayers receiving more because of the increased cost of insurance for older patients. Taxpayers making more than that amount would receive a less generous credit, but those earning any amount less than that would receive the same payment as other people of the same age. As a result, a single 45-year-old earning as much as $75,000 a year could be better off under the Republican plan, since that taxpayer would not receive help under the current system, established under Obama. Meanwhile, a single 45-year-old making half that amount would receive the same payment as the wealthier taxpayer of the same age. That payment might be less generous than the one she would receive in the existing system, depending on where she lives. Roy pointed out that some provisions in the Republican bill could help the middle class financially. For instance, the bill would repeal a tax on tanning beds, and it would further delay a tax on especially generous health-insurance plans. This tax, known as the Cadillac tax, often applies to plans that employers offer to members of unions. Among households with roughly middling incomes, about 12 percent would enjoy a tax cut if the tax on these plans were repealed, according to the Tax Policy Center. For families that would benefit, the relief would be worth about $930 a year on average. The Republican plan would also reduce taxes on health savings accounts, which some middle-class families use to prepare for medical expenses. This provision, however, would likely have greater benefits for wealthier families, who can save more and can better take advantage of savings accounts that are sheltered from taxes as a result. Also, the bill would eliminate some regulations on health-insurance plans that Democrats imposed. As a result, insurance companies would be able to offer less comprehensive but cheaper insurance. For some families, Roy said, those skimpier plans could be an opportunity to save money. Roy warned, however, that those savings would likely not make up for the reduction in subsidies for taxpayers in the middle class and would leave many Americans unable to afford health care. - For the poor Finally, the plan would likely make Medicaid, the federal program that provides health insurance to the poor, less generous over the long term. Obamacare gave states the option to expand the criteria for qualifying for Medicaid and offered federal funds to pick up the vast majority of the associated costs. Under the GOP plan, however, that expanded criteria for qualifying for Medicaid would go away after 2020, at which time states would not be able to enroll new or returning patients from the expanded criteria in the program. Meanwhile, the federal Medicaid payments to states will be limited based on the number of residents in poverty and the prices of medical treatment. These limits will not be adjusted based on the average age of each state's residents or if states confront unexpected costs, said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist who served as a health-care official in the Obama administration. As a result, the resources available to care for poor Americans could decline relative to what states would receive in the existing system, especially as the population ages. On the whole, Aron-Dine said, the Republican bill would increase inequality, reducing taxes for the wealthy at the expense of affordable insurance for ordinary Americans. "Millions of people are going to lose their health coverage," she said. "Millions or tens of millions of people are going to see higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs."

Vice President Mike Pence forcefully defended the Trump administration's plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Thursday night, saying the law known as Obamacare is a "nightmare" and that the administration is committed to "an orderly transition" to a new health-care system. Addressing a gathering of conservative activists in the Washington area, Pence sought to minimize the voices of the hundreds of people who have demonstrated against changes to the law at congressional town hall meetings across the country. "America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end," Pence said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. "Despite the best efforts of liberal activists around the country, the American people know better. Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go." Pence said he and President Donald Trump are committed to giving every American "access to quality, affordable health insurance," and want to replace the current system with one that allows people to purchase health coverage across state lines as they would insurance for their automobiles. "We'll have an orderly transition to a better health-care system that finally puts the American people first," Pence said. In his 21-minute speech, Pence ticked through a broad array of issues on which the administration has acted or plans to act soon, including cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, ending illegal immigration, expanding the military and restoring what he termed the "culture of life." Former House Speaker John Boehner predicted on Thursday that a full repeal and replacement of "Obamacare" is "not going to happen." The Ohio Republican, who was forced out by conservatives in 2015, said he started laughing when he heard President Donald Trump and Republicans promise swift action...

Pence spoke of Trump as a historic figure in American politics, saying he is a modern-day Ronald Reagan. "Men and women of the conservative movement, this is our time," Pence said. Like the president, Pence voiced disdain for the media and sought to portray news organizations as the administration's political opponent. "The media, the elites, the insiders, everybody else who profits off preserving the status quo, they dismissed our president," Pence said. "They're still trying to dismiss all of us." He added, "This is not a government of the elites, by the media or for the establishment. What Nov. 8 showed, even if they didn't listen, is this is still a government of the people, by the people and for the people."

President Donald Trump's first speech to Congress left Republicans encouraged and enthusiastic Wednesday, yet still confronting thorny divisions on health care, taxes and more. Trump's disciplined and optimistic tone was what GOP lawmakers wanted to hear after a rocky first month that provoked daily anxiety on Capitol Hill with each new presidential tweet. Republicans welcomed Trump's presentation and his call for "a new chapter of American greatness." "It's just one speech, but I think what we see is a guy who comes from outside the political process now weaving his way through into becoming an effective leader," said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga. Vice President Mike Pence said on MSNBC Wednesday morning that Trump showed Congress and the nation his "broad shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future." Heralding a "new chapter of American greatness," President Donald Trump issued a broad call for overhauling the nation's health care system and significantly boosting military spending Tuesday night, swapping his trademark pugnaciousness and personal insults for a more restrained tone as he addressed... Heralding a "new chapter of American greatness," President Donald Trump issued a broad call for overhauling the nation's health care system and significantly boosting military spending Tuesday night, swapping his trademark pugnaciousness and personal insults for a more restrained tone as he addressed... And House Speaker Paul Ryan declared the speech a "home run." Yet even though Trump offered some specifics on health care and appeared to embrace a key element of a leadership-backed plan emerging in the House, his comments did little to settle an extremely difficult debate over Republicans' top legislative priority. Indeed, a day after the president called for "unity and strength," Republicans looked as divided as ever as they try to make good on seven years of promises to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's health care law. Most said Trump's speech hadn't changed that or brought them much closer together. "I don't know that that was his intent," said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. "But I mean he gave the kind of guidelines that I think most presidents give on issues like this and it's up to us." As Republicans cheered and Democrats sat silently Tuesday night, Trump declared: "We should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government." Those were comments House GOP leaders interpreted as an embrace of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a new system built around refundable tax credits. President Trump’s well-delivered speech to Congress on Tuesday night answered one major question — whether he could offer the country a less divisive tone — but provided almost no clarity about how he hopes to fulfill the promises that he made in his campaign. In addition to “massive” tax cuts... President Trump’s well-delivered speech to Congress on Tuesday night answered one major question — whether he could offer the country a less divisive tone — but provided almost no clarity about how he hopes to fulfill the promises that he made in his campaign. In addition to “massive” tax cuts... But conservatives who've been rebelling against that plan, denouncing the credits as a costly new entitlement, disagreed. And they showed few signs of backing down, although Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., leader of a large group of House conservatives, conceded Wednesday that the refundable tax credits likely will be included in the GOP leadership plan, adding he would try to limit the cost of those credits. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has joined Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky in declaring their opposition to the legislation emerging in the House, accused the media of "bending over backwards" to interpret Trump's remark as a specific legislative proposal. Cruz insisted that Congress should begin by passing legislation that simply repeals Obamacare like a bill Obama vetoed in early 2016. "That should be on the (Senate) floor. And from there we should build up, and we should focus on areas of consensus," Cruz said. "We should not focus on ideas that divide us and pull us apart." The stance adopted by Cruz, Lee and Paul provoked familiar backbiting from other Republican senators who fear that the rebels could block action given the GOP has few votes to spare with a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. "We do have some problems with two or three people on our side that make it so if this becomes a partisan vote we won't have the votes," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "So yeah, it's a problem, it's a big problem."

The text of President Donald Trump's speech to Congress, as released by the White House: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded... Amid the divisions, Trump lunched with top House and Senate GOP leaders, where the group discussed working more closely together on their joint goals, according to the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas. "I think you're going to see a lot greater coordination, much better communication, because I think that's the key to our success," Cornyn said. GOP senators met with two leading authors of the House health care proposal and participants said talks among Republicans would continue, suggesting that differences remained. Cruz called the meeting "robust" and added, "I think the discussions will continue for some time." Trump's comments on another massive legislative priority, overhauling the loophole-ridden tax code, also did not appear to move the needle. A vague overture on immigration was welcomed by some, yet with no details provided its future was cloudy. The president repeated his call for a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, but that could provoke a confrontation with deficit hawks and is on the back burner on Capitol Hill anyway given the enormous legislative lifts on health care and taxes that loom first. And Trump's failure to say anything about Medicare and Social Security, the massive entitlements that are eating up the budget, left some Republicans complaining that he was ducking political reality. "The president has a saying, 'All talk, no action.' His budget is all talk and no action when it comes to long-term indebtedness," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters Wednesday.

The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail, current and former U.S. officials said. The message, delivered by Sally Q. Yates and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel, was prompted by concerns that Flynn, when asked about his calls and texts with the Russian diplomat, had told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the Obama administration sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, the officials said. It is unclear what the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, did with the information. Flynn resigned Monday night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. In the waning days of the Obama administration, James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yates' concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that "Flynn had put himself in a compromising position" and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. A senior Trump administration official said before Flynn's resignation that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that "we've been working on this for weeks." The current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn't rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition. The FBI, Yates, Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter. In a Feb. 8 interview with The Washington Post, Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials. One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he "couldn't be certain that the topic never came up." Two officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions. Officials also said there was no evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what Flynn had discussed. Flynn told The Post earlier this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013, when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia.

President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn... U.S. intelligence reports during the 2016 presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn, officials said. Communications between the two continued after Trump's victory on Nov. 8, according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matter. Kislyak, in a brief interview with The Post, confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election, but he declined to say what was discussed. For Yates and other officials, concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama administration on Dec. 29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlin's interference in the election in an attempt to help Trump. After the sanctions were rolled out, the Obama administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation. To the surprise of many U.S. officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Dec. 30 that there would be no response. Trump praised the decision on Twitter. Intelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putin's move. The search turned up Kislyak's communications, which the FBI routinely monitors, and the phone call in question with Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with years of intelligence experience. From that call and subsequent intercepts, FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynn's discussions with Kislyak. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn's comments in the intercepted call to be "highly significant" and "potentially illegal," according to an official familiar with her thinking. Yates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure U.S. statute known as the Logan Act, which bars U.S. citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another country. At the same time, Yates and other law enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act, a statute that has never been used in a prosecution. In addition to the legal and political hurdles, Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia, which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communications. Word of the calls leaked out on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Post columnist David Ignatius. "What did Flynn say, and did it undercut U.S. sanctions?" Ignatius wrote, citing the Logan Act. The next day, a Trump transition official told The Post, "I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever." White House press secretary Sean Spicer, in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 13, said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had "centered on the logistics" of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. "That was it, plain and simple," Spicer added. On Jan. 15, Pence was asked about the phone call during an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation." Citing a conversation he had with Flynn, Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak "did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia." Before the Pence statement on Jan. 15, top Justice Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communications. Pence's statement on CBS made the issue more urgent, current and former officials said, because U.S. intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call, contrary to public statements. The internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan. 19, Obama's last full day in office. Yates, Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter. The officials discussed options, including telling Pence, the incoming White House counsel, the incoming chief of staff or Trump himself. President Donald Trump is "evaluating the situation" regarding his embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn's conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., the White House said Monday, deepening the uncertainty surrounding Flynn's future in the new administration.

Flynn apologized... FBI Director James B. Comey initially opposed notification, citing concerns that it could complicate the agency's investigation. Clapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in, but Yates stayed on as acting attorney general until Jan. 30, when Trump fired her for refusing to defend his executive order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries - an action that had been challenged in court. A turning point came after Jan. 23, when Spicer, in his first official press briefing, again was asked about Flynn's communications with Kislyak. Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue "again last night." There was just "one call," Spicer said. And it covered four subjects: a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir; Christmas greetings; Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil war; and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump. Spicer said that was the extent of the conversation. National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Yates and the senior career national security official spoke to McGahn, the White House counsel, who didn't respond Monday to a request for comment. Trump has declined to publicly back his national security adviser since the news broke. On Monday afternoon, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn. Minutes later, however, Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to reporters. "The president is evaluating the situation," Spicer's statement read. "He's speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: Our national security." And then late Monday, Flynn resigned. The Washington Post's Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump's embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump's senior team after less than a month in office. In a resignation letter, Flynn said he gave Vice President Mike Pence and others "incomplete information" about his calls with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The vice president, apparently relying on information from Flynn, initially said the national security adviser had not discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy, though Flynn later conceded the issue may have come up. Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser. Kellogg had previously been appointed the National Security Council chief of staff and advised Trump during the campaign. Trump is also considering former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a U.S. Navy SEAL, for the post, according to a senior administration official. The Trump team's account of Flynn's discussions with the Russian envoy changed repeatedly over several weeks, including the number of contacts, the dates of those contacts and ultimately, the content of the conversations. A look at three possible national security advisor replacements following Michael Flynn's resignation. Feb. 14, 2017. A look at three possible national security advisor replacements following Michael Flynn's resignation. Feb. 14, 2017. Late last month, the Justice Department warned the White House that Flynn could be in a compromised position as a result of the contradictions between the public depictions of the calls and what intelligence officials knew to be true based on recordings of the conversations, which were picked up as part of routine monitoring of foreign officials' communications in the U.S. A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition. An administration official and two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed the Justice Department warnings on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. It was unclear when Trump and Pence learned about the Justice Department outreach. The Washington Post was the first to report the communication between former acting attorney general Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, and the Trump White House. The Post also first reported last week that Flynn had indeed spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Trump never voiced public support for Flynn after that initial report and continued to keep his national security adviser close. But White House officials sent contradictory messages about Flynn's status. Counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn, while press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was "evaluating the situation" and consulting with Pence about his conversations with the national security adviser. Asked whether the president had been aware that Flynn might have planned to discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said, "No, absolutely not." The Kremlin had confirmed that Flynn was in contact with Kislyak but denied that they talked about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers mounted a fierce defense of Flynn. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee at the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said in a post on Facebook that firing a national security adviser for his contacts with Russia is "not just paranoia but something even worse." Kosachev also expressed frustration at the Trump administration: Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: no one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot.President Donald Trump accepted Flynn's resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading... Michael Flynn set a record on Monday with his resignation as the White House national security adviser: no one in the 64-year history of the role had a shorter tenure than his, not by a long shot.President Donald Trump accepted Flynn's resignation late Monday, after Flynn acknowledged misleading... "Either Trump hasn't found the necessary independence and he's been driven into a corner... or russophobia has permeated the new administration from top to bottom," he said. Kosachev's counterpart at the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, tweeted shortly after the announcement that "it was not Flynn who was targeted but relations with Russia." Flynn's discussions with the Russian raised questions about whether he offered assurances about the incoming administration's new approach. Such conversations would breach diplomatic protocol and possibly violate the Logan Act, a law aimed at keeping citizens from conducting diplomacy. Administration officials said that misleading Pence was ultimately Flynn's downfall, though they insisted he resigned and was not fired by Trump. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Flynn's resignation "does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians." He said the White House has yet to be forthcoming about whether Flynn was acting at the behest of the president or others. The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially...

Flynn's resignation comes as Trump and his top advisers seek to steady the White House after a rocky start. The president, who seeks input from a wide range of business associates, friends and colleagues, has been asking people their opinions on his senior team, including Spicer and chief of staff Reince Priebus. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he was viewed skeptically by some in the administration's national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia. In 2015, he was paid to attend a gala dinner for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed television station, and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the event. Flynn apologized to Pence about the matter on Friday, according to an administration official. The official said Pence was relying on information from Flynn when he went on television and denied that sanctions were discussed with Kislyak.

A growing group of Democratic lawmakers will boycott President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration Friday as a protest of Trump's worldview and his criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, congressman of Georgia. There are now nearly 40 House Democrats - 38, at last count - who have declared that they will not attend the inauguration on Capitol Hill this week. The number rose sharply after Trump tweeted Saturday that Lewis is "all talk, talk, talk" and should "finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities." Lewis, who sees Trump's Nov. 8 win as illegitimate because of Russia's alleged interference in the election, is best known for leading civil rights protests in the 1960s, including the 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in which state troopers brutally attacked the crowd.

President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared chummy as they faced a curious world together for the first time Friday, pledging allegiance to the special relationship between their countries while trying to mask stark differences on some major issues. It was Trump's first White House meeting with a foreign head of state, a hastily arranged confab held precisely one week after the businessman and reality TV star, who remains a largely unknown figure to European audiences, was sworn into office as president. Trump sought to charm May from the outset, showing her the bust of Prime Minister Winston Churchill that he's using to decorate the Oval Office. He then opened a joint news conference by noting that his late mother was born in "Stornoway, which is serious Scotland." Scotland is part of Great Britain. Trump and May were seen briefly holding hands as they walked along the White House colonnade after leaving the Oval Office. Their talks continued in the State Dining Room over lunch of iceberg wedge salad, braised beef short ribs with potato puree and salted caramel crème brulee. For her part, May congratulated Trump on his "stunning election victory," and announced that he had accepted the queen's invitation for a state visit for the president and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, later this year. But the attempts at mutual flattery didn't completely mask the leaders' differences over some issues, including NATO and Russia. May tried to push Trump toward positions she supports, noting that he had assured her he was "100 percent" behind NATO, a world body he has dismissed as "obsolete." Trump did not contradict May as they stood together and answered journalists' questions in the White House East Room. British Prime Minister Theresa May, speaking Thursday before a group of Congressional Republicans, warned President Donald Trump he cannot trust Russian President Vladimir Putin. "When it comes to Russia, as so often, it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who - during negotiations... British Prime Minister Theresa May, speaking Thursday before a group of Congressional Republicans, warned President Donald Trump he cannot trust Russian President Vladimir Putin. "When it comes to Russia, as so often, it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who - during negotiations... May also took a tougher stance on sanctions against Russia. When asked how close the U.S. is to lifting penalties that were imposed on Russia after its incursion into Ukraine, Trump said it was "very early to be talking about that." May said sanctions should remain until a 2015 cease-fire agreement for Ukraine is fully implemented. Trump has been less critical of Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, than his predecessor and some lawmakers, including fellow Republicans. He has cast doubt on findings by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the presidential election to help him win the White House, and has praised Putin's leadership. Trump's stance has fueled speculation that he could ease or remove the sanctions against Russia. Trump also reiterated his belief that torture works. Britain takes a vocal stand against it. The appearance alongside May was more amiable than Trump's most recent public appearance with a foreign leader: a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto last August. Trump was more staid and serious then, and read from lengthy prepared remarks. European Union nations bracing for the looming Donald Trump presidency showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the EU itself. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the U.S. president-elect's... European Union nations bracing for the looming Donald Trump presidency showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the EU itself. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the U.S. president-elect's... Coincidentally, Trump and May met a day after Pena Nieto canceled his own trip to Washington next week amid disagreement with Trump over which of their countries will pay for the wall Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump says Mexico will pay; Mexico says it won't. Trump is something of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. They also don't know his administration's main interlocutors with foreign governments, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive. So May was on a bit of a scouting mission. She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union and its 500 million-person single market, and is eager for a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. The United States is Britain's biggest export market, and such a trade deal would be a major prize. Trump has drawn parallels between Britain's choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote last June to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements. Often combative in the presence of journalists, Trump seemed relaxed and humorous alongside May. At one point, after a British journalist asked whether people should be alarmed by his past statements, Trump joked: "This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship." He backed May's determination to make Britain strong and prosperous once it leaves the European Union, saying he thought Brexit would be "a tremendous asset and not a tremendous liability." And when asked whether the two very different leaders had found common ground, Trump said they had. "I think we're going to get along very well," he said. "I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa." Associated Press

In a "60 Minutes" interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration in January. "What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate," Trump told "60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl, according to a preview of the interview released by CBS. "But we're getting them out of our country. They're here illegally." Stahl had pressed Trump about his campaign pledge to deport "millions and millions of undocumented immigrants." Trump told her that after securing the border, his administration would make a "determination" on the remaining undocumented immigrants in the country. "After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about -- who are terrific people. They're terrific people, but we are gonna make a determination at that," Trump said. "But before we make that determination ... it's very important, we are going to secure our border." His comments echoed those he had made at the start of his campaign: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best," Trump had said last June when he announced his candidacy. "They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Trump's campaign promises also included fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall and banning Muslims from entering the U.S. Since winning the election, Trump and his key advisers have been backing away from some of those promises, and Republican leaders who made the Sunday political-show circuit seemed to approach the issue of mass deportations more cautiously. "I think it's difficult to do," Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" earlier Sunday morning. "First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we'll have discussions." McCarthy also hedged on the border wall, saying Republicans were focused on "securing the southern border" but with the aid of technology rather than necessarily a full-length brick-and-mortar wall. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's former campaign manager, said it was incumbent upon Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders to calm their supporters and encourage a peaceful transition of power after anti-Trump demonstrations have swept U.S. cities since Election Day."(Trump...

House speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that securing the border was their top priority. "We are not planning on erecting a deportation force," Ryan said. "Donald Trump is not planning on that." Regarding his border wall plans, Trump told Stahl on "60 Minutes" that he would accept fencing along some of the border, as Republicans in Congress have proposed. "For certain areas, I would. But for certain areas a wall is more appropriate," Trump said. "I'm very good at this. It's called construction." On Thursday, former House speaker Newt Gingrich admitted that Trump would likely not focus on getting Mexico to pay for the wall, as the candidate had promised during his campaign, but that it had been "a great campaign device." CBS had released on Saturday two preview clips of same "60 Minutes" segment, Trump's first televised interview since winning the election last week. Even before Donald Trump chooses a Supreme Court nominee, the new president can take steps to make several contentious court cases go away. Legal challenges involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care and transgender rights all could be affected, without any help from Congress.... Even before Donald Trump chooses a Supreme Court nominee, the new president can take steps to make several contentious court cases go away. Legal challenges involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care and transgender rights all could be affected, without any help from Congress.... Seated with his wife, Melania, and his four adult children, Trump spoke to Stahl about his seemingly shifting position on Obamacare, saying he would try to preserve key parts of the health care act, and also praised Hillary Clinton as "very strong and very smart." Trump told Stahl that Clinton's phone call conceding the election was "lovely" and acknowledged that making the phone call was likely "tougher for her than it would have been for me," according to previews of the interview released by CBS. "She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, 'Congratulations, Donald, well done,'" Trump told Stahl. "And I said, 'I want to thank you very much. You were a great competitor.' She is very strong and very smart." Trump's tone in the interview was in sharp contrast to his bitter attacks on the campaign trail, in which he nicknamed Clinton "Crooked Hillary" and encouraged chants of "Lock her up!" at his rallies. Among other insults, Trump also referred to his competitor as "the devil," "a bigot" and -- at the tail end of the final presidential debate -- "such a nasty woman." Trump also told Stahl that former president Bill Clinton called him the following day and "couldn't have been more gracious." "He said it was an amazing run -- one of the most amazing he's ever seen," Trump said. "He was very, very, really, very nice." The chant echoed through Donald Trump's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: "Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!" "We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests," the billionaire real... The chant echoed through Donald Trump's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: "Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!" "We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests," the billionaire real... During the campaign, Trump had tried to use Bill Clinton's infidelities as a way to attack and embarrass Hillary Clinton. For the second presidential debate, Trump had sought to intimidate his competitor by inviting women who had accused the former president of sexual abuse to sit in the Trump family box. Debate officials quashed the idea. In the interview with Stahl, Trump did not rule out calling both of the Clintons for advice during his term. "I mean, this is a very talented family," he said. "Certainly, I would certainly think about that." Trump also reiterated on "60 Minutes" that he may keep portions of the Affordable Care Act, something he had mentioned he might do after meeting with President Barack Obama in the White House on Thursday. When Stahl asked whether people with pre-existing conditions would still be covered after Trump repealed and replaced Obamacare, Trump said they would "because it happens to be one of the strongest assets." "Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we're going to... very much try and keep that," Trump added, referring to portions of the health care act that cover children under their parents' insurance through age 26. "It adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep." When Stahl questioned whether there would be a gap between the repeal of Obamacare and the implementation of a new plan that could leave millions of people uninsured, Trump interrupted her. "Nope. We're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. It's what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff," Trump said. "We're going to repeal and replace it. And we're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you'll know. And it will be great health care for much less money." The "60 Minutes" interview will be broadcast on CBS at 6 p.m. CST Sunday.

At least 18 million people would lose health insurance in the first year if Republicans re-create previous plans to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The number of people without insurance would grow to about 32 million within the first decade if Congressional Republicans follow a 2015 plan to repeal the health-care law without a replacement, the new report says. It also estimates that health insurance premiums for people buying individual non-group coverage would go up by about 50 percent in a decade, further complicating GOP promises that people will not lose coverage under their plan. The report comes as Republican leaders in Washington are working furiously to tamp down concerns within their ranks that a speedy push to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act could create chaos in the insurance markets and provoke backlash from voters. Last weekend, President-elect Donald Trump promised in an interview with The Washington Post that he was nearing completion of a plan to provide "insurance for everybody." Trump did not provide any details of what that plan would include. Trump vows 'insurance for everybody' in Obamacare replacement plan The new report sparked bickering among lawmakers Tuesday as Republicans dismissed the report, arguing that the forthcoming GOP repeal plan will also include some elements of replacement. "This projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare," said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Senate Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., requested the report to provide an updated estimate of the impact of a 2015 repeal measure that ended in a veto from President Barack Obama. Republican leaders have said that they plan to closely model an upcoming repeal measure on that 2015 legislation and conservative groups have openly touted that bill as a "dress rehearsal." President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law with the goal of "insurance for everybody," while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices... President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law with the goal of "insurance for everybody," while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices... "Nonpartisan statistics don't lie: it's crystal clear that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for millions of Americans and kick millions more off of their health insurance," Schumer said in a statement." But Republicans insist that a plan they are working on a replacement plan. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., the third ranking Republican in the House, responded Tuesday by dismissing the report on Twitter. "The CBO report assumes no Obamacare replacement. In reality, we will provide people with coverage that they want and can actually use," he posted. Congress took its first step toward rolling back Obama's health-care reform law Friday when House voting along party lines to pass a budget measure that paves the way for a repeal vote in the coming months. Committees in the House and Senate are set to begin writing legislation that will roll back major elements of the health care law, including penalties for those who don't get insurance and credits that help people buy insurance on the private market.

Republicans are now facing the far more difficult difficult task of assembling a viable replacement for a law that has expanded health insurance coverage to roughly 20 million Americans and eliminated unpopular insurance industry practices, such as lifetime coverage caps and widespread refusal to cover already-sick individuals. The Washington Post's Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Republicans would slash federal dollars for Planned Parenthood as part of the GOP effort to repeal the health care law. Ryan spoke a day after a special House panel issued a report criticizing the organization, which provides birth control, abortions and various women's health services, for its practices regarding providing tissue from aborted fetuses to researchers. The Wisconsin lawmaker's comments, while expected, were the first official word that repeal legislation would also renew the congressional assault on the group. "The Planned Parenthood legislation would be in our (repeal) bill," Ryan said. Last year's Obamacare repeal measure also contained the effort to defund the group, which receives government reimbursements from the Medicaid program for non-abortion health services to low-income women. It also receives reimbursements for contraception services from a different government account. The defunding measure would take away roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from the group in the year after enactment, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care. One factor is that being enrolled in Medicaid doesn't guarantee access to a doctor, so women denied Medicaid services from Planned Parenthood may not be able to find replacement care. "Defunding Planned Parenthood is dangerous to people's health, it's unpopular, and it would leave people across the country without care," said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards. "They cannot afford to have basic reproductive health care attacked. Planned Parenthood has been here for 100 years and we're going to be here for 100 more." Democrats have an emerging strategy to defend the Affordable Care Act from Republican assault, daring their opponents to defy the "Pottery Barn rule": They're about to break the health-care system, and that means they will own it. For more than six years, Republicans have attacked unpopular parts... Democrats have an emerging strategy to defend the Affordable Care Act from Republican assault, daring their opponents to defy the "Pottery Barn rule": They're about to break the health-care system, and that means they will own it. For more than six years, Republicans have attacked unpopular parts... President-elect Donald Trump sent mixed signals during the campaign about the 100-year-old organization. He said "millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood," but he also endorsed efforts to defund the group. Trump once described himself as "very pro-choice," but now opposes abortion rights. Cutting off Planned Parenthood from taxpayer money is a long-sought dream of social conservatives, but it's a loser in the minds of some GOP strategists. Planned Parenthood is loathed by anti-abortion activists who are the backbone of the GOP coalition. Polls, however, show that the group is favorably viewed by a sizable majority of Americans — 59 percent in a Gallup survey last year, including more than one-third of Republicans. The defunding effort could also complicate Obamacare repeal in the Senate, where at least one GOP member — Susan Collins of Maine — cited the defunding language in opposing the repeal effort in late 2015. Last year's elections thinned Republican ranks in the Senate to 52, so only a handful of GOP defections are possible if the repeal measure is going to pass. The Republicans may have a way out of their "repeal and replace" Obamacare position, which is proving a lot more difficult than they realized. The catch is that their alternative may be even more phony. It could phonier than the "repeal and rename" strategy I anticipated. For years, I've said that... The Republicans may have a way out of their "repeal and replace" Obamacare position, which is proving a lot more difficult than they realized. The catch is that their alternative may be even more phony. It could phonier than the "repeal and rename" strategy I anticipated. For years, I've said that... Asked Wednesday about party efforts to tie the effort to defund Planned Parenthood to Obamacare repeal, Collins said, "that's of concern to me as well, but I don't want to prejudge what's in the ... bill." Most GOP lawmakers have long opposed Planned Parenthood because many of its clinics provide abortions. Their antagonism intensified after anti-abortion activists released secretly recorded videos in 2015 showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to researchers, which is legal if no profit is made. The House GOP report issued Wednesday accused the group of violating federal laws by altering abortion procedures to obtain fetal tissue, disclosing patients' private information to firms that procure the tissue and "a general disinterest in clinical integrity." Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and did so again Wednesday. The group has strong support from Capitol Hill Democrats. A supporter of the defunding effort said it may not have much of an effect on the number of abortions performed in the country, but that federal dollars to Planned Parenthood indirectly support abortion. "A lot of the ongoing support in the structural finances for Planned Parenthood goes to build the buildings, the infrastructure that provides abortion," said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.

When former attorney general Eric Holder Jr. came under fire for leaks of classified information about the Obama administration's role in authorizing cyberattacks against Iran, he turned to a veteran federal prosecutor - a Republican - to help head his investigation into who was leaking. That same federal prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, is being tapped again, this time by President Donald Trump's attorney general, to oversee another high-profile case, the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling and any links between Russian officials and Trump's associates. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself Thursday from the investigation and designated his acting deputy attorney general, the second-highest-ranking official in the Justice Department, to oversee the probe. But the responsibility is expected to soon fall to Rosenstein, 52, the longest-serving U.S. attorney, whose Senate confirmation hearing to become deputy attorney general is set for Tuesday. Rosenstein, the sole holdover U.S. attorney from the George W. Bush administration, is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans for his experience working on sensitive cases in the face of political pressure, according to attorneys he has worked with during his nearly three decades in the department. "I cannot imagine a more challenging environment in which to be the deputy attorney general than what we have now," said Jason Weinstein, a former Justice Department official who worked with Rosenstein during the administrations of Bush and Obama. "And I cannot imagine a better person for the job at this time than Rod. He is not political at all. In every decision he makes - and I've seen him make some very difficult ones - the only question he really cares about is what is right and what is just." A Philadelphia native, Rosenstein began working as a trial attorney in the public integrity section of President George H.W. Bush's Justice Department after graduating from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, and clerking for Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Contrary to what he told Congress at his confirmation hearing, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions did indeed “have communications with the Russians” when he was a top Trump campaign advisor on national security. But did Sessions commit perjury? Perjury accusations have bedeviled many other Cabinet secretaries... Contrary to what he told Congress at his confirmation hearing, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions did indeed “have communications with the Russians” when he was a top Trump campaign advisor on national security. But did Sessions commit perjury? Perjury accusations have bedeviled many other Cabinet secretaries... Soon afterward, President Bill Clinton's deputy attorney general hired Rosenstein to be his counsel. During the Clinton administration, Kenneth Starr tapped him to be his associate independent counsel on the investigation into the business dealings of the Clintons and their associates in the Whitewater Development Corp. Rosenstein stayed on into the George W. Bush administration and in 2005, Bush appointed him U.S. attorney for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, where he remained through Barack Obama's administration. "He came in under one administration, stayed under another and is now being elevated under yet another," said George Terwilliger III, the former deputy attorney general and acting attorney general under George H.W. Bush. "That tells you everything about the consummate professional that he is." Beneath Rosenstein's mild-mannered demeanor is a tough determination, his current and former colleagues say. As the Baltimore U.S. attorney, for example, Rosenstein successfully prosecuted then-Prince George's County (Maryland) executive Jack Johnson for corruption. President Donald Trump, his administration under siege for contacts with Russian officials, is calling for "an immediate investigation" into Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's own ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's evidence? A 14-year-old photo of Schumer and Putin holding... President Donald Trump, his administration under siege for contacts with Russian officials, is calling for "an immediate investigation" into Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's own ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's evidence? A 14-year-old photo of Schumer and Putin holding... Johnson was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after an investigation in which he was heard on a wiretap ordering his wife, Leslie, to flush a $100,000 check from a developer down the toilet and hide $79,600 in cash in her underwear as FBI agents were knocking on their door with a search warrant. Earlier this week, Rosenstein announced indictments against seven Baltimore police officers in a racketeering conspiracy. Rosenstein is also credited with turning around a troubled U.S. attorney's office. "He's calm, deliberative, analytical and - as they used to say on the kindergarten report card - he works and plays well with others," said former attorney general Michael Mukasey. It was that reputation that led Holder to tap Rosenstein in 2012 to be one of two U.S. attorneys to oversee the investigations into the leaking of classified national security information. The probe resulted in the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. James "Hoss" Cartwright, to plead guilty to one felony count of lying to the FBI. "He ran that investigation effectively, vigorously and without any respect for partisanship," said Robert Litt, former general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration. "After all, he was going after the guy who was reported in the press to be Obama's favorite general at a time when Obama was president." If he is confirmed, Rosenstein - who lives with his wife, an attorney, and two teenage daughters in Bethesda, Maryland - will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the sprawling Justice Department, which has 113,000 employees across the country. The heads of the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will report directly to him. And as of Thursday, he will also take on the oversight of all federal investigations into Russia and the 2016 presidential election.

Contrary to what he told Congress at his confirmation hearing, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions did indeed “have communications with the Russians” when he was a top Trump campaign advisor on national security. But did Sessions commit perjury? Perjury accusations have bedeviled many other Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress in recent decades. It was a central accusation in President Clinton’s impeachment. Prosecutors have also put sports stars and business moguls on trial for perjury. In Sessions’ case, even President Trump conceded that the former Alabama senator “could have stated his response more accurately.” Sessions, the Washington Post reported Wednesday, spoke twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential campaign. Making a false statement, however, is not necessarily perjury. It’s violating an oath to tell the truth by stating something that the person knows to be false. Under federal law, perjury is a felony if the false statement involves anything “material” in a legal matter. It carries a penalty of up to five years in prison — or eight years in terrorism cases. Yes. Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe and some other Trump critics were quick to conclude that Sessions committed perjury. Sessions has denied making any dishonest statements to Congress. He said he intended to state that he did not discuss election matters with the Russians — not that he didn’t speak with them at all. Democrats on Capitol Hill have clamored for Sessions’ resignation, but some of the party’s key lawmakers were still cautious about accusing him of breaking the law. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said Sessions “clearly misled the Senate.” Yes. House Republicans alleged in August that Clinton perjured herself in testimony to Congress on her use of a private email server when she was secretary of State. They argued, among other things, that Clinton stated falsely that she neither sent nor received emails that were marked classified at the time they were transmitted through the private server. FBI Director James B. Comey said it was unclear whether Clinton realized a few of the emails were classified, and he recommended against prosecution. Clinton was never charged with a crime. With his senior staff not yet in place at the Justice Department, the decision on whether to investigate or prosecute Sessions would be up to the acting deputy attorney general, Dana J. Boente, who is also U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Trump put Boente in that job after firing Sally Yates, the Obama administration holdover who refused to defend Trump’s executive order to ban refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The federal law on special prosecutors expired in 1999. But Richard W. Painter, who was associate counsel to President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, said Trump could still name one — a step the president seems unlikely to take. To ensure a special prosecutor is widely perceived as independent, Painter suggested that Trump name a three-judge panel to make the choice. Yes. John N. Mitchell, an attorney general under President Nixon, served 19 months in prison in the 1970s after he was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate scandal. Mitchell’s successor as attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, was charged with making false statements to the Senate at his confirmation hearing. Kleindienst told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he’d never spoken with anyone at the White House about a Justice Department antitrust suit against a big Republican donor, International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. But an Oval Office tape later revealed that Nixon had told Kleindienst to drop the case. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of failing to testify fully. His 30-day jail sentence was suspended. Painter, now a law professor at the University of Minnesota, argues that Sessions’ statement about not communicating with the Russians was essentially the same conduct as Kleindienst’s. Is it mostly people in politics who get prosecuted for perjury? No. Former San Francisco Giants star Barry Bonds was charged with perjury for his testimony before a grand jury investigating illegal steroid distribution. The perjury case ended in a hung jury, and an appeals court overturned Bonds’ felony conviction on a related obstruction of justice charge. Former New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens was acquitted of perjury in 2012 after a trial on charges that he lied to Congress about never using steroids or human growth hormone. Basketball forward Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings was charged with perjury for lying to a grand jury about accepting money from a booster while playing at the University of Michigan. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and did no jail time. Kimberly Jones, the rapper who goes by Lil’ Kim, was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $50,000 for perjury. She was convicted of lying to a grand jury about a 2001 shootout among rival rappers in Manhattan. And lifestyle maven Martha Stewart served five months in prison after she was convicted of perjury and other charges in 2004 for lying to federal law enforcement authorities about a stock sale. michael.finnegan@latimes.com Twitter: @finneganLAT

Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly stonewalled media requests to view public records when he was Indiana's governor, including emails about state business distributed from a private AOL account that was hacked last year. Revelations Pence used the account to discuss homeland security and other official matters, first reported Thursday by the Indianapolis Star, are just the latest in a series of transparency battles involving the Republican's tenure as governor. The Star obtained the AOL emails through an open records request after new Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb agreed to release 29 pages from his predecessor's AOL account. The Associated Press filed a similar records request last July seeking the emails and followed up with a complaint against the governor's office in January when there was no response. Earlier this year, lawyers for Pence argued unsuccessfully in a civil case that Indiana courts had no authority to force him to comply with public records law. His administration also has repeatedly delayed or denied the release of records that could shed light on his tenure as governor. Pence's efforts stand in stark contrast to the image he had previously sought to cultivate, presenting himself as a champion of a free press and the First Amendment. The hacking of Pence's private emails also raises questions of hypocrisy for some of his attacks against Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. He argued Clinton's use of a private server when she was secretary of state could have jeopardized national security if the emails got into the wrong hands. "There's no comparison whatsoever between Hillary Clinton's practice of having a private servers, mishandling classified information, destroying emails when they were requested by the Congress and by officials," Pence said Friday. "We have fully complied with all of Indiana's laws. We had outside counsel review all of my private email records to identify any emails that ever referenced or mentioned state business-related activities. As Indiana laws required we transferred all of those to the state of Indiana subject to the public access laws." Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, have used their private accounts — mpence1314@aol.com and kspence1314@aol.com — to conduct official business dating back to at least 2013, according to separate records obtained by the AP. Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as Indiana's governor, according to public records obtained by the Indianapolis Star.

Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as Indiana's governor, according to public records obtained by the Indianapolis Star. The newspaper reported Thursday that emails provided through a public records request show that Pence communicated with advisers... Richard Painter, former President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, said even if Pence wasn't handling state secrets like Clinton, his use of an AOL account still jeopardizes national security because hacked information could be used as leverage. "The Russians aren't Democrats or Republicans," Painter said. "They would love to find anything they can get on Pence or (President Donald) Trump." Pence's AOL account was subjected to a phishing scheme last spring, before Trump chose him to join the GOP presidential ticket. Pence's contacts were sent an email falsely claiming that the governor and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and needed money. "Those are the very low-level hackers," Painter said. "If that kind of joker can get in, there are Russian hackers that are a lot higher up the food chain." The governor moved to a different AOL account with additional security measures, Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said, but has since stopped using the new personal account since he was sworn-in as vice president. The 29 pages of Pence's AOL emails, which were released to the AP on Friday, show Pence was given FBI updates on arrests made in a terrorism case. They include details about Pence's attempts to bar Syrian Refugees from resettling in Indiana, efforts that were ultimately blocked by a federal judge. In one email, former Pence spokeswoman Kara Brooks told her boss "good job" for conducting himself well in a local TV news story. Holcomb declined to release an unspecified number of additional emails, which he said are confidential. Public officials are not barred from using personal email accounts under Indiana law, but the law is interpreted to mean that any official business conducted on private email must be retained to comply with public record laws. The state requires all records pertaining to state business to be retained and available for public information requests. Emails involving state email accounts are captured on the state's servers, but any emails that Pence may have sent from his AOL account to another private account would need to be retained. At the end of his term, Pence hired the Indianapolis law firm of Barnes & Thornburg to conduct a review of all of his communications and that review is still ongoing, Lotter said. Any correspondence between Pence's AOL account and any aides using a state email account would have been automatically archived, he said.

FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Donald Trump's claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request on Saturday after Trump accused Obama on Twitter of having his "'wires tapped' in Trump Tower." The White House expanded on Trump's comments Sunday with a call for a congressional probe of his allegations. The revelation, first reported by the New York Times, underscores the fraught nature of the FBI's high-profile investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. A key question fueling that inquiry is whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials to help Trump win. Neither Justice nor the FBI would comment Sunday. The development came as Trump's charge against Obama - leveled without any evidence - was being rebuffed both inside and outside of the executive branch. It drew a blunt, on-the-record denial by a top intelligence official who served in the Obama administration. Speaking on NBC News on Sunday morning, former director of national intelligence James Clapper denied that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap was authorized against Trump or the campaign during his tenure. "There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign," Clapper said on "Meet the Press," adding that he would "absolutely" have been informed if the FBI had received a FISA warrant against either. "I can deny it," Clapper said emphatically. In his claims early Saturday morning, the president tweeted that he "just found out" that Obama had "my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower" before the election, comparing it to "McCarthyism." "Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election?" Trump asked in another tweet. "Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!" By Sunday morning, the White House doubled down on Trump's explosive tweetstorm and called for the congressional probe. Current and former government officials said such surveillance would not have been approved by any senior Justice official in the Obama administration. And Trump's allegation raised hackles in the FBI leadership, insinuating as it did that the bureau may have acted illegally to wiretap a presidential candidate without probable cause that he was an "agent of a foreign power," as the foreign intelligence surveillance law requires. "This is Nixon/Watergate," Trump tweeted Saturday. A spokesman for Obama countered several hours later that the former president never authorized a wiretap of Trump or any other American citizen. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply false," the spokesman said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Sunday cited "reports" of "potentially politically motivated investigations" during the 2016 campaign, calling them "troubling." But none of the media reports cited by the White House provides evidence of a politically motivated surveillance effort against Trump. "President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016," Spicer said. "Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted," the statement added. President Donald Trump walks toward Marine One to depart the White House en route to Langley Air Force Base on March 2, 2017, in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump walks toward Marine One to depart the White House en route to Langley Air Force Base on March 2, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Congressional committees in both the House and the Senate are probing not just suspected Russian efforts to undermine the 2016 election but any contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Comey's request is sure to raise eyebrows in light of his actions last year in the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. Last July he held a news conference - without telling the Justice Department what he would say - to announce that the bureau had concluded Clinton did not commit a prosecutable offense. Then, 11 days before the election, Comey wrote Congress despite warnings from senior Justice officials that doing so would violate department policy and said the FBI was examining new emails that had come to light. Nothing came of the bureau's additional review, but Comey took heat for his actions, which Democrats say influenced the outcome of the election. It is not clear why Comey, who is the senior-most law enforcement officer who has been overseeing the FBI investigation from its inception in the Obama administration, did not himself issue a statement to refute Trump's claims. Nor is it clear to whom he made his request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last week from all investigative matters related to the Trump campaign and any potential Russia links. The acting Deputy Attorney General, Dana Boente, a career federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, is now overseeing the probe. Trump's tweets early Saturday may have been prompted by the comments of a conservative radio host, which were summarized in an article on the conservative website Breitbart. The Breitbart story had been circulating among Trump's senior aides on Friday. The White House's escalation of Trump's claims were kept at arm's length by congressional Republicans appearing on Sunday morning news broadcasts. When asked about Trump's allegations, Senate Intelligence Committee member Tom Cotton, R-Ark., declined to comment on the tweets but said he has "seen no evidence of the allegations." "Whether that's a FISA court application or denial of that application or a re-submission of that application, that doesn't mean that none of these things happened. It just means we haven't seen that yet," Cotton added, speaking on Fox News Sunday. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he is not aware of evidence to back up the president's claim. "I have no insight into exactly what he's referring to," he said on "Meet the Press." "The president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer for exactly what he was referring to." Obama's allies were more blunt, denying flatly that the former president had ordered a wiretap of Trump's campaign. "This may come as a surprise to the current occupant of the Oval Office, but the president of the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order the wiretapping of American citizens," said former Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told "Meet the Press" that Trump is "in trouble" and acting "beneath the dignity of the presidency." "How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very... "How low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" -President Donald Trump, tweet, March 4, 2017 "Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations ahead of the 2016 election are very... "The president's in trouble if he falsely spread this kind of information," Schumer said. "It shows this president doesn't know how to conduct himself." Earnest added that Trump was attempting to distract from the controversy involving contacts between his campaign aides, including now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Russian officials. "We know exactly why president Trump tweeted what he tweeted," Earnest added. "Because there is one page in the Trump White House crisis management playbook, and that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal. And the bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet." Trump's tweets early Saturday may have been prompted by the comments of a conservative radio host, which were summarized in an article on the conservative website Breitbart. The Breitbart story had been circulating among Trump's senior aides on Friday. But appearing on ABCs "This Week," White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly said that the president's allegation was worth looking into. "He's asking that we get down to the bottom of this, let's get the truth here, let's find out," Huckabee Sanders said. "I think the bigger story isn't who reported it, but is it true. And I think the American people have a right to know if this happened, because if it did, again, this is the largest abuse of power that, I think, we have ever seen." Asked whether Trump truly believes Obama wiretapped him, Huckabee Sanders deflected. "I would say that his tweet speaks for itself there," she said. Clapper's comments referred only to whether Trump campaign officials had been wiretapped. But their conversations could also have been captured by routine surveillance of Russian diplomats or intelligence operatives. U.S. monitoring of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, for example, caught his conversations with Trump adviser Michael Flynn during the campaign. Flynn went on to become Trump's national security adviser, but he was forced to resign last month after admitting that he had misled other senior Trump officials about the nature of those conversations. The FBI and the National Security Agency also have obtained intercepted communications among Russians officials in which they refer to conversations with members of the Trump team, current and former U.S. officials have said. On the broader question of apparent Russian interference in the 2016 election, Clapper urged congressional investigators to attempt to settle the issue, which he said has become a "distraction" in the political sphere. The intelligence community found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government - at least until the end of the Obama administration, he said Sunday. "We had no evidence of such collusion," he said on "Meet the Press." But Clapper added a caveat: "This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left government." Whether there was any collusion is a key question fueling a wide-ranging federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Jan. 6, the U.S. spy agencies collectively released a report concluding that Russia carried out cyberhacks and other "active measures" with an intent to help Trump and harm the campaign and potential presidency of Hillary Clinton. The report, Clapper pointed out, included "no evidence" of collusion with the Trump campaign. But the investigation by the FBI, the NSA and the CIA continues. The Senate and House intelligence committees also are conducting investigations.

The leaders of a congressional inquiry into Russia's efforts to sway the U.S. election called on the Justice Department Wednesday to produce any evidence that supports President Donald Trump's explosive wiretapping allegation. Declaring that Congress "must get to the bottom" of Trump's claim, Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente and FBI Director James Comey to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department's criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps. Trump tweeted last weekend that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones at Trump Tower during the election. But Trump offered no evidence to back up the accusation. Through a spokesman, Obama said neither he nor any White House official had ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said nothing matching Trump's claims had taken place. Following Trump's tweet, FBI Director James Comey privately asked the Justice Department to dispute the president's claim because he believed the allegations to be false. As the chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary crime and terrorism subcommittee, Graham and Whitehouse said they would take very seriously "any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political reasons." But, they added, "We would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower." President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a "Nixon/Watergate" plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters in the run-up to last fall's election, providing no evidence to support his explosive claim and drawing a flat denial from...

The senators are seeking warrant applications and court orders, which they said can be scrubbed to protect secret intelligence sources and methods. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told Iowa reporters in a Wednesday telephone call that he needs to be able to "sort fact from fiction" before making any decisions about Trump's wiretapping allegation. Grassley also said he's waiting to receive a briefing from Comey, who told the senator earlier this week that he's awaiting clearance from the Justice Department. The House and Senate Intelligence committees, and the FBI, are investigating contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian officials, as well as whether Moscow tried to influence the 2016 election. Trump demanded that they broaden the scope of their inquiries to include Obama's potential abuse of executive powers.

Comey made the request... The ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, Sen. Mark Warner, spent a couple hours Wednesday at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., reviewing material for the committee's investigation into Russia's meddling in the election and possible contacts that Trump associates had with Russians. Other committee members, including Sens. Angus King, I-Maine, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also went to the CIA to read material Wednesday. Staffers on the House intelligence committee have been making trips there too to look at documents for their parallel investigation. Asked if he learned anything that might alter direction of the investigation, Warner said: "Some of the things begged more questions." Graham and Whitehouse acknowledged Trump's desire for the intelligence committees to have purview, but they argued that their subcommittee has oversight of the Justice Department's criminal division. Graham has been a frequent critic of Trump's push for closer ties with Moscow. After Trump's victory in November, he pledged to use his position in the Republican majority to investigate what he called "Russia's misadventures throughout the world."

The director of the federal government's ethics agency Tuesday blasted President-elect Donald Trump's plan to maintain his business empire by turning it over to his sons instead of selling off all his corporate assets and placing remaining profits in a government-approved blind trust. U.S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub took the rare step Tuesday of commenting publicly about a presidential ethics decision, warning that Trump's solution to a potential cascade of conflicts spurred by his global business holdings breaks 40 years of precedent by presidents from both parties. Shaub, a 2013 Obama appointee who also worked at the agency during the George W. Bush administration, openly pleaded with Trump to reconsider his plan before his inauguration. Shaub said Trump should commit to "divestiture," a process under which he would sell his corporate assets and place the profit in a blind trust administered by a neutral trustee approved by the OGE. Emails between the OGE and the Trump transition team obtained by the Associated Press show that Shaub repeatedly tried to engage with Trump's aides late last year to persuade the president-elect and his Cabinet choices to agree to divestiture as the cleanest way to clear aware potential ethics conflicts posed by their investments and businesses. But while lawyers for several Trump picks, including prospective Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and senior adviser Jared Kushner, have worked closely with the OGE in shaping divestiture plans, Trump's own lawyers and aides gave the federal agency no official advance notice of his plan to turn over his global empire to his sons, according to an official familiar with interactions between the two sides. The official, who requested anonymity to detail the sensitive contacts between the two sides, said that Shaub met once with Trump's prospective White House counsel, Don McGahn, in recent weeks, but only to discuss ethics plans for several of Trump's picks, not for Trump's own plan to deal with his holdings. President-elect Donald Trump, under fire for his business conflicts, said Wednesday that he will turn his company over to his sons — but he won’t sell his network of properties and deals. Trump will create a trust and turn it over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric along with another business executive,... President-elect Donald Trump, under fire for his business conflicts, said Wednesday that he will turn his company over to his sons — but he won’t sell his network of properties and deals. Trump will create a trust and turn it over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric along with another business executive,... An outside attorney for Trump, Sheri Dillon of firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius, said Tuesday that Trump plans to have his companies' operations directed by his two sons, but they would pursue new deals only in the U.S., not abroad. Additionally, Dillon said, Trump would put his business assets in a trust but would hand over management of his international real estate firms to a management company based in New York. Shaub said during a rare appearance at the Brookings Institution that he was "especially troubled" by Dillon's comment that Trump's liquid assets from stock and investment sales he made in recent months before the presidential election would be placed in a "diversified portfolio of assets" approved by the OGE. "No one has ever talked to us about the idea, and there's no legal mechanism to do that," Shaub said. He added that the only OGE-approved method is the government-qualified blind trust set by the Ethics in Government Act. Shaub said his agency's unusual Twitter comments last year complimenting Trump for considering divesting his assets was his decision, made to "use the vernacular of the president-elect's favorite social media platform to encourage him to divest." Shaub said he now worries that Trump has no intention to go through government-approved divestiture, a move that risks "creating the perception that government leaders would use their official positions for profit." Shaub said he had been initially encouraged by a Trump tweet last year that "no way" would he allow any conflicts of interest. "Unfortunately," Shaub said, "his current plan cannot achieve that goal." Associated Press

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that his health care proposal must change to pass the House, marking a significant retreat from his earlier position that the carefully crafted legislation would fail if altered. The shift came after a private meeting of House Republicans from which Ryan, R-Wis., emerged to tell reporters that his proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would "incorporate feedback" from the rank-and-file. Ryan attributed the change of strategy to the impact of an analysis issued Monday by the Congressional Budget Office. Among other details that prompted a fresh round of criticism of the proposal was a projection that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured after one year under the Republican plan. Ryan backed away on Wednesday from his previous rhetoric of calling the measure's fate a "binary choice" for Republican lawmakers. "Now that we have our score ... we can make some necessary improvements and refinements to the bill," he said, referring to the CBO's estimate of the impact on the number of those covered by health insurance and what the GOP proposal would cost. Ryan did not detail what changes are under consideration. Vice President Pence also spoke to House Republicans in the meeting, acknowledging that changes to the legislation - which heads to the House Budget Committee for approval Thursday - are in the works. President Trump has offered his support for Ryan's measure, while still meeting with conservative lawmakers who have expressed serious doubts about the plan. "This president is ready to put the full weight of his bully pulpit and all of his tools" behind the bill, Pence told Republicans, according to Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. "It was very important for us to hear that, because there are a lot of people who need that shoring up." A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... Pence told conservatives that the plan was still under negotiation at a private lunch meeting of the Republican Study Committee, a large caucus of conservative House Republicans, according to several attendees. "As he said, it's not often that we get an opportunity to undo such a big piece of legislation that had negative consequences on the American people," said Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., paraphrasing Pence's message. "He's open to make improvements. ... Anything that can get 218 votes and make the bill better, we're all about it." Pence's visit to Capitol Hill - which included meetings with influential blocs of Republicans, as well as individual members - came as part of a White House effort to salvage support for the embattled American Health Care Act, even as President Donald Trump's conservative allies told him the bill could be a political trap. The legislation will face an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee meets to consider the legislation and advance it to the House floor. The committee may not directly amend the bill but may make nonbinding recommendations. Any substantive changes would be made by the House Rules Committee, which controls how the bill is presented and debated on the floor.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., insisted that GOP leaders are not "dug in" when it comes to concerns about the measure. "We're listening; we're definitely listening," she said Wednesday to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. "And I will tell you: Tune in to our Budget Committee tomorrow, and you will hear these conversations." The blitz came two days after the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured next year under the GOP plan. The falling coverage numbers and estimates of higher premiums for older and low-income Americans raised concerns among many lawmakers, particularly those representing states that expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA. Ryan, R-Wis., plans to hold a House floor vote next week, and Trump administration officials have spent the last two days in near-constant discussion with Republican lawmakers as they scramble to find enough votes to pass the measure. Leaders were set to take a preliminary count of members supporting the bill Wednesday night. Critics of the legislation warned Wednesday that the measure remains far short of the 216 votes needed for passage. Typically, 218 votes are needed to pass a bill in the 435-member House, but five pending vacancies have reduced that threshold. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, and with 237 Republicans, party leaders can afford no more than 21 defections. "They will whip it, and they will find 40 nos and another 30 or 40 undecideds," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who has called for changes to mollify conservatives. One member of the Budget Committee who belongs to the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said he will vote against the bill in committee. Two other Freedom Caucus members, as well as three others on the panel, have not said how they will vote. One conservative Budget Committee member who has voiced concerns about the bill said Wednesday that he had been convinced to advance it. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., said he would support the legislation in the panel based on an "implied promise that things are going to be different on the floor, and therefore we can keep the process moving." He declined to say who had made that promise: "People higher up on the food chain than me." "I'll say this, if the bill that comes to the floor is the exact same one in Budget, I'll feel a little bit that I'd been had," he said. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., acknowledged in an MSNBC interview Wednesday that the bill remains under negotiation. "Watching sausage being made is not the prettiest thing," he said. "What can we do on those final pieces that are being negotiated with President Trump and a number of our members in our conference that ultimately want to get to a yes vote and send this bill over to the Senate?" Ryan spent much of Tuesday and Wednesday giving interviews in an attempt to drum up support for the plan. On the Fox Business Network, he defended the plan as a collaboration with Trump and the Senate and said "the major components are staying intact" while opening the door to "refinements and improvements." Later, in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, he countered reports that the White House's support for the bill might be slipping. Ryan said he had spoken to chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump's chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon "a number of times" about the bill, and he noted that Trump had brought lawmakers to the White House multiple times to make the case for the legislation. "We are on the same page as the White House," Ryan said. "I think there are those who would love to wedge us for one reason or another, but that's just not the case." Hours later, at a rally for Obamacare opponents outside the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told activists that the House plan "has a lot of problems" but could possibly be modified into a "real repeal" of the ACA. "I believe we can get it done," Cruz said. "I can tell you, the last week, four days, I've been at the White House meeting with the president, with the vice president, saying, 'We've got to get it done.'" Various changes have been floated since the bill was unveiled earlier this month. Conservatives have pushed for an earlier phase-out of the ACA's Medicaid expansion, moving it from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2018, but GOP moderates in both the House and Senate have pushed back on that notion. "Doing that would be a nonstarter and would be enormously and hugely problematic for many of our members," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. Meadows said Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus is closely focused on repealing more of the ACA's mandates governing the extent of insurance coverage. "That is probably the No. 1 priority," he said. "If we can get those, it would make the rest of it a whole lot easier." GOP leaders, however, have kept those provisions out of the pending legislation, arguing that their inclusion could threaten the bill's passage in the Senate and that many of those mandates can be undone through Trump administration actions. In another sign of the effect of the CBO report, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., floated a proposal to recalibrate the tax credits established under the House bill to offer more substantial help to low-income Americans. The House bill would offer assistance to individuals making as much as $115,000 a year; Thune's amendment would phase out aid for those making about $75,000 or more. "We want to build on what the House has done, and we think that this amendment does that," Thune said. "It just makes it more defensible both in terms of the policy implications and the politics."

But widespread dissatisfaction among House and Senate lawmakers - conservatives and moderates alike - showed no signs of dissipating, increasing the chances that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will have difficulty passing the bill if it goes to the House floor in the next two weeks, not to mention whether it can collect a majority in the Senate. "I have serious concerns about the current draft of the House bill," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview Tuesday. "As written, I do not believe the House bill would pass the Senate." House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... The White House is putting its political capital behind the Ryan proposal, however, sending emissaries to the Hill and meeting with skeptical lawmakers - including Cruz, who went to the White House on Tuesday along with a small group of fellow conservatives. Trump has enthusiastically backed the GOP plan invarious statements and tweets, and its failure - or the failure of a similar measure - would probably tarnish his promise to replace Obamacare with a better system. The president also planned to speak about health care with Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by phoneTuesday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., attempted to play down the severity of the GOP split after a closed-door party lunch attended by Pence, Price and some of the architects of the House bill, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Following the lunch, McConnell tried to shift the focus from the coverage numbers to more favorable terrain for Republicans: the CBO's projection that Ryan's plan would reduce the federal budget deficit over the next decade and produce a 10 percent average decrease in premiums after that. "Regarding the projection of fewer people purchasing, I think that's the inevitable result of the government not making you purchase something you may not want," McConnell told reporters. "And so we are hoping to have a more vibrant market that will attract a greater number of people to actually be able to buy, at an affordable cost, insurance that actually makes sense for them rather than one prescribed by the government." Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who is normally chatty with reporters, was more guarded than usual coming out of the meeting. He declined to discuss specifics but said House leaders and the White House were making a good-faith effort to hear the concerns of Republican senators. "They really are taking input. So I don't think they would be over here unless they really do want to take input from folks," Corker said. The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare."

The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The GOP legislation faces an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee will meet to combine pieces passed by separate committees into a single bill and advance it to the House floor. The budget panel cannot make substantive changes to the bill, but it can make nonbinding recommendations before it goes to the floor for a final vote. Several members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, which has expressed serious concerns that the measure does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare, are on the Budget Committee and could decline to support the bill there. Republicans hold an eight-vote advantage over Democrats on the Budget Committee, and if four GOP members oppose it, the bill could stall. Three of the 22 Republicans on the panel are members of the House Freedom Caucus. Aides to those three members - Reps. Dave Brat, Va., Gary Palmer, Ala., and Mark Sanford, S.C., - did not respond to inquiries Tuesday about whether they intended to support the legislation in committee. Three other Budget Committee Republicans, Reps. John Faso, N.Y., Mario Diaz-Balart, Fla., and Bruce Westerman, Ark., said Tuesday that they were undecided on their committee votes. Near the close of the Tuesday Senate lunches, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the head of the Freedom Caucus, was seen walking down a hallway near the room where the lunch was held. "We've got some work to do, still," said Meadows, adding that he had received "no assurances" from the White House or anyone else about changes to the bill that would attract his support. Among the commitments that White House staff members have pledged to support is a series of amendments at the budget panel this week, according to one senior White House official. But special budget rules established more than four decades ago make that plan impossible to fulfill. Budget Committee members do not have the authority to offer any substantive or binding amendments to the legislation. The committee's sole job is to combine the recommendations of previous committees - which have passed the GOP proposal - and send the legislation to the House Rules Committee. Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for... Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., said Tuesday that she is in talks with her members about potential "motions" to ask the Rules Committee to modify the bill when it takes it up, probably early next week. "Really our role and responsibility is to take the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce bills and put them together," Black said in an interview. Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., the Budget Committee's vice chairman, said Tuesday that while the panel cannot directly make changes to the bill, members can suggest recommendations. "I think that is fair game if you're trying to be an honest broker and better the bill, and I think we should welcome that kind of discussion," he said. "If you're doing it because you want to sabotage the bill, you're going to find guys like me swat that down pretty vehemently." Rokita said he has attempted to persuade the bill's skeptics by asking: "Do they not have the courage to do the big thing? And that's how I'm framing it with them." The House Republicans' legislation would keep a few of the ACA's most popular features, such as forbidding insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting medical problems, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. The plan would erase penalties the ACA imposes on people who do not buy health coverage and, instead, would have a deterrent: a 30 percent surcharge on premiums that insurers could levy for a year if consumers let their coverage lapse. The bill would remove the ACA's subsidies, replacing them with generally smaller tax credits available to people with somewhat higher incomes, and it would give more help to younger adults than older ones. The tax credits could be used for any plan sold in a state as long as it didn't provide coverage for abortion. The legislation would gradually eliminate an expansion of Medicaid, the public insurance program for lower-income Americans, that was accepted by 31 states under the ACA and would give states an annual fixed sum based on the number of people in the program. The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... Moderate Republicans from states that expanded Medicaid have voiced concerns that the bill would not do enough to protect those who obtained coverage through that expansion. They worry that the projected deficit reduction would not be enough of a benefit to compensate for the number of people who stand to lose coverage. "These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday of the CBO report. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.,, a physician and strong ACA critic, sounded apprehensive about the CBO report's implications. "President Trump said that he wants as many people covered as under Obamacare," Cassidy said Monday. "He said that health care should be affordable. If there's 14 million people losing insurance, of course it's concerning." On the right, conservatives have complained that the bill is not a forceful enough rollback of the Obama administration's health-care law. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Cruz, hasbeen a chief conservative critic of the law. "There is a solution for House Leaders that conservatives have offered: abandon Obamacare Lite now," Paul wrote Tuesday on Twitter. "It is bad law & it can't pass." In a later tweet, he added: "If House leaders try do a little less using the same basic framework as the failed Obamacare experiment, then it will fail too." Lee also raised concerns in an editorial for the conservative Daily Signal that the House bill contains policy changes that would violate strict Senate rules. One such worry involves a provision that would forbid the use of insurance tax credits for coverage of health-care providers that offer abortion services. But moderates warned that addressing the conservatives' concerns would threaten their own support. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Leonard Lance, R-N.J., said Tuesday that they would oppose the bill, while Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., - a leader of the moderate GOP faction - said he has "serious concerns and reservations" about supporting the measure without changes. The Washington Post's Amy Goldstein, Abby Phillip, David Weigel and James Hohmann contributed to this report.

A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing talk radio, as well as among friends who have Trump's ear, the message has been blunt: The plan is being advanced by congressional Republican leaders is deeply flawed - and, at worst, a political trap. Trump's allies worry that he is jeopardizing his presidency by promoting the bill spearheaded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wis., arguing that it would fracture Trump's coalition of working- and middle-class voters, many of them older and subsisting on federal aid. Vice President Mike Pence and administration officials scrambled Tuesday to salvage the plan amid widespread dissatisfaction in both the Senate and House over the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that 24 million fewer people would be insured in a decade under the Ryan proposal, titled the American Health Care Act. The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... Trump - who has not yet fully used the bully pulpit of the presidency to rally support for the plan - spoke privately with Ryan on Tuesday afternoon. They discussed the various factions, the opinions of several key members and developing a closing strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the call. Trump loyalists warned that the president was at risk of violating some of his biggest campaign promises - such as providing broad health coverage for all Americans and preserving Medicaid and other entitlement programs - in service to an ideological project championed for years by Ryan and other establishment Republicans. "Trump figures things out pretty quickly and I think he's figuring out this situation, how the House Republicans did him a disservice," said Christopher Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. "President Trump is a big-picture, pragmatic Republican, and unfortunately the Ryan Republican plan doesn't capture his worldview." Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media, published a column Tuesday urging Trump to "ditch" the current bill. Inside the White House, senior officials said they are taking note of the mounting opposition. "You can't be so blind that you're not seeing the outside noise," said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to speak publicly. A second adviser, who also requested anonymity to speak candidly, said, "We take their views seriously and we're listening, but we do appreciate when those concerns are shared privately and with a smaller megaphone." Keeping Republicans on edge are several Trump advisers with tenuous ties to Ryan and the party establishment who might be more responsive than others to outside pressure, including chief strategist Stephen Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare."

The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare." The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The White House strategy has been to spotlight what it sees as the urgent need to overhaul the health-care system rather than the legislative fix itself. At his Tuesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer highlighted "real life examples" of "actual Americans" who shared with Trump stories of suffering in a listening session Monday. "These are the stories that are at the top of the president's mind as he works towards reforming our health-care system," Spicer said. This fresh public agitation from Trump loyalists comes as hard-line Republicans in Congress already stand opposed to the health-care bill. These lawmakers, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, see the proposal as insufficiently conservative because it is too reliant on tax credits and does not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, the law often known as Obamacare that was signed by President Barack Obama. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the president should not be tempted by outside calls to abandon the Ryan bill and should instead "let the legislative process work." "What's happening now is a gut check," he said. "It's not unusual. People are figuring out what they're going to stand tight on." The cascade of opposition within Trump's movement started flowing soon after the bill was unveiled last week and picked up speed this week. On Breitbart - the anti-establishment, conservative news site that has been a platform for Trumpism and was once run by Bannon - article after article has railed against a bill its headline writers excoriate as "RyanCare." One heavily promoted story said that RyanCare was "a perverse economic system," featuring an interview with Rep. David Brat, R-Va., a tea-party hero who unseated then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014. House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... Breitbart published leaked audio of Ryan on Monday that could undermine his relationship with Trump. The recording is of Ryan on a conference call with House Republicans last year, immediately following the release of the "Access Hollywood" video in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Ryan said on the call that he was "not going to defend Donald Trump - not now, not in the future." Breitbart also has been promoting a rally Wednesday on Capitol Hill organized by FreedomWorks, a right-wing advocacy group that stoked the tea-party movement. The event will feature Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas, Mike Lee, Utah, and Rand Paul, Ky., who oppose Ryan's health-care bill. Paul told reporters Tuesday that the plan was losing momentum: "There's not really any kind of coalition that's going to get the Ryan bill to pass. I think the CBO score makes it harder for him to pass his bill, and he's losing the argument." The rush by Ryan to quickly pass the health-care bill concerns some of Trump's top supporters, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. "I don't think Americans care whether this bill passes by Easter or Memorial Day," Cotton said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. Republican strategist John Brabender said he observed a number of focus groups of Trump voters in Rust Belt states and found them willing to be patient about the timetable for overhauling health care. Brabender said the White House "should take a deep breath and not feel like anybody has to rush out and sign something they don't feel good about. ... They have to be careful not to just quickly check a box and then own something around their neck for years." Cotton dismissed promises from Trump and Republican congressional leaders of an evolving, multiphase process that would continue throughout the year. "There is no three-phase process," Cotton said on Hewitt's show. "There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk. It's just politicians engaging in spin." At the White House, Spicer was confronted at his briefing about Cotton's criticism as an example of the administration lacking control over what its own supporters are saying. "It's a free country," Spicer said. "He can say what he wants."

The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... Rush Limbaugh echoed Cotton's concerns on his airwaves Tuesday. The conservative talk-radio commentator said the message from congressional leaders is: "We gotta pass the bill. We gotta send it up to president. No matter what's in it, we gotta pass the bill." "Passing the bill becomes the measure of success," he continued, "and so that's when the real dangerous horse-trading begins." Limbaugh has sounded protective of Trump, explaining on his show last Friday that the president's supporters should give him time to work out a better deal because he is "inside the sausage factory" for only the first time. "Trump is probably finding out just how deeply intertwined the tentacles of this are throughout our society, and what happens when you remove one tentacle?" he asked. "You find six more pop up that you didn't know were there." Fox News host Eric Bolling, who once considered joining the Trump administration and is friendly with the president, published an op-ed Tuesday on the network's website that said Ryan and the "establishment GOP have pulled a fast one on President Trump." "It's time for President Trump to scrap the GOP health-care bill," Bolling wrote. Conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham, a friend of Trump's who was considered for a job in the White House, said Tuesday on Fox News that the Ryan bill is a "trap." "I think Donald Trump is going to get caught on this in 2020," she said, referring to the president's reelection. "I'd like to spend an hour talking to him about it. I think this is a trap set for Trump, and it's going to be bad." Former senator Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who was a key player in the battle over the Affordable Care Act in 2010, said of the current situation: "The Republicans are in an impossible position." "Most of the people who are in opposition to this have never governed, don't know how to govern and don't want to govern," Gregg said. "Unfortunately, Republicans now control the government and have to learn how to govern. The Laura Ingrahams of the world, who make their money agitating, aren't functional in a situation where the president has to govern." The Washington Post's David Weigel contributed to this report.

The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured next year under the GOP plan, Vice Mike President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price went to Capitol Hill to rally backing for the proposal. But widespread dissatisfaction among House and Senate lawmakers - conservatives and moderates alike - showed no signs of dissipating, increasing the chances that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will have difficulty passing the bill if it goes to the House floor in the next two weeks, not to mention whether it can collect a majority in the Senate. "I have serious concerns about the current draft of the House bill," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview Tuesday. "As written, I do not believe the House bill would pass the Senate."

So I don't think they would be over here unless they really do want to take input from folks," Corker said. The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare."

The White House shifted away from President Trump's stated goal of providing "insurance for everybody" on Tuesday, instead promising that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare offers "more people the option to get healthcare." The altered tone from Press Secretary Sean Spicer comes... The GOP legislation faces an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee will meet to combine pieces passed by separate committees into a single bill and advance it to the House floor. The budget panel cannot make substantive changes to the bill, but it can make nonbinding recommendations before it goes to the floor for a final vote. Several members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, which has expressed serious concerns that the measure does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare, are on the Budget Committee and could decline to support the bill there. Republicans hold an eight-vote advantage over Democrats on the Budget Committee, and if four GOP members oppose it, the bill could stall. Three of the 22 Republicans on the panel are members of the House Freedom Caucus. Aides to those three members - Reps. Dave Brat, Va., Gary Palmer, Ala., and Mark Sanford, S.C., - did not respond to inquiries Tuesday about whether they intended to support the legislation in committee. Three other Budget Committee Republicans, Reps. John Faso, N.Y., Mario Diaz-Balart, Fla., and Bruce Westerman, Ark., said Tuesday that they were undecided on their committee votes. Near the close of the Tuesday Senate lunches, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the head of the Freedom Caucus, was seen walking down a hallway near the room where the lunch was held. "We've got some work to do, still," said Meadows, adding that he had received "no assurances" from the White House or anyone else about changes to the bill that would attract his support. Among the commitments that White House staff members have pledged to support is a series of amendments at the budget panel this week, according to one senior White House official. But special budget rules established more than four decades ago make that plan impossible to fulfill. Budget Committee members do not have the authority to offer any substantive or binding amendments to the legislation. The committee's sole job is to combine the recommendations of previous committees - which have passed the GOP proposal - and send the legislation to the House Rules Committee. Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade.

Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., said Tuesday that she is in talks with her members about potential "motions" to ask the Rules Committee to modify the bill when it takes it up, probably early next week. "Really our role and responsibility is to take the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce bills and put them together," Black said in an interview. Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., the Budget Committee's vice chairman, said Tuesday that while the panel cannot directly make changes to the bill, members can suggest recommendations. "I think that is fair game if you're trying to be an honest broker and better the bill, and I think we should welcome that kind of discussion," he said. "If you're doing it because you want to sabotage the bill, you're going to find guys like me swat that down pretty vehemently." Rokita said he has attempted to persuade the bill's skeptics by asking: "Do they not have the courage to do the big thing? And that's how I'm framing it with them." The House Republicans' legislation would keep a few of the ACA's most popular features, such as forbidding insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting medical problems, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. The plan would erase penalties the ACA imposes on people who do not buy health coverage and, instead, would have a deterrent: a 30 percent surcharge on premiums that insurers could levy for a year if consumers let their coverage lapse. The bill would remove the ACA's subsidies, replacing them with generally smaller tax credits available to people with somewhat higher incomes, and it would give more help to younger adults than older ones. The tax credits could be used for any plan sold in a state as long as it didn't provide coverage for abortion. The legislation would gradually eliminate an expansion of Medicaid, the public insurance program for lower-income Americans, that was accepted by 31 states under the ACA and would give states an annual fixed sum based on the number of people in the program. The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count.

The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance... Moderate Republicans from states that expanded Medicaid have voiced concerns that the bill would not do enough to protect those who obtained coverage through that expansion. They worry that the projected deficit reduction would not be enough of a benefit to compensate for the number of people who stand to lose coverage. "These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday of the CBO report. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.,, a physician and strong ACA critic, sounded apprehensive about the CBO report's implications. "President Trump said that he wants as many people covered as under Obamacare," Cassidy said Monday. "He said that health care should be affordable. If there's 14 million people losing insurance, of course it's concerning." On the right, conservatives have complained that the bill is not a forceful enough rollback of the Obama administration's health-care law. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., along with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Cruz, hasbeen a chief conservative critic of the law. "There is a solution for House Leaders that conservatives have offered: abandon Obamacare Lite now," Paul wrote Tuesday on Twitter. "It is bad law & it can't pass." In a later tweet, he added: "If House leaders try do a little less using the same basic framework as the failed Obamacare experiment, then it will fail too." Lee also raised concerns in an editorial for the conservative Daily Signal that the House bill contains policy changes that would violate strict Senate rules. One such worry involves a provision that would forbid the use of insurance tax credits for coverage of health-care providers that offer abortion services. But moderates warned that addressing the conservatives' concerns would threaten their own support. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Leonard Lance, R-N.J., said Tuesday that they would oppose the bill, while Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., - a leader of the moderate GOP faction - said he has "serious concerns and reservations" about supporting the measure without changes. The Washington Post's Amy Goldstein, Abby Phillip, David Weigel and James Hohmann contributed to this report.

The Congressional Budget Office is out with its much-awaited report on the projected impact of Republicans' Obamacare replacement, and it's decidedly bad news for the GOP - at least on one very important count. While some early estimates suggested that 6 to 15 million could lose their insurance under the GOP's plan - a healthy portion of the 20 million who gained it under Obamacare - the projections are far north of that. In fact, they suggest that more people would eventually lose their insurance than have gained it. The CBO says 14 million would lose their insurance in 2018, that 21 million would lose it in 2020 and that 24 million would lose it in 2026. Then the CBO report includes this line: "In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law." That's nearly double. Republicans, sensing this day was coming, have spent the better part of the past week arguing that the CBO score doesn't matter, that it's historically been a poor estimate, and even that it's merely a "beauty contest," as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., put it Friday. But it's one thing to make that case; it's another to make just about every Republican senator believe it, as Ryan and President Donald Trump need to. And it's yet another to get skeptical House Republicans to vote for a bill they know could be dead on arrival in the Senate, where Republicans have just 52 votes. Perhaps the one big saving grace for the GOP in the CBO report is that it says the law will reduce the deficit over the long term - $337 billion over a decade. That's no small number. And as Ryan notes in his statement, the report also says premiums will begin to drop in 2020. "This report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums and improve access to quality, affordable care," Ryan said. House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection,... But in order to reap those benefits, Republicans will confront the very real possibility of more than 20 million people becoming uninsured. And one very important group isn't likely to benefit from those reduced premium costs, according to the report: old people. "Under the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for older enrollees than younger ones rather than three times more as under current law, substantially reducing premiums for young adults and substantially raising premiums for older people," it says. "Substantially raising premiums for older people" - as in, the people who are much more likely to vote. Strike two. From here, the goal of Ryan and other GOP leaders is basically to convince already-skeptical Republicans that the big "24 million" figure is pie in the sky - not a real number and nowhere close to where it will be in reality. It simply cannot be. And Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price set about that task shortly after the CBO report came out. "We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out," Price said. "It's virtually impossible to have that number occur. ... It's just not believable." But there is very, very little margin for error on that front. From the start, four Republican senators said they will not vote for a bill that decreases the insurance rate by millions, and another senator - Dean Heller of Nevada - over the weekend suggested that getting rid of the Medicaid expansion was a non-starter in his state. Keeping 50 out of 52 senators onboard - when 13 of them were already skeptical, according to The Post's whip count - will be immensely difficult. And that's if the bill can even get out of the House, which is hardly a guarantee at this point.

Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for the legislation backed by President Donald Trump even tougher, with a few House and Senate conservatives already in open revolt and moderate Republicans queasy about big cuts to the Medicaid safety net for the poor. But with the legislation headed for votes in the House Budget Committee within days and floor action next week, its supporters at the White House and on Capitol Hill showed no sign of retreat. Instead, they attacked the parts of the CBO report they didn't like, while touting the more favorable findings, including smaller deficits from their bill and lower premiums over time. "I'm pretty encouraged by it, it actually exceeded my expectations," House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said on Fox News Channel shortly after the report was released Monday evening. Ryan said the CBO findings about millions losing coverage were to be expected, because the GOP legislation removes the penalty in former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act aimed at coercing people into buying coverage. "If we're not going to force someone to buy something they don't want to buy they're not going to buy it, and that's kind of obvious," Ryan said. The GOP legislation would use tax credits to help consumers buy health coverage, expand health savings accounts, phase out an expansion of Medicaid and cap that program for the future, end some requirements for health plans under Obama's law, and scrap a number of taxes. Ryan pointed to other CBO figures, including that the GOP bill reduces federal deficits by $337 billion over a decade, and begins to bring down insurance premiums by around 10 percent starting in 2020, though that comes only after premiums sharply rise in 2018 and 2019. Democrats scoffed at Ryan's positive take, calling the CBO analysis damning evidence that Republicans are interested only in giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the rich, which their bill would accomplish, while yanking health coverage from the poor. "I hope they would pull the bill. It's really the only decent thing to do," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said. "How can they look their constituents in the eye when they say to them '24 million of you will no longer have coverage.'" Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Senate’s top Democrat, said the CBO report should be a "knockout blow” for the legislation. At the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price rejected portions of the CBO's findings, in comments that seemed to contradict Speaker Ryan. "We believe that the plan that we're putting in place is going to insure more individuals than currently are insured. So we think the CBO simply has it wrong," Price said It was unclear exactly what impact the CBO news would have on the debate. Republicans were already planning to move forward with no Democratic votes, aiming for action by the full House next week and the Senate the week after that. Senate prospects look particularly dicey, given the GOP's slim 52-48 majority and vociferous objections from several Republicans including Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senators were just beginning to absorb the CBO findings Monday night. The approaching winter storm had delayed the arrival of House members to the Capitol. "It's awful. It has to be a concern," Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said of the budget office findings. "President Trump said he wanted as many people covered as under Obamacare." "At the end of the day, we should pause and try to improve the product in light of the CBO analysis rather than just rejecting it," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Price planned to meet with GOP senators Tuesday to discuss the issue. All along Republican leaders have assumed that once it comes time to vote, few if any Republicans will dare vote "no" on the repeal and replacement of "Obamacare" that their party has been promising for seven years. They are relying on Trump's popularity with conservative voters to close the deal, and Trump on Monday announced he would be traveling to Kentucky for a rally early next week. But the Congressional Budget report seemed likely to increase some Republicans' discomfort with their approach, especially those representing states that expanded Medicaid coverage under Obama's law. Roughly 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage over a decade as the GOP bill cuts $880 billion from the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled, the CBO said. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, but the bill would violate that pledge, as well as fail to meet Trump's stated goal of "insurance for everybody." The CBO report also undercuts a central argument that Trump and other Republicans have cited for swiftly rolling back Obama's health care overhaul: that the health insurance markets created under the 2010 law are unstable and about to implode. The congressional experts said that largely would not be the case and the market for individual health insurance policies "would probably be stable in most areas either under current law or the (GOP) legislation."

Republicans' new health-care bill is a mass transfer of wealth that cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while cutting federal benefits for the middle and working class. Just two provisions in the Republican plan would allow the richest households to pay an average of nearly $200,000 less under the Republican plan, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. For the lower-middle class, the plan would replace the current system of benefits based on income with a new system based on age. As a result, a young person making less money would get less help to buy insurance than an older person who is making more. The GOP measure unwinds many of the provisions of Obamacare, which offered health insurance subsidies to millions of middle-income households and funded them in part through new taxes on the wealthy. Republican proponents of the bill argue that by eliminating regulations on health insurance, their legislation will reduce the price of coverage for the middle class, making up for the financial pain of reduced government support. Some experts, however, are skeptical that the plan will work as intended. "If the plan is successful in theory at lowering health insurance premiums, that's particularly a powerful economic benefit for low income people who struggle to afford health insurance," said Avik Roy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... But Roy added that those benefits will not make up for the reduced subsidies: "The regulatory changes are a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, they don't go far enough," he said. "That's going to cause problems for a number of people." - For the rich Wealthy Americans -- especially those households with incomes above $200,000 -- would be better off under the bill primarily because they would no longer pay two major taxes levied as part of the Affordable Care Act. One is a tax of 0.9 percent on taxpayers earning more than $200,000 in wages and salaries a year, or $250,000 for married couples. Those households must also pay a surcharge of 3.8 percent on income from several kinds of investments. Together, these taxes are projected to raise $346 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... The taxes aren't limited to the wealthy, but the wealthy would get the lion's share of the benefits of their repeal. The richest percentile of families pay 77 percent of the tax on high wages and salaries, and 90 percent of the tax on investments, according to the Tax Policy Center. And the very rich would fare even better. The center projects that the average household from the top 0.1 percent of income distribution would save $31,000 a year if the tax on high salaries were repealed, and another $165,000 each year without the tax on investments. - For the middle and working class At the same time, working- and middle-class households would no longer receive the same financial assistance that Democrats established to help them buy health insurance. Under Obamacare, help was available in the form of health insurance subsidies to people with modest incomes -- those who are not legally impoverished, but who make less than about $48,000 for an individual taxpayer, or about $90,000 for a family of four. Under the Republican plan, Americans would receive tax credits based primarily on their ages, not their incomes. Individual earners making less than $75,000 a year would receive a fixed benefit based on their ages, with older taxpayers receiving more because of the increased cost of insurance for older patients. Taxpayers making more than that amount would receive a less generous credit, but those earning any amount less than that would receive the same payment as other people of the same age. As a result, a single 45-year-old earning as much as $75,000 a year could be better off under the Republican plan, since that taxpayer would not receive help under the current system, established under Obama. Meanwhile, a single 45-year-old making half that amount would receive the same payment as the wealthier taxpayer of the same age. That payment might be less generous than the one she would receive in the existing system, depending on where she lives. Roy pointed out that some provisions in the Republican bill could help the middle class financially. For instance, the bill would repeal a tax on tanning beds, and it would further delay a tax on especially generous health-insurance plans. This tax, known as the Cadillac tax, often applies to plans that employers offer to members of unions. Among households with roughly middling incomes, about 12 percent would enjoy a tax cut if the tax on these plans were repealed, according to the Tax Policy Center. For families that would benefit, the relief would be worth about $930 a year on average. The Republican plan would also reduce taxes on health savings accounts, which some middle-class families use to prepare for medical expenses. This provision, however, would likely have greater benefits for wealthier families, who can save more and can better take advantage of savings accounts that are sheltered from taxes as a result. Also, the bill would eliminate some regulations on health-insurance plans that Democrats imposed. As a result, insurance companies would be able to offer less comprehensive but cheaper insurance. For some families, Roy said, those skimpier plans could be an opportunity to save money. Roy warned, however, that those savings would likely not make up for the reduction in subsidies for taxpayers in the middle class and would leave many Americans unable to afford health care. - For the poor Finally, the plan would likely make Medicaid, the federal program that provides health insurance to the poor, less generous over the long term. Obamacare gave states the option to expand the criteria for qualifying for Medicaid and offered federal funds to pick up the vast majority of the associated costs. Under the GOP plan, however, that expanded criteria for qualifying for Medicaid would go away after 2020, at which time states would not be able to enroll new or returning patients from the expanded criteria in the program. Meanwhile, the federal Medicaid payments to states will be limited based on the number of residents in poverty and the prices of medical treatment. These limits will not be adjusted based on the average age of each state's residents or if states confront unexpected costs, said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist who served as a health-care official in the Obama administration. As a result, the resources available to care for poor Americans could decline relative to what states would receive in the existing system, especially as the population ages. On the whole, Aron-Dine said, the Republican bill would increase inequality, reducing taxes for the wealthy at the expense of affordable insurance for ordinary Americans. "Millions of people are going to lose their health coverage," she said. "Millions or tens of millions of people are going to see higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs."

One of the country’s most prominent white nationalists, Richard Spencer, was kicked out of the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday after conference organizers gave him credentials to attend and then wavered on whether to let him stay. It was the second time in a week that the organizers of the annual conference have awkwardly pushed out a far-right supporter of President Trump. Last week, CPAC organizers who had invited the British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos to give a speech quickly disinvited him after footage emerged of Yiannopoulos appearing to promote pedophilia. The tentative purges are a sign of the challenges conservatives face in policing the outer boundaries of their movement as Trump takes the GOP in a more nationalist direction. The shift, while energizing many working-class voters, has also attracted the vocal support of white nationalists like Spencer, who coined the term “alternative right” to describe his far-right views on separating the races. Attending CPAC requires registration and can cost up to $300, and Spencer came to CPAC to attend a speech that was critical of the “alt-right.” In 2015 and 2016, Spencer’s alt-right label became associated with a loose-knit movement of white nationalists, misogynists and anti-Semites who often harassed prominent liberals online and supported Trump’s rhetoric about stopping Muslim immigration and deporting immigrants who had entered the U.S. illegally. For the most part, the term is now embraced mostly by white nationalists. After leaving the speech, Spencer was quickly surrounded by a crowd of journalists who quizzed him on his views as curious passersby craned their necks to see who was causing such a scene. Several asked, “Who is that?” A bearded Trump voter who was wearing a denim vest and a bandanna with an eagle on it and called himself “Grizzly Joe” confronted Spencer for attending the conference. ”He’s a white supremacist,” the man said after walking away. “He shouldn’t be here jumping on the Republican bandwagon. Supremacists of any kind are no use to the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, anybody. They’re savages.” The reclusive mastermind behind President Donald Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for "deconstruction of the administrative state."

The reclusive mastermind behind President Donald Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for "deconstruction of the administrative state." Stephen... CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp at one point stood about a dozen feet from the crowd around Spencer and defended the conference for allowing Spencer in, while trying to distance CPAC from the fringe Spencer represents. “The alt-right does not have a legitimate voice in the conservative movement,” said Schlapp, adding that “nobody from that movement is speaking at CPAC.” Schlapp added, of Spencer, “This is America, and we have to deal with the laws and, you know, all I can tell you is that if he had comments we’d agree with, he’d be on our stage, but he’s not on our stage.” When asked if Schlapp wanted Spencer to leave, Schlapp responded: “Richard Spencer is not on our agenda, we did not invite him, there’s all kinds of people I suppose who can buy tickets, we have a constitution, we have laws in this country, and I think it would be better if y’all [journalists] didn’t give him attention.” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Thursday that she intends to forge ahead with her approach to overhauling U.S. schools, declaring that the Obama administration's efforts to improve them had failed "miserably" and taking a swipe at journalists and critics who have called her ill-prepared for...

Though, Schlapp added, “I’d rather he not be here.” Twenty minutes later, a security guard asked Spencer to leave, and Spencer left — but he first spoke with dozens of journalists who had come to cover CPAC. In an email, a spokesman for the conference told The Times, “He is not welcome here.” Spencer said CPAC had fired the first shot. “The fact is, people want to talk to me, not these boring conservatives,” Spencer said. He added, “CPAC can’t hold a speech denouncing the alt-right and expect me not to come.” matt.pearce@latimes.com @mattdpearce

Tens of thousands of people marched in streets across the United States on Saturday, staging the fourth day of protests of Donald Trump's surprise victory as president. The protests — held in big cities such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago as well as smaller ones, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, and Iowa City, Iowa — were largely peaceful Saturday, although two police officers were slightly injured during protests in Indianapolis. Protesters rallied at New York's Union Square before taking their cause up Fifth Avenue toward Trump Tower, where they were held back by police barricades. The Republican president-elect was holed up inside his tower apartment, working with aides on the transition to the White House. Among those railing against him was filmmaker Michael Moore, who tweeted a demand that Trump "step aside." Fashion designer Noemi Abad, 30, agreed. "I just can't have Donald Trump running this country and teaching our children racism, sexism and bigotry," she said. "Out of his own mouth he made this division. He needs to go — there's no place for racism in society in America." Trump's comments — particularly a 2005 recording of him making lewd comments about women — sparked outrage during his campaign. That spilled over into demonstrations following an election that ended with half of U.S. voters choosing the other candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton. People protesting both the Dakota Access Pipeline and the election of Donald Trump pass by the Chicago Theatre during a march from Federal Plaza to Trump Tower in Chicago on Nov. 12, 2016. People protesting both the Dakota Access Pipeline and the election of Donald Trump pass by the Chicago Theatre during a march from Federal Plaza to Trump Tower in Chicago on Nov. 12, 2016. Demonstrators in Indianapolis on Saturday threw rocks at police, slightly injuring two officers, said Police Chief Troy Riggs. Some protesters began chanting threats including "Kill the Police," and officers moved in to arrest seven demonstrators. Police briefly fired pepper balls into the crowd during the confrontation. "We believe that we have some instigators that arrived in our city," trying to start a riot, Riggs said. Rowdy demonstrators marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, for the fourth night Saturday despite calls from the mayor and police chief for calm. Several hundred people took to the streets and Portland authorities made multiple arrests after protesters threw bottles and other items at officers in riot gear and blocked streets and light rail lines. The exact number of arrests wasn't immediately available. The gathering came after a news conference Saturday in which Mayor Charlie Hayes and Police Chief Mike Marshman urged restraint after several days of violent marches that damaged property and left one person shot. Friday night, police used flash-bang grenades to disperse a crowd of hundreds in the downtown area. Seventeen people were arrested and one man was shot and suffered non life-threatening injuries in what police described as a confrontation with gang members. Two people were arrested on attempted murder charges. In Los Angeles, an estimated 8,000 people marched through downtown streets Saturday to condemn what they saw as Trump's hate speech about Muslims, pledge to deport people in the country illegally and crude comments about women. Jennifer Cruz, 18, of Ventura, California, carried a sign that asked: "Legalize weed but not my Mom?" — a reference to Californians' Tuesday passage of a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use. Cruz said her parents have been in the United States illegally for 30 years, although her mother has spent years seeking citizenship. She called the possibility of their deportation terrifying. "We talk about it almost every day," she said. "My Mom wants to leave it in the hands of God, but I'm not just going to sit back and not do anything. I'm going to fight for my parents, even if it kills me." Shawn Smith, 41, of Los Angeles, wore an American flag vest and held a glittery sign that said "Love Trumps Hate." "What he's been able to do is make 50 percent of the nation look over their shoulder," he said. "If you're gay, if you're LGBT, if you're Muslim, if you're Latin, if you're special needs, if you're female, it's a much unsafer place now." "What is happening today is going to be the normal for a while," he said of the demonstration, "because we're not going to just sit back and watch our rights being taken away, our health care being taken away." Meanwhile, several dozen Trump supporters gathered at his vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to urge the protesters to give him a chance. One person held a cross that read "All lives matter to me." In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395. "Trump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be," he said. "There is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong." Protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington, Iowa City and more. More than 200 people, carrying signs, gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted "not my president" and "no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA." In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. In Cincinnati, hundreds of protesters already had taken to the streets early Saturday afternoon to protest a jury's failure to reach a verdict in the trial of a white former police officer who killed an unarmed black motorist in 2015. A mistrial was declared in the trial of former University of Cincinnati officer Ray Tensing. He was fired after shooting Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate last year. Several hundred anti-Trump protesters joined the trial protesters and marched through downtown Cincinnati. In Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted "No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here" Saturday as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction. Sonja Spray, 29, who heard about the protest on Facebook, said she has signed an online petition urging the electoral college to honor the popular vote and elect Clinton. Demonstrations also took place internationally. A group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the "unrest" that's already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. President Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump's election. Associated Press

Democrats and labor organizers spent Sunday at dozens of rallies across the country, pledging to fight in Congress against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and any attempt to change Medicare or Medicaid. The party's leaders faced crowds ranging in size from dozens to thousands of people, urging them to call Republicans and protest the push for repeal. "Nobody's gonna shut us up! Nobody's gonna turn us around!" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the Democrats' 2016 vice-presidential candidate, at a rally in Richmond that drew a crowd of at least 1,000. "We're standing in the breach and battling for tens of millions of Americans!" "Our First Stand," the catchall theme for the protests, represents one of the the earliest protests by an opposition party against an incoming president. Brainstormed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Democratic leaders in Congress, each rally introduced crowds to men and women who had faced death or bankruptcy before the ACA went into effect, then challenged Republicans to listen to their stories. Rattled during the ACA's passage by tea party protests and raucous congressional town hall meetings, Democrats were flipping the script. "The immediate goal of the rallies is to show Republicans that the majority of people are against repealing the Affordable Care Act," Sanders said in an interview this week. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at podium, cheers health care workers to save the Affordable Care Act across the country outside LAC+USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at podium, cheers health care workers to save the Affordable Care Act across the country outside LAC+USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017. "I think people are waking up to the fact that the Affordable Care Act has been helping tens of millions of Americans," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., after a rally in Bowie, Maryland, organized by Maryland Democrats that drew 1,500 people. "Energizing the public around a common goal can have an important result." In Bowie, a number of rally attendees said they were also planning to join the Women's March to be held in Washington, D.C., the day after Trump's inauguration. Some lifted unofficial signs from Sanders' 2016 primary campaign; others said they had been galvanized by the election itself. Valencia Danner, 23, said that the Bowie rally was her first political event of any kind. Scott Gledhill, 73, said that he'd voted for Gary Johnson for president but was worried about Republicans' plans regarding the ACA and Medicare. "Two months after aging into Medicare, I got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer," he said. "My bill would have been half a million dollars. I would have lost everything I had, after a whole lifetime of work and saving." The rallies also demonstrated how the party's restive left is shaping its response to Trump. Some activists rallied while chastising the Democrats who had voted against an amendment to the Republicans' repeal resolution that would have made it easier to import prescription drugs from Canada. In Bowie, some of the loudest cheers came when Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said he "might end up voting to impeach" Trump, and one activist interrupted House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and urged him to "boycott the inauguration" like Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. Thousands of people attended dozens of rallies across the country Sunday, pledging to fight against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and any attempt to change Medicare or Medicaid. "John Lewis and I are going to be doing our job on the floor," said Hoyer, evading the question. (He is not planning to skip the inauguration.) "We had an election, and over 2 million more people voted to keep the Affordable Care Act than to repeal it." Sanders himself headlined a rally of more than 10,000 people in Michigan's Macomb County. The county, made up of suburbs of Detroit that voted for Barack Obama twice and flipped to Donald Trump, has become an emblem of the shifts that shocked Democrats and lost them the presidency. Before and after Sanders spoke, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and leaders of local unions defended the ACA itself -- but then added that reform might mean something more progressive. "How about a public option? Single-payer?" said Stabenow, referring to two progressive plans that would effectively expand Medicare to younger people. "We've got things we can do." Sanders, who as a candidate called for on an ambitious, European-style reform of the health-care system, used his own speech to renew that call. "Our job today is to defend the ACA," Sanders said. "Our job tomorrow is to bring about a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system." Those plans were non-starters during the 2009-2010 congressional debate on health care. Since then, however, losses in conservative states and districts have moved the Democratic Party to the left, and the surprise defeat of Hillary Clinton has made Democrats question the political power of incremental, compromise-built policies. But for all Democrats, the immediate policy threat is to the existing Affordable Care Act. In Bowie, leaders distributed lists of Republicans to call and urged people to call their relatives in red states to get them to join the cause. Van Hollen suggested that repeal could be stopped entirely if three Senate Republicans could be turned against it. In Richmond, after the choir from Kaine's church sang "We Shall Overcome," the senator had the same message. He described the late-night drama of last week's budget "vote-a-rama," which saw Democrats lose vote after vote to defend the ACA. "We wouldn't sit down! We wouldn't shut up! Because this isn't business as usual!" Kaine said. "Why don't we just jump off a cliff, then we'll figure out how to land while we're in mid-air? That's what they're saying." At the rally in San Francisco, Silvia Pena, a 45-year-old nanny, said she had never had held insurance until she enrolled in the Affordable Care Act six years ago. "I don't have health issues, but you can need insurance any time. We should all have access to health services," said Pena, who held a sign that read "It's our right and our body. Keep Planned Parenthood and Obamacare." About 2,000 people cheered and held rainbow and American flags and signs that read "Don't Make America Sick Again" and "Health Care For All" at the rally. Patients who survived cancer, strokes and other health difficulties are sharing stories on how they benefited from the mandated health insurance. In Los Angeles, organizers of the rally outside the LA County/USC Medical Center warned that a repeal of the law without a replacement will throw the state's health care system into chaos and strip coverage from 5 million Californians. Rallies in other cities in support of the health law also were well attended. Police estimated about 600 people showed up in Portland, Maine. Hundreds also attended events in Newark, New Jersey, Johnston, Rhode Island, Richmond, Virginia and Boston.

Contrary to what he told Congress at his confirmation hearing, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions did indeed “have communications with the Russians” when he was a top Trump campaign advisor on national security. But did Sessions commit perjury? Perjury accusations have bedeviled many other Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress in recent decades. It was a central accusation in President Clinton’s impeachment. Prosecutors have also put sports stars and business moguls on trial for perjury. In Sessions’ case, even President Trump conceded that the former Alabama senator “could have stated his response more accurately.” Sessions, the Washington Post reported Wednesday, spoke twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential campaign. Making a false statement, however, is not necessarily perjury. It’s violating an oath to tell the truth by stating something that the person knows to be false. Under federal law, perjury is a felony if the false statement involves anything “material” in a legal matter. It carries a penalty of up to five years in prison — or eight years in terrorism cases. Yes. Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe and some other Trump critics were quick to conclude that Sessions committed perjury. Sessions has denied making any dishonest statements to Congress. He said he intended to state that he did not discuss election matters with the Russians — not that he didn’t speak with them at all. Democrats on Capitol Hill have clamored for Sessions’ resignation, but some of the party’s key lawmakers were still cautious about accusing him of breaking the law. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said Sessions “clearly misled the Senate.” Yes. House Republicans alleged in August that Clinton perjured herself in testimony to Congress on her use of a private email server when she was secretary of State. They argued, among other things, that Clinton stated falsely that she neither sent nor received emails that were marked classified at the time they were transmitted through the private server. FBI Director James B. Comey said it was unclear whether Clinton realized a few of the emails were classified, and he recommended against prosecution. Clinton was never charged with a crime. With his senior staff not yet in place at the Justice Department, the decision on whether to investigate or prosecute Sessions would be up to the acting deputy attorney general, Dana J. Boente, who is also U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Trump put Boente in that job after firing Sally Yates, the Obama administration holdover who refused to defend Trump’s executive order to ban refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The federal law on special prosecutors expired in 1999. But Richard W. Painter, who was associate counsel to President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, said Trump could still name one — a step the president seems unlikely to take. To ensure a special prosecutor is widely perceived as independent, Painter suggested that Trump name a three-judge panel to make the choice. Yes. John N. Mitchell, an attorney general under President Nixon, served 19 months in prison in the 1970s after he was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate scandal. Mitchell’s successor as attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, was charged with making false statements to the Senate at his confirmation hearing. Kleindienst told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he’d never spoken with anyone at the White House about a Justice Department antitrust suit against a big Republican donor, International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. But an Oval Office tape later revealed that Nixon had told Kleindienst to drop the case. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of failing to testify fully. His 30-day jail sentence was suspended. Painter, now a law professor at the University of Minnesota, argues that Sessions’ statement about not communicating with the Russians was essentially the same conduct as Kleindienst’s. Is it mostly people in politics who get prosecuted for perjury? No. Former San Francisco Giants star Barry Bonds was charged with perjury for his testimony before a grand jury investigating illegal steroid distribution. The perjury case ended in a hung jury, and an appeals court overturned Bonds’ felony conviction on a related obstruction of justice charge. Former New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens was acquitted of perjury in 2012 after a trial on charges that he lied to Congress about never using steroids or human growth hormone. Basketball forward Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings was charged with perjury for lying to a grand jury about accepting money from a booster while playing at the University of Michigan. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and did no jail time. Kimberly Jones, the rapper who goes by Lil’ Kim, was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $50,000 for perjury. She was convicted of lying to a grand jury about a 2001 shootout among rival rappers in Manhattan. And lifestyle maven Martha Stewart served five months in prison after she was convicted of perjury and other charges in 2004 for lying to federal law enforcement authorities about a stock sale. michael.finnegan@latimes.com Twitter: @finneganLAT

Democrats forced delays Tuesday in planned Senate committee votes on President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries and attorney general, amid growing Democratic surliness over the administration's aggressive early moves against refugees and an expected bitter battle over filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Democrats abruptly boycotted a Senate Finance Committee meeting called to vote on Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the Health nominee and Steve Mnuchin, Trump's Treasury selection, saying both had misled Congress about their financial backgrounds. The Democrats' action prevented the Finance panel from acting because under committee rules, 13 of its members — including at least one Democrat — must be present for votes. It was unclear when the panel would reschedule to votes. At the Senate Judiciary Committee, a meeting considering Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to be attorney general lasted so long — chiefly because of lengthy Democratic speeches — that Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the panel would meet again Wednesday. The meeting on Sessions' nomination was coming with Democrats and demonstrators around the country in an uproar over Trump's executive order temporarily blocking refugees. Even some Republicans were warning it could hinder anti-terrorism efforts. President Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary, in written responses to questions from senators, appears to have used several sentences and phrases from other sources without attribution - including from a top Obama administration civil rights official.

The responses from nominee Betsy... Not everything ground to a halt. The Senate education committee voted 12-11 to send Trump's pick to head the Education Department, Betsy DeVos, to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee quickly approved former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as Energy secretary by 16-7, and Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to head Interior by 16-6. And the full Senate easily confirmed Elaine Chao to become transportation secretary by a 93-6 vote. Chao was labor secretary under President George W. Bush, and is wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Just before the Finance committee was scheduled to vote on Price and Mnuchin, Democrats called a briefing for reporters and announced their plan to force a delay. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said Price and Mnuchin would hold positions "that directly affect peoples' lives every day. The truth matters." Alabama Sen.

Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, accused Democrats of "a lack of desire to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities." "They ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots," he said. In 2013 when Democrats controlled the Senate, Republicans boycotted a committee vote on Gina McCarthy to head the Environmental Protection Agency, temporarily stalling it. Democrats cited one report in The Wall Street Journal that Price received a special, discounted offer to buy stock in a biomedical company, which contradicted his testimony to Congress. They said another report in The Columbus Dispatch showed documents revealing that Mnuchin had not been truthful with the Senate in the confirmation process in comments about how his bank OneWest had handled home foreclosures. Republicans have supported both men, and both have strongly defended their actions. Democrats have opposed Price, a seven-term congressional veteran, for his staunch backing of his party's drive to scuttle Obama's health care law and to reshape Medicare and Medicaid, which help older and low-income people afford medical care. Republican leaders made their hopes clear last month. Sitting at a long senate dais, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt held up four fingers, noting that Elaine Chao had made her way through the confirmation process multiple times over the decades "without a dissenting vote on the Senate floor."

On Tuesday,... They've also assailed Price for buying stocks of health care firms, accusing him of using insider information and conflicts of interest for backing legislation that could help his investments. Price says his trades were largely managed by brokers and that he's followed congressional ethics rules. Democrats have criticized Mnuchin for not initially revealing nearly $100 million in assets, and were expected to vote against both nominees. They've also accused him of failing to protect homeowners from foreclosures and criticized him for not initially disclosing all his assets. DeVos, a wealthy GOP donor and conservative activist, has long supported charter schools and allowing school choice. That's prompted opposition from Democrats and teachers' unions who view her stance as a threat to federal dollars that support public education. Critics have also mocked her for suggesting that guns could be justified in schools to protect students from grizzly bears. Two prominent Republicans on the education committee, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said they remained uncertain if they will vote for her on the Senate floor. Murkowski said DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America's struggling schools and its children. Associated Press

Critics of GOP health care legislation got fresh ammunition from a report that estimates the bill would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 14 million people next year alone, and 24 million over a decade. The findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could make prospects for the legislation backed by President Donald Trump even tougher, with a few House and Senate conservatives already in open revolt and moderate Republicans queasy about big cuts to the Medicaid safety net for the poor. But with the legislation headed for votes in the House Budget Committee within days and floor action next week, its supporters at the White House and on Capitol Hill showed no sign of retreat. Instead, they attacked the parts of the CBO report they didn't like, while touting the more favorable findings, including smaller deficits from their bill and lower premiums over time. "I'm pretty encouraged by it, it actually exceeded my expectations," House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said on Fox News Channel shortly after the report was released Monday evening. Ryan said the CBO findings about millions losing coverage were to be expected, because the GOP legislation removes the penalty in former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act aimed at coercing people into buying coverage. "If we're not going to force someone to buy something they don't want to buy they're not going to buy it, and that's kind of obvious," Ryan said. The GOP legislation would use tax credits to help consumers buy health coverage, expand health savings accounts, phase out an expansion of Medicaid and cap that program for the future, end some requirements for health plans under Obama's law, and scrap a number of taxes. Ryan pointed to other CBO figures, including that the GOP bill reduces federal deficits by $337 billion over a decade, and begins to bring down insurance premiums by around 10 percent starting in 2020, though that comes only after premiums sharply rise in 2018 and 2019. Democrats scoffed at Ryan's positive take, calling the CBO analysis damning evidence that Republicans are interested only in giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the rich, which their bill would accomplish, while yanking health coverage from the poor. "I hope they would pull the bill. It's really the only decent thing to do," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said. "How can they look their constituents in the eye when they say to them '24 million of you will no longer have coverage.'" Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Senate’s top Democrat, said the CBO report should be a "knockout blow” for the legislation. At the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price rejected portions of the CBO's findings, in comments that seemed to contradict Speaker Ryan. "We believe that the plan that we're putting in place is going to insure more individuals than currently are insured. So we think the CBO simply has it wrong," Price said It was unclear exactly what impact the CBO news would have on the debate. Republicans were already planning to move forward with no Democratic votes, aiming for action by the full House next week and the Senate the week after that. Senate prospects look particularly dicey, given the GOP's slim 52-48 majority and vociferous objections from several Republicans including Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senators were just beginning to absorb the CBO findings Monday night. The approaching winter storm had delayed the arrival of House members to the Capitol. "It's awful. It has to be a concern," Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said of the budget office findings. "President Trump said he wanted as many people covered as under Obamacare." "At the end of the day, we should pause and try to improve the product in light of the CBO analysis rather than just rejecting it," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Price planned to meet with GOP senators Tuesday to discuss the issue. All along Republican leaders have assumed that once it comes time to vote, few if any Republicans will dare vote "no" on the repeal and replacement of "Obamacare" that their party has been promising for seven years. They are relying on Trump's popularity with conservative voters to close the deal, and Trump on Monday announced he would be traveling to Kentucky for a rally early next week. But the Congressional Budget report seemed likely to increase some Republicans' discomfort with their approach, especially those representing states that expanded Medicaid coverage under Obama's law. Roughly 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage over a decade as the GOP bill cuts $880 billion from the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled, the CBO said. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, but the bill would violate that pledge, as well as fail to meet Trump's stated goal of "insurance for everybody." The CBO report also undercuts a central argument that Trump and other Republicans have cited for swiftly rolling back Obama's health care overhaul: that the health insurance markets created under the 2010 law are unstable and about to implode. The congressional experts said that largely would not be the case and the market for individual health insurance policies "would probably be stable in most areas either under current law or the (GOP) legislation."

House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would lower the number of Americans with health insurance by 24 million while reducing the federal deficit by $337 billion by 2026, congressional budget analysts said Monday. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection, 14 million fewer people would have health insurance next year alone. Premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in the first year compared with the Affordable Care Act and 10 percent lower on average after 2026. By and large, older Americans would pay "substantially" more and younger Americans less, the report said. The report from the Congressional Budget Office fueled concerns that the GOP health-care plan would prompt a dramatic loss in health-insurance coverage, potentially contradicting President Donald Trump's vow that health-care reform would provide "insurance for everybody" and threatening support from moderate Republican lawmakers. Yet it also boosted House leaders' efforts to persuade skeptical conservatives, who felt that the measure did not go far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act, to support what the CBO now predicts will be deficit-reducing legislation. The analysis immediately prompted a clash of reactions between the White House and Republican leaders. Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said the report is "just absurd," and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said: "We disagree strenuously" with it. Ryan defended the report, saying that it proves that the proposal will "dramatically" reduce the deficit and usher in "the most fundamental entitlement reform in a generation." "Our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage," he said. "It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down. That's what this report shows." The release of the CBO's report marks the beginning of a new phase in the debate over the week-old health-care bill, which is moving through the House on an accelerated timetable despite opposition from Republicans, Democrats and virtually every sector of the U.S. health-care industry. Conservative Republicans, in particular, have demanded changes to the measure in exchange for their support. The CBO report offered conclusions that might neutralize some conservative concerns, perhaps softening those members' opposition to the measure. The conservative House Freedom Caucus did not immediately provide a response to the report. At the same time, some moderate Republicans expressed concerns about the number of people who would lose coverage. "These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. "I don't think that the bill that is being considered now is the bill that ultimately will be the one that we vote on in the Senate." Democrats cited the CBO numbers to support their flat-out opposition to the plan. "The CBO score shows just how empty the president's promises, that everyone will be covered and costs will go down, have been," said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. "This should be a looming stop sign for the Republicans repeal effort." "I would hope that this would make the Republicans say 'we can't do this," said Sen. Patty Murray, Wash., a member of Democratic leadership. "Twenty-four million people lose their coverage, it is total chaos to the country and I hope they pause, say 'This is not what we should be doing,' and move on." The White House has spent the past week engaged in a charm offensive aimed at bringing conservatives on board, as well as an effort to discredit the CBO before it released numbers that might cast the plan in a negative light. "If you're looking to the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week. Ryan had predicted that the CBO would forecast a loss in coverage, but he had also suggested that those affected would be exercising their choice not to buy health plans, a choice that is penalized under the Affordable Care Act. "CBO will say, 'Well, gosh, not as many people will get coverage,' " Ryan said Sunday in an appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation." "You know why? Because this isn't a government mandate." "It's up to people," he said. "People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country." The Affordable Care Act has increased coverage by 20 million to 22 million - almost half of those through the insurance markets the law created for people who cannot get affordable coverage through a job, and the rest through an expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. According to the report, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured in 2026, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under the current law. "Obviously, we want to improve those coverage numbers," said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. "But when you don't punish people for their refusal to buy a government-approved insurance [plan], some people are going to make the decision not to buy it." This reasoning would only account for the immediate increase in the uninsured, according to the CBO. Eventually, many people would lose health insurance because the legislation's tax credits would be less generous than those in the current law and because some states might undo the expansion of their Medicaid programs. "All I can tell you it is a work in progress," Cornyn said of the bill. The Trump administration led a broad effort to undercut the Congressional Budget Office over the weekend, including pointing out flaws in its forecasts for the Affordable Care Act. "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are," said Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. "Sometimes we ask them to do stuff they're not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isn't the best use of their time." "The CBO estimate five, six, seven years ago when this started, they estimated that over 20 million people would have coverage at the end of the ten-year window," Price said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "In fact, it's about half of that right now. So CBO has been very adept in not providing appropriate coverage statistics." Price, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, had previously celebrated the selection of CBO Director Keith Hall in 2015, saying he would bring an "impressive level of economic expertise and experience." In private meetings last week, Trump suggested he was open to significant changes to the bill to appease hardliners skeptical of the bill. By the end of the week, however, the White House clarified it was siding with House Republican leaders on at least one request from the hardliners: speeding up cuts to Medicaid eligibility. "Right now, the date that's in the bill is what the president supports," Spicer told reporters. "It's not a question of negotiation," he added. On Friday, members of the House Freedom Caucus remained split over which elements more urgently needed change. Some called for changing the Medicaid timetable, while others urged the elimination of basic benefit requirements for health plans. On Sunday, a growing group of conservatives was still threatening to kill the plan unless GOP leaders agreed to renegotiate parts of it. "He will not have the votes," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said of Ryan on CBS' "Face the Nation." "Everybody is being nice to everybody because they want us to vote for this, but we're not going to vote for it." In January, Trump had promised to replace the ACA with a plan that provided "insurance for everybody." "There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us," Trump said in a Jan. 15 interview with The Washington Post. "It's not going to be their plan," Trump said of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. "It'll be another plan. But they'll be beautifully covered. I don't want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people."

The White House has spent the past week engaged in a charm offensive aimed at bringing conservatives on board, as well as an effort to discredit the CBO before it released numbers that might cast the plan in a negative light. "If you're looking to the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week. Ryan had predicted that the CBO would forecast a loss in coverage, but he had also suggested that those affected would be exercising their choice not to buy health plans, a choice that is penalized under the Affordable Care Act. "CBO will say, 'Well, gosh, not as many people will get coverage,' " Ryan said Sunday in an appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation." "You know why? Because this isn't a government mandate." "It's up to people," he said. "People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country." The Affordable Care Act has increased coverage by 20 million to 22 million - almost half of those through the insurance markets the law created for people who cannot get affordable coverage through a job, and the rest through an expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. According to the report, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured in 2026, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under the current law. "Obviously, we want to improve those coverage numbers," said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. "But when you don't punish people for their refusal to buy a government-approved insurance [plan], some people are going to make the decision not to buy it." This reasoning would only account for the immediate increase in the uninsured, according to the CBO. Eventually, many people would lose health insurance because the legislation's tax credits would be less generous than those in the current law and because some states might undo the expansion of their Medicaid programs. "All I can tell you it is a work in progress," Cornyn said of the bill. The Trump administration led a broad effort to undercut the Congressional Budget Office over the weekend, including pointing out flaws in its forecasts for the Affordable Care Act. "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are," said Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. "Sometimes we ask them to do stuff they're not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isn't the best use of their time." "The CBO estimate five, six, seven years ago when this started, they estimated that over 20 million people would have coverage at the end of the ten-year window," Price said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "In fact, it's about half of that right now. So CBO has been very adept in not providing appropriate coverage statistics." Price, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, had previously celebrated the selection of CBO Director Keith Hall in 2015, saying he would bring an "impressive level of economic expertise and experience." In private meetings last week, Trump suggested he was open to significant changes to the bill to appease hardliners skeptical of the bill. By the end of the week, however, the White House clarified it was siding with House Republican leaders on at least one request from the hardliners: speeding up cuts to Medicaid eligibility. "Right now, the date that's in the bill is what the president supports," Spicer told reporters. "It's not a question of negotiation," he added. On Friday, members of the House Freedom Caucus remained split over which elements more urgently needed change. Some called for changing the Medicaid timetable, while others urged the elimination of basic benefit requirements for health plans. On Sunday, a growing group of conservatives was still threatening to kill the plan unless GOP leaders agreed to renegotiate parts of it. "He will not have the votes," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said of Ryan on CBS' "Face the Nation." "Everybody is being nice to everybody because they want us to vote for this, but we're not going to vote for it." In January, Trump had promised to replace the ACA with a plan that provided "insurance for everybody." "There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us," Trump said in a Jan. 15 interview with The Washington Post. "It's not going to be their plan," Trump said of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. "It'll be another plan. But they'll be beautifully covered. I don't want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people."

Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and serious threat to the plan crafted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was the growing backlash from conservative lawmakers and powerful outside groups who argue the draft is nothing more than "Obamacare Lite," a disparaging reference to the former president's signature 2010 domestic achievement. The lawmakers do not represent a majority of Republicans in either chamber of Congress, but there could be enough of them to scuttle any health-care bill they oppose - and several said Tuesday they intend to use that leverage to force major changes to the measures. Their efforts could begin Wednesday morning at markups of the legislation before the House Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce panels. But President Donald Trump - who weighed in backing the plan on Twitter - said at a meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday afternoon that he would work with them to secure passage of their plan. President Trump said Tuesday that he was “proud” to support House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, asserting that his party was committed to seeing the plan through. "Obamacare is collapsing," Trump said in remarks at the White House to Republican lawmakers responsible... President Trump said Tuesday that he was “proud” to support House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, asserting that his party was committed to seeing the plan through. "Obamacare is collapsing," Trump said in remarks at the White House to Republican lawmakers responsible... According to several attendees, Trump made clear that he wants the House bill to be approved and land on his desk largely intact. He pledged to become personally involved in persuading skeptical lawmakers, and warned that failing to pass the legislation would result in trouble at the ballot box for Republicans who pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare. "The president said very clearly . . . this is the bill he wants on his desk, and he wants to get this done quickly," said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House GOP chief deputy whip, who attended the meeting. "The president is paying attention to what people are saying and doing, where they're saying it and doing it. He is highly aware and has a highly attuned ear to what is happening in the press, and has a real understanding of the challenges in order to get this bill on his desk." As if to prove it, Trump targeted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., - who has emerged as the bill's chief skeptic - with a tweet Tuesday evening: "I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!" The margin of error is slim for House and Senate GOP leaders - in the House, Ryan can afford to lose only 21 GOP lawmakers. In the Senate - which is using an unusual parliamentary procedure that requires only a simple majority for legislation to be approved - Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., must persuade all but two Republicans to support the plan. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, and no Democrats are expected to back the overhaul in either chamber. Following late afternoon votes on Tuesday, several Republican senators privately groused that they felt rushed by their GOP colleagues in the House and by Trump, who they said does not fully grasp the Senate's slower pace or its concerns. The senators also expressed skepticism that key White House officials with deep ties to Congress's conservative wing would eventually be able to lock up the votes for the current plan. Instead, they said there is confusion over who is managing the process and which administration figures, if any, have actual power to sway Trump on the issue. One Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are ongoing, said several senators are asking their leadership to "take it easy" in terms of the timeline, allowing space to debate and analyze the proposal with a "clear understanding of the costs involved." "If that takes months or a year, so be it," the senator said. A second GOP senator said the party was making a "mistake" in its rollout by taking "too much ownership" of health care after years in which Democrats were identified with Obamacare. Sen. Rand Paul, R-KY, speaks about Obamacare repeal and replacement during a news conference on Capitol Hill, on March 7, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Sen. Rand Paul, R-KY, speaks about Obamacare repeal and replacement during a news conference on Capitol Hill, on March 7, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The long-anticipated debut of the House GOP plan - after seven years in which Republicans vowed to repeal Obamacare - was far from seamless. Less than 24 hours after its introduction, Ryan and his chief lieutenants were beating back fierce criticism from their right flank about the proposal's chief elements: income and age-based tax subsidies, as well as a redesign of the way that states that expanded their Medicaid coverage under the ACA receive payments. Part of the blowback came from the fact that no cost estimates have yet been provided by the Congressional Budget Office. "Doing big things is never easy, but we have made a promise, and we're going to keep that promise," Ryan said in a late afternoon news conference. The speaker vowed to pass the legislation, pushing back on the idea that it was crafted behind closed doors without input from fellow Republicans. "We'll have 218 votes when this thing comes to the floor, I can guarantee you that." To do so, Ryan will have to appease conservatives inside and outside of Congress, who made themselves heard loudly Tuesday. Ryan outlined three phases in which health-care reform would be achieved: first, via the special budget procedure known as reconciliation, of which the current measures are a part; then, through regulations at the Health and Human Services Department; and finally, the passage of other bills that will need bigger backing and could include the ability to buy insurance across state lines. Republicans belonging to the roughly 30-member hard-line House Freedom Caucus attacked the bill outside the Capitol on Tuesday. Several said they saw the measure as a starting point for negotiations, even as they demanded that leaders take up the 2015 legislation that passed the Republican Congress and ultimately was vetoed by President Barack Obama. Nonpartisan congressional budget analysts estimated that bill would cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance coverage almost immediately. "What we have now is an opening bid," said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a Freedom Caucus member who has offered an alternative health plan that would offer less generous aid for individuals to buy insurance. Lawmakers may also be persuaded by outside groups such as Heritage Action for America, the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, which came out strongly against the leadership proposal Tuesday, dubbing the plan "Obamacare Lite," "RyanCare" or "RINOcare," the latter a reference to "Republican in name only," a popular conservative epithet for establishment politicians. Those groups are adept at riling up the GOP base against Republican leaders and could cause significant headaches for Ryan. "The House Republican proposal released last night not only accepts the flawed progressive premises of Obamacare but expands upon them," Michael Needham, the head of Heritage Action for America, said in a statement Tuesday. "Congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on long-standing campaign promises that create a free market health care system." After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... After weeks of expectations — actually, nearly seven years of expectations — House Republicans on Monday released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Elements of the proposal, which was kept under lock and key last week — have been dribbling out for a few days. The text of the bill... FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth both decried the plan as a betrayal of Republican campaign promises. "If this warmed-over substitute for government-run health care remains unchanged, the Club for Growth will key vote against it," said the group's president, David McIntosh, referring to a process in which lawmakers are graded on their votes, the better to use them as ammunition on the campaign trail. Furthermore, at least one of the country's biggest health-care groups weighed in with caution on the proposal. The American Hospital Association, representing 5,000 hospitals and other health-care groups, argued that the process should not advance until the CBO provides a cost estimate. There were some signs of hope for the House leadership's approach. Besides Trump's backing, Vice President Pence attended a Senate Republican policy luncheon and, in a break with normal practice, joined McConnell and other GOP leaders at a news conference afterward to defend the House plan as "the framework for reform." McConnell also said he planned to put the House bill on the floor once it reaches the Senate. "We are certainly open to improvements and recommendations in the legislative process, but this is the bill, and the president supports the American Health Care Act," he said. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that would consider health-care legislation, said Pence so far has been an able salesman for Trump, working on the front lines of Congress and understanding how to build consensus behind closed doors from his days in the House. "He keeps coming to lunch after lunch. He's always around, and his style is low-key," Alexander said. "He doesn't overstate his case." White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney met with members of the Freedom Caucus on Tuesday night for more than an hour. Members of the group left the meeting convinced that the Trump administration was open to negotiations on the health-care bill and insisted that House leaders had not secured the votes to pass it. "As things stand now, the speaker's going to need a lot of Democrat votes to pass what would be the largest welfare program ever sponsored by the Republican Party," said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala. In another sign of the administration's support, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price sent a letter Tuesday to key lawmakers calling the measure a "necessary and important first step toward fulfilling our promises to the American people." The Senate also poses a problem for Republican leaders, with Sens. Paul, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, opposing the House draft. Paul and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that they would reintroduce the 2015 legislation. The dilemma Republican congressional leaders face is that if they change the legislation to appease hard-line conservatives, they are likely to alienate more-moderate members who are wary of disrupting insurance markets and taking away coverage from those who gained it under the ACA. Four Senate Republicans have expressed worries about the plan's possible impact on lower-income people who received Medicaid coverage through the ACA's expansion of that program. The four senators are split on what proposals would meet their standards, but none is likely to support the course of action favored by many conservatives. "What we need is not really from the White House - it's the CBO on the cost estimates. That'd be most helpful," said Maine Sen. Susan Collins (R).

The reclusive mastermind behind President Donald Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for "deconstruction of the administrative state." Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist and intellectual force behind Trump's agenda, used his first speaking appearance since Trump took office to vow that the president would honor all of the hard-line pledges of his campaign. Appearing at a gathering of conservative activists alongside Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Bannon dismissed the idea that Trump might moderate his positions or seek consensus with political opponents. Rather, he said, the White House is digging in for a long period of conflict to transform Washington and upend the world order. "If you think they're going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken," Bannon said in reference to the media and opposition forces. "Every day, it is going to be a fight." He continued, "And that is what I'm proudest about Donald Trump. All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, 'Oh, you've got to moderate' - every day in the Oval Office, he tells Reince and I, 'I committed this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I'm going to deliver on this.' " Bannon and Priebus shared the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference for 25 minutes in a buddy routine. They strived to prove that they are not rivals in Trump's competing power circles, as has been reported, but rather partners working from 6:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. each day, often in the same office suite, to muscle through Trump's desired changes. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Thursday that she intends to forge ahead with her approach to overhauling U.S. schools, declaring that the Obama administration's efforts to improve them had failed "miserably" and taking a swipe at journalists and critics who have called her ill-prepared for... Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Thursday that she intends to forge ahead with her approach to overhauling U.S. schools, declaring that the Obama administration's efforts to improve them had failed "miserably" and taking a swipe at journalists and critics who have called her ill-prepared for... Bannon framed much of Trump's agenda with the phrase, "deconstruction of the administrative state," meaning the system of taxes, regulations and trade pacts that the president says have stymied economic growth and infringed upon U.S. sovereignty. Bannon says that the post-World War II political and economic consensus is failing and should be replaced with a system that empowers ordinary people over coastal elites and international institutions. At the core, Bannon said in his remarks, is a belief that "we're a nation with an economy - not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being." Bannon repeatedly used the phrase "economic nationalism" and posited that Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement was "one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history." Nigel Farage, the British politician who led the successful Brexit movement in the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union, said in an interview at the conference that Bannon has the right vision to reorder world powers. Kellyanne Conway, the first woman to run a successful U.S. presidential campaign, said Thursday that she doesn't consider herself a feminist "in a classic sense" because the term is associated with being "anti-male" and "pro-abortion." Conway, who now serves as White House counselor to President... Kellyanne Conway, the first woman to run a successful U.S. presidential campaign, said Thursday that she doesn't consider herself a feminist "in a classic sense" because the term is associated with being "anti-male" and "pro-abortion." Conway, who now serves as White House counselor to President... "I've never met anyone in my life who has such focus and is so clear in the direction that he intends to go in," Farage said. "Steve is the person with an international perspective on all of this. He's got a good feel for the direction that he wants to see across the West." Bannon's language goes beyond Reagan-era Republican talking points about cutting regulations and lowering taxes. It also sidesteps key elements of the state that Trump has pledged to maintain or expand, such as the Defense Department, Medicare and Social Security, two huge federal entitlement programs. Bannon used some terms that are more often uttered along the political left or mainstream, such as "globalist" and "corporatist." Such words are rarely heard in a traditional Republican platform and underscore how Trump's populism and suspicion of the world economy are in some respects similar to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described democratic socialist. "They're corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed - adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has," Bannon said. Yet some of the most powerful officials crafting Trump's economic policies have deep roots in the global, corporate realm. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross was a billionaire investor; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was a hedge fund manager; and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was president of Goldman Sachs, to cite three. And all are being tasked with carrying out an agenda that includes standard GOP fare, from cutting taxes for the wealthy to rolling back banking regulations. Nonetheless, Bannon's appearance at CPAC signaled a profound shift in the conservative movement's center of gravity toward Trumpism. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, suggested during her appearance that by the time Trump addresses the group on Friday morning, the conference would be known as "TPAC." Bannon and Priebus were interviewed jointly on stage by Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC. Priebus celebrated Trump's administration as "the best Cabinet in the history of Cabinets," and Bannon said that many nominees "were selected for a reason, and that is deconstruction." Bannon has emerged in the minds of many Trump opponents as a mysterious and menacing puppeteer, portrayed as a harrowing Grim Reaper on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." He is best known for being the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative news site. Bannon once called Breitbart a "platform" for the alt-right, a small movement whose adherents are known for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view. Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland (D) said Bannon is a "dangerous person driven by an authoritarian ideology who, I fear, has more influence than anyone in the administration." "This is a mean, vicious, intolerant group," Strickland continued. "I've never seen anything like this in my political life." Bannon's path to the West Wing is complicated. Bannon, 63, grew up in a working-class household of Catholic Democrats in Richmond. He served in the Navy and then climbed the ladder in finance, graduating from Harvard Business School and working at Goldman Sachs. He then transformed his career and appearance, growing his hair long, dressing in black and becoming an antagonist to the global political and financial elite. A documentary filmmaker, Bannon championed former Alaska governor Sarah Palin as a conservative heroine. And he helped revamp Breitbart into a media colossus on the right that argues as much with the Republican establishment as it does with liberals. David Bossie, a longtime conservative strategist who was Trump's deputy campaign manager, said Bannon is "a modern-day Newt Gingrich." "He recognizes that the conservative movement over the last 10, 12 years has missed the sharp edge of the sword," Bossie said. "He will be that sword." After donning a dress shirt and tie Thursday morning for a White House meeting with corporate executives, Bannon changed into a black shirt (open collared, no tie), black blazer and khakis for his visit to CPAC. At one point, Priebus looked at Bannon and quipped, "I love how many collars he wears. Interesting look." Bannon and Priebus declared war against the media, taking their cues from the president, who tweeted last week that news organizations were "the enemy of the American People." "I think if you look at the opposition party and how they portray the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and now they're portraying the administration, it's always wrong," Bannon said, referring to the media as the opposition. Priebus agreed, saying that he thinks the biggest misconception about the Trump administration in its first month is "everything that you're reading." He and Bannon were defiant about their partnership, insisting that reports of power struggles were wrong. Priebus said he most admires Bannon's doggedness and loyalty, while Bannon said he appreciates Priebus's steady nature. "I can run a little hot on occasions, but Reince is indefatigable," Bannon said. "I mean, it's low-key, but it's determination." Still, Bannon's power center in the White House is quite different than that of Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman. Bannon has found a kindred spirit in Stephen Miller, the conservative ideologue who is Trump's senior policy adviser. One of his assistants is Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart immigration writer who was a fierce critic of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., one of Priebus's closest allies. The scene at CPAC reflected Bannon's sudden star status on the right. At the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at National Harbor, college Republicans spoke of him as an icon who embodied their own anger against political correctness on their university campuses. Writers for Breitbart, a main sponsor of CPAC, were treated as if they were ESPN anchors at a major sports event. Washington editor Matthew Boyle, who has scored several Trump interviews and counts Bannon as a mentor, was trailed by a photographer from a magazine that is profiling him. Bannon's trusted inner circle, including his public-relations adviser Alexandra Preate and GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, were followed by an entourage of aides and friends. They fielded questions about "Steve" - and not just from reporters. But the air of secrecy remained. "I don't comment on the record," Mercer said flatly.

President-elect Donald Trump and key advisers in recent days have backed away from some of the most sweeping pledges that the Republican candidate made on the campaign trail, suggesting that his administration may not deliver on promises that were important to his most fervent supporters. Trump built his campaign message around bold vows to, among other things, force Mexico to pay for a massive border wall, fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and ban Muslims from entering the United States. But in the days since his upset election victory, he or his advisers have suggested that those proposals and others may be subject to revision. On President Barack Obama's health care law, for example, Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday that he would like to keep some parts of the law intact and may seek to amend the statute rather than repeal it. Trump said he came to the conclusion after Obama, during Trump's Oval Office meeting Thursday, suggested areas of the law that should be preserved. Trump suggested provisions that prevent insurers from refusing coverage for pre-existing conditions and which allow children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26 should stay. "I like those very much," he said. The chant echoed through Donald Trump's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: "Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!" "We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests," the billionaire real... The chant echoed through Donald Trump's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: "Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!" "We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests," the billionaire real... In the same interview, Trump also avoided answering whether he would follow through on a campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. "It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform," he said. That ambivalent tone is a far cry from Trump's sweeping rhetoric on the campaign trail, where he repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace the ACA and led crowds in chants of "Lock her up!" in reference to Clinton. His lack of clarity on these and other issues has added more uncertainty to an already chaotic presidential transition, as he scrambles to build a team. There is also no guarantee that Trump will not return to his previous positions. In August, he appeared to consider softening his proposal to deport millions of people in this country illegally en masse, only to give a rousing speech retaining his hard-line stance. With little clarity from Trump himself, some of his surrogates and advisers have given a mixed view of what Trump will hope to accomplish in his first 100 days in office, discounting some of his most well-known proposals. A supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds an anti-Hillary Clinton sign as Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Henderson Pavilion on Oct. 5, 2016, in Henderson, Nev. A supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds an anti-Hillary Clinton sign as Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Henderson Pavilion on Oct. 5, 2016, in Henderson, Nev. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, cast doubt this week on whether the new president would seek to have Mexico fund Trump's proposed border wall -- a pledge that inspired regular chants of "Build that wall!" during campaign rallies. "He'll spend a lot of time controlling the border. He may not spend very much time trying to get Mexico to pay for it, but it was a great campaign device," Gingrich said Thursday during a conference call sponsored by Dentons, a global law firm. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a close adviser to Trump, sounded certain that the wall would be built -- but was far from clear about the timeline. He said during an interview on CNN Thursday that he believes Trump should prioritize tax reform in his first 100 days rather than issues like building the border wall. "The wall is going to take a while," Giuliani said. "Absolutely he's going to build it; it's a campaign promise. He's not going to break a campaign promise." On deportations, the campaign has yet to detail how many people in this country illegally might be targeted for immediate removal by the Trump administration. The number could range from 1 million to 6 million, according to various priorities Trump outlined over time throughout the campaign. During the GOP primaries, he repeatedly said that all of the estimated 11 million people in this country illegally would have to leave. Other proposals also carry constitutional and ethical implications. After calling for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" in 2015, Trump recast the idea this year as encompassing countries that have been "compromised by terrorism." He has not been clear about what is on the table now that he will be the president. After exiting a meeting with Republican leaders Thursday on Capitol Hill, Trump was asked by reporters to list his top three priorities after taking office. He mentioned securing the border, health-care reform and job creation. "Will you ask Congress to ban all Muslims from entering the country?" a reporter asked. Trump appeared to hear the question before thanking everybody and walking away. Trump said during the campaign that he would reinstate the use of waterboarding against terrorism suspects -- a practice that Congress made illegal after its use during the George W. Bush administration. But former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said this week that Trump's waterboarding remarks were just "campaign talk," according to CNN. The future president, who ran on an anti-establishment message, also faces pressure to accede to conservative orthodoxies that run counter to promises he made on the campaign trail. Speaking about the months ahead, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., signaled this week that he would consider cutting Medicare, arguing that the program "is going broke" and would need to be reformed at the same time Republicans repeal Obamacare. That, however, would contradict Trump's vows not to touch entitlement programs. Ryan has proposed turning Medicare into a "premium support" model, which would involve doling out federal subsidies for private insurance rather than the current single-payer model.

He was a disruptive rabble-rouser when it came to general demeanor and his immigration and national security stances. He... On international trade, it remains unclear whether Trump will follow through on his recommendations for punitive tariffs against China. Trump made a point throughout his campaign of trashing the Chinese for devaluing their currency, and said on occasion that he would put a tax on goods from China as a retaliation. "The tax should be 45 percent," he told The New York Times in January, a figure he used on several occasions. But senior policy adviser Wilbur Ross, who has consulted with Trump on his first 100 days, sought to walk back those campaign claims during an interview this week with Yahoo Finance, denying that Trump had made the suggestion. "He's been misquoted about the 45 percent on China. Everybody says, 'Oh, he's going to slap 45 percent tariff on everything out of China.' That's not what he said, and it's not what he intends," Ross said. "What he actually said was if it turns out that the Chinese yuan is 45 percent overvalued, or as much as 45, and if they won't negotiate with us, then it may become necessary as a negotiating measure to threaten them with as much as a 45 percent tariff." Trump has railed against the Iranian nuclear deal, promising to undo and renegotiate the agreement as it currently stands. In October, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said a Trump administration would "rip up the Iran deal." But Trump's advisers have been vaguer on the topic this week. " 'Ripping up' is maybe a too strong of word. He's gonna take that agreement, it's been done before in international context, and then review it," Trump adviser Walid Phares told the BBC Thursday. "He will take the agreement, review it, send it to Congress, demand from Iranians to restore few issues or change few issues. And there will be a discussion; it could be a tense discussion."

Trump indicated this year that he would move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, which his campaign said in a statement was "the eternal capital of the Jewish People" that must be recognized "as the undivided capital of the state of Israel." Phares hedged during the BBC interview and said that Trump had committed to doing it only "through consensus." Palestinian leaders would not support such a plan. But Trump adviser David Friedman told the Jerusalem Post on Wednesday, "It was a campaign promise, and there is every intention to keep it."

Donald Trump is considering a conservative bomb-thrower and the face of the GOP establishment, among others, for White House chief of staff — a major post that could set the direction for his presidency. The Republican president-elect is days away from naming his chief of staff, according to people with direct knowledge of his thinking. No position is considered more important than chief of staff, a behind-the-scenes power player who typically controls access to the president, guides the enactment of his policy priorities and oversees White House hiring. Trump has already narrowed his list to a handful of high-profile loyalists that includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, campaign CEO Steve Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. The incoming president repeatedly vowed to "drain the swamp" during his campaign's final weeks, yet both Priebus and Conway have operated for years in that same Washington "swamp." Bannon, by contrast, would represent a dramatically different direction, having spent recent years leading a conservative news site that fueled conspiracy theories popular with the "alt-right" movement of white nationalists.

Chris Christie on Friday amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual... Trump ran as an outsider, but some suggest it would be risky to tap another outsider to serve as his right hand in the Oval Office. "I'm trying to think of who was successful as chief of staff as an outsider and I can't think of one," said John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as chief of staff for the first three years of former President George H.W. Bush's administration. A president's chief of staff sets the tone for the White House, guarding who has access to the president and what problems land on his desk. The role blends both policy and politics, working with congressional lawmakers and Cabinet officials. The chief of staff is also typically among the closest advisers to the president, providing counsel on domestic and foreign policy decisions. In 2013, President Barack Obama made the decision to abruptly pull back plans to launch airstrikes on Syria while walking on the South Lawn with his chief of staff, Denis McDonough. The chief of staff "is often the last person who speaks to a president before a decision is made," said Sara Fagen, who worked under two chiefs of staff in the George W. Bush White House. "This person has to have the confidence of the president and they have to have the kind of relationship with the president where they can give him candid advice and tell him things he does not want to hear."

Senator Cardin says this is necessary under the Constitution's Emoluments Clause. Nov. 29, 2016. (C-SPAN) It's also helpful, Sununu said, if the chief of staff "understands the nuances and the politics of policy so that the president doesn't accidently get himself into a bind." There are few people in Trump's inner circle who are experienced in the nuances of politics and policy. The businessman and reality television star is expected to lean heavily on Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a sitting governor who previously served in Congress for more than a decade. But with Trump having been shunned by most of the political world's most respected leaders for much of the last year, few of his closest campaign advisers have governing experience in Washington. Trump has only about 70 days to form a new government, including hundreds of senior-level employees across various federal agencies. The jobs — and the selection of his Cabinet — will be filled only after a chief of staff is selected. And with so many questions about Trump's specific priorities as president, his early personnel decisions become major signals of his intentions. "Personnel is policy," said Republican operative Ron Kaufman, who also served in the H.W. Bush's White House. The leading candidates for chief of staff include Priebus, who has served as chairman of the Republican National Committee since 2011. The Wisconsin native is close friends with House Speaker Paul Ryan and also popular among RNC members. He thrived as a fundraiser as the GOP chairman and led the party's voter outreach efforts that helped fuel Trump's stunning victory. Priebus has no governing experience. He became the national chairman after serving as chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Preibus is perhaps Trump's most trusted member of the GOP establishment, having traveled with him often during the campaign's final weeks. Bannon joined the Trump campaign in August after a second major staffing shakeup. He has little national profile, but became well-known among Washington's conservative fringe as the combative head of Breitbart News, a pro-Trump website that frequently targeted Republican leaders like Ryan and promotes false conspiracy theories. Russian government officials had contacts with members of Donald Trump's campaign team, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday, in a disclosure that could reopen scrutiny over the Kremlin's role in the president-elect's bitter race against Hillary Clinton.

She was viewed as an effective messenger on cable television and was largely credited with helping to keep Trump focused on his Democratic opponent in the campaign's final days. She previously led a "super PAC" that supported Ted Cruz's presidential bid and was funded by the Mercer family, who would later become prominent Trump backers. Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, to head their transition team, abruptly replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual step of naming his three oldest children and his son-in-law to top posts, moves certain to create potential conflicts of interest given that his attorney said Trump would put his children in charge of his assets while he is president. The transition team is always crucial, but especially so for the first president elected without experience in either government or the military. In addition to recruiting thousands of people to staff the White House, Cabinet agencies, embassies and other key government posts, the transition team needs to make sure Trump is briefed and prepared to take responsibility for the government and for implementing his policy initiatives as soon as he is inaugurated in just 76 days. “You need to have your team on the field when the clock starts," said Max Stier, who heads the Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on good-government practices. "This is not simply about achieving the policy promises; it’s also about keeping us safe. Transitions are the point of maximum vulnerability for our nation." The effort is almost always well underway before a new president is elected, given the complexity and critical nature of the job, even as candidates know the work will be in vain if they are not chosen by the voters. Legislation passed in 2010, and updated in 2015, formalized much of the process for the transition from George W. Bush to Obama after the 2008 election, considered one of the smoothest in history. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton formed transition teams months ago that began working with the White House on first steps toward a potential handoff. Several hundred well-wishers and a high school band greeted Republican Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Thursday night when he triumphantly returned to Indiana for the first time since Tuesday's election. Fire trucks sprayed streams of water in the air over Pence's plane before it came to a rest... Several hundred well-wishers and a high school band greeted Republican Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Thursday night when he triumphantly returned to Indiana for the first time since Tuesday's election. Fire trucks sprayed streams of water in the air over Pence's plane before it came to a rest... “One of the biggest dangers is that people will underestimate the scope,” said former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who ran Mitt Romney's transition team in 2012. That may have happened in Trump’s case. Following Trump’s meeting Thursday at the White House with the president, several Obama officials privately noted the extent to which Trump and his staff seemed unprepared to discuss basic aspects of staffing a new administration and daunted by the extent of the challenges ahead. A follow-up meeting between Trump aides and White House transition officials scheduled for Friday was canceled, a senior Obama aide said. To be sure, some of the observations made by White House officials could be colored by partisan differences or concern that Trump appears set to dismantle Obama’s legacy achievements. Many had counted on a smoother transition to a Clinton administration in which top personnel would likely include former coworkers. Trump’s decision to elevate Pence to run his transition team was one of several announced Friday. Pence has proved a loyal second to Trump, backing him when other establishment Republicans were critical and finding ways to explain some of his more controversial statements in public. A former member of the House, Pence also has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other top Republicans on Capitol Hill. Christie’s departure came after the recent convictions of two former top aides for creating a traffic jam leading to the George Washington Bridge to punish a mayor who would not endorse him to be reelected New Jersey governor. Donald Trump won the presidency by pledging to restore a vanished and golden economic era, when growth roared, factory jobs flourished and America sat unchallenged atop the global economy. Yet he never offered much of a roadmap. Which is why it's far from clear how Trump will affect the economy,... Donald Trump won the presidency by pledging to restore a vanished and golden economic era, when growth roared, factory jobs flourished and America sat unchallenged atop the global economy. Yet he never offered much of a roadmap. Which is why it's far from clear how Trump will affect the economy,... “The mission of our team will be clear: Put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,” Trump said. “Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation.” Christie was retained as a vice chair of the team, along with several of Trump’s most visible campaign advisors: Dr. Ben Carson, a former GOP primary rival; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). Sessions, who may be the most hard-line member of the Senate on immigration, has long been among Trump’s most influential advisors. Stephen Miller, a former top aide to Sessions, has been Trump’s top policy advisor and will take a similar role in the transition team. Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, was named as the executive director for the transition team. The team also includes Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s campaign chief who is on leave from heading the arch-conservative Breitbart News. Several prominent business people, including Peter Thiel, one of the only major figures in Silicon Valley to endorse Trump, were named, as was Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general who solicited and accepted a $25,000 campaign donation from Trump’s family foundation in 2013, four days after Bondi said her office was considering joining a New York state probe of Trump University. Rep. Devin Nunes, the Tulare Republican who leads the House Select Intelligence Committee, was also given a top spot. He could be a key bridge for Trump and the intelligence community, which has been reluctant to rally behind Trump.

Trump’s children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who guided him throughout the campaign, appear to have retained their influence in an official capacity. Kushner’s presence at the White House on Thursday drew notice from Obama’s staff when he asked, as they toured the West Wing, how many of the individuals there would remain into the next administration. Nearly all will depart along with the president. Briefing reporters Friday about the president’s trip next week to Greece, Germany and Peru, Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security advisor, repeatedly referred to the imperative of fully educating the incoming administration about the major foreign policy issues Trump will face. "The main focus of the conversation [between Trump and Obama] ... was determining how to make the best use of this transition period to fully brief up the president-elect and his team," he said. "There’s a great deal of complexity." Trump’s spokespeople did not respond to calls and emails asking about his preparation. Passages on Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov, were copied from the site of the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonprofit that had consulted with both campaigns about the transition, Politico reported. “It’s in everybody’s interest to have a good transition,” said Martha Kumar, the director of the White House Transition Project. “We’re living in a world of great vulnerability. You can’t afford to not prepare well.” Los Angeles Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. Twitter: @noahbierman, @mikememoli and @cparsons

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday evening its website would be "undergoing changes" to better represent the new direction the agency is taking, triggering the removal of several agency websites containing detailed climate data and scientific information. One of the websites that appeared to be gone had been cited to challenge statements made by the EPA's new administrator, Scott Pruitt. Another provided detailed information on the previous administration's Clean Power Plan, including fact sheets about greenhouse gas emissions on the state and local levels and how different demographic groups were affected by such emissions. The changes came less than 24 hours before thousands of protesters were set to march in Washington and around the country in support of political action to push back against the Trump administration's rollbacks of former president Barack Obama's climate policies. "As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land, and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency," J.P. Freire, the agency's associate administrator for public affairs, said in a statement. "We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we're protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law." The agency also said it would carefully archive pages from the past administration. Yet the website overhaul appears to include not only policy-related changes, but also scrutiny of a scientific Web page that has existed for nearly two decades, and that explained what climate change is and how it worked. The EPA's extensive climate change website now redirects to a page that says "this page is being updated" and that "we are currently updating our website to reflect EPA's priorities under the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Pruitt." It also links to a full archive of how the page used to look on Jan. 19, before Trump's inauguration. The archive notes, in a key section under the "causes of climate change," that Recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. It is this language, when the site was still up, that directly contradicted Pruitt. Pruitt had argued on CNBC last month that "measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." Most employees at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shy away from the public spotlight, focusing instead on the behind-the-scenes work of enforcing laws intended to protect public health and wildlife. Then Donald Trump became president. Even before Trump introduced a budget last month that... Most employees at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shy away from the public spotlight, focusing instead on the behind-the-scenes work of enforcing laws intended to protect public health and wildlife. Then Donald Trump became president. Even before Trump introduced a budget last month that... The EPA's climate change website stated otherwise, and did so by citing findings of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There had been reports early in the Trump administration that the EPA climate change website was set to be taken down, but in the end it did not happen immediately. The page contains scientific explanations of climate change and its causes and consequences, and has existed in one form or another since the Clinton administration. At that time it was called the agency's Global Warming site. The site has long served an informational role and sought to provide a comprehensive review of basic climate science, the effects of climate change, and how it is affecting the United States. In addition it contained information about the agency's approach to climate change and how people could take steps to lower their own contributions to climate change. However, the site has run into political difficulties before. Under President George W. Bush, updates to the site were frozen and then required to undergo White House review. However, this process did not lead to substantive changes in scientific content. In its press statement, the EPA said that when it comes to website changes, "the first page to be updated is a page reflecting President Trump's Executive Order on Energy Independence, which calls for a review of the so-called Clean Power Plan." That site, www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan, now redirects to https://www.epa.gov/Energy-Independence, which features an image of President Trump signing an executive order aimed at dismantling the power plant rule and other Obama-era climate regulations. In the statement, Freire said that "language associated with the Clean Power Plan, written by the last administration, is out-of-date. Similarly, content related to climate and regulation is also under review." In a Trump administration beset by lost opportunities, muddled strategies and frequent missteps in its first 100 days, one area stands out for its disciplined approach and early successes: the multi-front assault on environmental regulations. Unlike the Obamacare repeal debacle or immigration actions... In a Trump administration beset by lost opportunities, muddled strategies and frequent missteps in its first 100 days, one area stands out for its disciplined approach and early successes: the multi-front assault on environmental regulations. Unlike the Obamacare repeal debacle or immigration actions... Several career EPA employees, who asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution, said they were not briefed in advance about the decision to alter the agency's site. "People are obviously unhappy," one employee said. "It is, in my opinion, the best climate education website out there." David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program for the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, tweeted Friday, "Cleansing has begun. EPA website scrubbed of pages on "so-called" Clean Power Plan. Now only alternative facts." Another EPA website, documenting climate change "indicators" across the United States, remained up on Friday.

The March for Science is not a partisan event. But it's political. That's the recurring message of the organizers, who insist that this is a line the scientific community and its supporters will be able to walk. It may prove too delicate a distinction, though, when people show up in droves on Saturday with their signs and their passions. "We've been asked not to make personal attacks or partisan attacks," said honorary national co-chair Lydia Villa-Komaroff, in a teleconference this week with reporters. But Villa-Komaroff, who will be among those given two-minute speaking slots, quickly added: "This is a group of people who don't take well being told what to do." The Science March, held on Earth Day, is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the Mall, and satellite marches have been planned in more than 400 cities on six continents. The crowd will gather on Saturday near the Washington Monument for five hours of speeches and teach-ins, culminating in the march at 2 p.m. The march will follow Constitution Avenue along the north edge of the Mall to the foot of Capitol Hill. Protest marches may be common in Washington these days, but one centered on the value of science is unprecedented. The march is part of a wave of activism in the scientific community. Scientists are jumping into the political fray by running for public office - such as in southern California, where geologist Jess Phoenix, a Democrat, has announced her candidacy for a congressional seat held by a Republican. Many mainstream science organizations - such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Chemical Society - have signed on, despite their lack of experience in going to the barricades. Rush Holt, head of AAAS, said there was initial hesitation about whether this was the kind of event a scientist ought to be joining but that members of his association overwhelmingly support the decision to participate. This is not simply a reaction to President Donald Trump's election, Holt said. Scientists have been worried for years that "evidence has been crowded out by ideology and opinion in public debate and policymaking." Long before Trump's election, people in the scientific and academic community raised concerns about the erosion of the value of expertise and the rise of pseudoscientific and anti-scientific notions. Science also found itself swept up into cultural and political battles; views on climate science, for example, increasingly reflect political ideology. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Michigan pediatrician who sounded the alarm on lead in Flint's drinking water, is one of the march's honorary co-chairs. Her experience as a physician in Flint paved the way for her science advocacy, Hanna-Attisha told The Post. "Pediatricians care for a population that can't speak, can't vote," she said, noting that doctors take an oath to protect patients from harm. "It is your role to be an advocate." Organizers have announced a route for the March for Science Chicago that will coincide with the national march on Earth Day.

Organizers have announced a route for the March for Science Chicago that will coincide with the national march on Earth Day. Scheduled for April 22, the local march was propelled by the regional science community's apprehension about President Donald Trump's presidency and his plans to make severe... The line up for the event on the Mall includes some of science's biggest names. Bill Nye, CEO of the Planetary Society and another honorary co-chair, will speak, as will climate scientist Michael Mann and NASA Astronaut Leland Melvin. The musician Questlove is slated to give a performance. Notably, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the most well-known living American scientist, will not be attending a science march, according to a representative. Tyson did not respond to a request to comment on why. No politicians have been invited to participate in the march, organizers say, even as they acknowledge that this was inspired by the Women's March on the day after Trump's inauguration. "Science is nonpartisan. That's the reason that we respect it, because it aims to reduce bias. That's why we have the scientific method. We felt very strongly that having politicians involved would skew that in some way," Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and co-organizer of the march, said at the National Press Club earlier this month. Carol Greider, a Johns Hopkins molecular biologist and Nobel laureate, said in the conference call this week that she will bring dozens of students and postdoctoral researchers to the march. "People are actually questioning whether they can even go on and have a career in science," she said, noting the Trump administration's proposal to cut nearly a fifth of the National Institutes of Health budget. "Potentially, we will lose an entire generation of people who are now trained and have the talent and are eager to make the next breakthroughs." Greider said it's possible to fight for science without "labeling ourselves" as being on one partisan side or the other. That was echoed by Elias Zerhouni, former NIH head under President George W. Bush: "This is not a partisan issue. This is not one administration versus another. . . . It's really an age-old debate between rational approaches to the universe and irrational approaches to the universe." Not every scientist is convinced. Arthur Lambert, a cancer researcher at the Whitehead Institute at MIT in Boston, said he was initially excited about the science march. But as the event drew closer, it seemed increasingly unlikely that it would appear to be anything but partisan. "It's a bad idea to align all of science against any political administration," Lambert said. "I don't think that's their goal . . . But it runs that risk, especially after such a heated election." Recent political developments in Washington are among the primary drivers of this march. Before he became president, Trump promoted anti-scientific theories. He tweeted in 2012, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." He echoed the fully discredited notion that there is a link between vaccines and autism. During the presidential transition he reportedly discussed with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the possibility of creating a vaccine safety commission. To run the Environmental Protection Agency, he appointed Scott Pruitt, who as Oklahoma attorney general had sued the agency many times and who, during an interview in March, said he did not believe that human activity is a primary driver of the observed climate change - a statement at odds with scientific research. The looming March for Science, which arose in great part as protest to President Donald Trump, has a lot of people saying: “Wait, I thought scientists are supposed to be apolitical.” Actually, long before researchers openly criticized Trump’s policies on climate change and other issues, the scientific... The looming March for Science, which arose in great part as protest to President Donald Trump, has a lot of people saying: “Wait, I thought scientists are supposed to be apolitical.” Actually, long before researchers openly criticized Trump’s policies on climate change and other issues, the scientific... The entry ban pushed in the early days of the administration, and associated rhetoric about building walls and restricting immigration, alarmed many leaders of science-related institutions that rely on the expertise of foreign nationals (at MIT, for example, 40 percent of the faculty was born outside the United States, according to the university's president). The administration has not taken some actions initially feared by the scientific community. One fear was that climate data would be deleted or sabotaged; that hasn't happened. The EPA's website continues to describe climate change as largely driven by human activities. Trump has yet to appoint anyone to several key science-related posts. He has not picked a White House science adviser. He hasn't nominated anyone to run NASA or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the U.S. Geological Survey. He has let Francis Collins stay on an interim basis as head of the NIH, though it's not clear that Collins will be permanently retained. Public health positions are unoccupied that are crucial for responding to a global pandemic, a disaster every president since Ronald Reagan has faced. Behind the scenes at the March for Science, there has been internal controversy about inclusiveness and diversity, and whether social justice should be central to the march's messaging. On social media, a number of scientists have said they are skipping the march because they think the organizers haven't focused enough on racism, sexism, and the scientific community's centuries-long history of marginalizing women and people of color. Meanwhile, conservatives have derided the march as a political enterprise in which what's being advocated is not science, exactly, but left-leaning policies, such as the Obama administration's environmental regulations designed to curb carbon emissions. But for most of those who will come to Washington or other cities on Saturday, the march is a chance to show solidarity, enjoy witty protest signs, and stick up for evidence and reason. And not all of them will be scientists. Dennis Moore, a patrol cop at the Cherry Hill, N.J. Police Department, said he's marching to make the point that science benefits everyone. "I've always been kind of a nerd," he said, mentioning that he was wearing a flux capacitor t-shirt as he spoke. "Science is our best tool for understanding the world around us . . . but I think we're basically just de-emphasizing science in our lives and in our communities." Moore lives in New Jersey, but he and his wife will be visiting Boston on Saturday on a trip to celebrate their anniversary, and Moore plans to stop by the local science march while they're there. How does his wife feel about that? "Great!" He laughed. "She's pretty nerdy too."

In his drive to dismantle President Barack Obama's regulatory legacy, President Donald Trump has signed executive orders with great fanfare and breathed life into a once-obscure law to nullify numerous Obama-era regulations. But his administration is also quietly using a third tactic: Going to court to stop federal judges from ruling on a broad array of regulations that are being challenged by Trump's own conservative allies. These cases were filed long before the election. Now, Trump administration officials, eager to flip the government position, want judges to put the cases on hold and give federal agencies time to revise or shrink the Obama-era regulatory regime. Trump officials are also asking judges to keep any existing stays in place so that the contested regulations do not go into effect while the new administration mulls its deregulatory strategy. Much is at stake. The Environmental Protection Agency persuaded an appeals court to give it a chance to revise existing limits on street-level smog. The EPA also wants a court to let it rewrite the Clean Power Plan that Obama showcased at the 2015 Paris climate conference. And the Justice Department has sought to review a Health and Human Services regulation that prohibits health-care providers from discriminating against people on the basis of gender identity, sex stereotyping or the termination of a pregnancy. Amid the turmoil over staff shake-ups, blocked travel bans and the Russia cloud hanging overhead, President Donald Trump is steadily plugging away at a major piece of his agenda: Undoing Obama. From abortion to energy to climate change and personal investments, Trump is keeping his promises in... Amid the turmoil over staff shake-ups, blocked travel bans and the Russia cloud hanging overhead, President Donald Trump is steadily plugging away at a major piece of his agenda: Undoing Obama. From abortion to energy to climate change and personal investments, Trump is keeping his promises in... The legal strategy is a critical part of the administration's battle to reverse rules enacted in the final years of Obama's tenure. For the Trump administration, getting the regulations back for reconsideration is also the surest way to stave off court rulings — especially those from liberal-leaning benches — that could hinder its ability to unwind rules adopted by the previous administration. "If the courts uphold the previous administration, you still have the discretion to change things, but you've lost the argument that you were forced to do it or that the previous administration exceeded legal bounds," said Richard Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard University. He said that if Trump officials "were confident the courts would rule against" the Obama rules, "you wouldn't see them trying to hold cases in abeyance." Two beaches at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore had to be closed Tuesday and the National Park Service announced that "people and their pets should have no contact with the water of Lake Michigan or Burns Waterway in the West Beach and Portage Lakefront areas." The problem wasn't the familiar... Two beaches at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore had to be closed Tuesday and the National Park Service announced that "people and their pets should have no contact with the water of Lake Michigan or Burns Waterway in the West Beach and Portage Lakefront areas." The problem wasn't the familiar... While some presidents — including Obama — have used this legal tactic in the past, Trump has expanded on the strategy. When Obama took office, his administration asked federal courts to hold in abeyance at least half a dozen cases regarding EPA regulations and permits, saying it needed more time to decide whether to defend, revoke or revise the matters. This time, however, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is calling on courts to send back rules that he had sought to overturn while serving as Oklahoma's attorney general before taking up his current post two months ago. "The Trump team is trying a shortcut," said David Doniger, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who has been a leading defender of the Clean Power Plan. He said that because the Supreme Court has issued a stay in the power plan case, the Trump administration could effectively kill the plan with a prolonged reconsideration without going through the established guidelines for undoing a rule. But administration backers note that Democrats and Republicans alike have deployed this legal strategy. "This is actually pretty routine," Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer at the Bracewell law and lobbying firm and an EPA official under President George W. Bush, said in an email. "When the Obama Administration [officials] took office, there were a number of Bush Administration rules being challenged that they didn't want to defend." Lawyers on both sides say fundamental principles are at stake. Before Trump's election, lawyers for the states challenging the Clean Power Plan said that basic federalism meant that the federal government cannot compel states to undertake potentially costly energy programs. But lawyers for environmental groups say legislation adopted by Congress gives the federal government the power and obligation to set limits on emissions from power plants while paying attention to states' rights in designing plans to carry that out. Some liberals have used federalist arguments to block Trump initiatives, such as the Trump administration's efforts to compel cities to implement immigration laws by threatening to cut their federal funding. In some cases, the Trump administration has made a court case moot, such as when the Justice and Education departments rescinded guidance that informed school districts that they had to accommodate students' access to facilities based on their chosen gender identities. In another case, the Justice Department asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 4 for more time to respond to a lawsuit challenging the HHS regulation on health-care providers and discrimination. The rule reflects the previous administration's interpretation of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and was challenged by five states as well as several religious groups who said it represented federal overreach and should have included a carve-out for religiously affiliated medical providers. A federal judge in Texas stopped two provisions of the rule, pertaining to gender identity and the termination of a pregnancy, from taking effect Jan. 1, while other aspects of it were allowed to go forward. "Certainly, asking for additional time can be a very strong signal that the administration intends to change course on the subject of litigation," said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign. "That's very concerning to us." The most frequent use of the strategy involves Obama-era environmental regulations. The Clean Power Plan court battle is one of the highest-profile cases. The plan was issued by the Obama EPA on Aug. 3, 2015. A group of 28 states — led by Pruitt — sued to block the plan, and that case has been argued before a full 10-member panel of the liberal-leaning Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On Feb. 9, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay preventing the plan from going into effect while it makes its way through the appeals court. Now the EPA wants the appellate court to hand the regulation back without ruling on it. "They've filed a motion asking the 10-judge panel to hold the case in 'abeyance' — i.e., put it in the deep freeze — and thus not to issue its decision, until the Administration is done with its multi-year review and rulemaking," Doniger said. "They're saying whatever you do, don't decide anything." Pressing deadlines have pushed the administration to take action. On April 11, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the EPA's request to delay a long-scheduled April 19 hearing in cases challenging standards used to limit ground-level ozone, which is formed when emissions from industrial facilities and vehicles interact with sunlight and is linked to lung and heart ailments, including asthma. "We are thankful to the court for granting our motion to postpone oral argument," said EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said in an email, adding that it would allow the agency to ensure the rule's "broad implications ... in light of President Trump's pro-growth agenda." The EPA has also asked a three-judge appeals court panel to hold in abeyance a challenge to the agency's rules that new power plants meet carbon dioxide emissions standards. A Trump executive order directs the EPA to rewrite that standard. Oral arguments scheduled for April 17 have been postponed. The EPA rule designed to stop the pollution of tributaries of major rivers is in the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. The Obama administration already filed a brief in the case, a roughly 170-page defense of the law and science that it said justified the rule. The case was postponed because the Supreme Court wanted to rule on a narrow jurisdictional issue. Here, too, the Trump EPA wants to "review and rescind or revise" the rule. The Interior Department indicated in court filings in mid-March that it planned to withdraw a 2015 rule restricting hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, which had been stayed in court; less than two weeks later, Trump issued an executive order calling for the rule to be rewritten. While some departments, such as the EPA and Interior, have asked the courts to return contested rules to them so they can take a second look, others — including the Labor Department, which still does not have a secretary in place — have not. Many business officials, who have challenged some of the Obama-era rules, said they support the new administration reclaiming the regulations. "If the courts rule in favor of the rule that was issued [under Obama], it would be allowed to go into effect," said Dan Bosch, senior manager of regulatory policy for the National Federation of Independent Business, in an interview. Bosch noted that not only would his group's members have to start spending money to comply with the existing rule, but also, "at that point, it's a lot of harder to make it go away." David Weil, who headed the Labor Department's wage and hour division under Obama, said in an interview that he hoped the legal challenge to the federal overtime rule continued because he believed it will be upheld. That rule, which was issued last year, is subject to a nationwide injunction. "I do feel very confident in the regulation," said Weil, now a Boston University professor of management. "It was a responsible use of our regulatory authority."

Congressional negotiators on Tuesday inched toward a potential agreement on a catchall spending bill that would deny President Donald Trump's request for immediate funding to construct a wall along the Mexico border. The emerging measure would increase the defense budget and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown on Trump's 100th day in office this Saturday. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Republican negotiators were following the lead of Trump, who signaled Monday evening that he would not insist on $1 billion worth of wall funding now as an addition to the $1 trillion-plus spending bill. Trump told a gathering of conservative media reporters that he might be willing to wait until September for the funding. Other stumbling blocks remain, but the decision by Trump and his GOP allies to back down on the wall steered the talks on the spending measure in a positive direction. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was optimistic the talks would produce "an agreement in the next few days." An existing temporary funding bill expires Friday at midnight and all sides anticipated that another stopgap measure would be required to buy time for the House and Senate to process the massive spending bill, which would wrap together 11 unfinished agency spending bills through September. Trump campaigned throughout the country last year promising a wall across the entire 2,200 mile southern border, promising that Mexico would pay for it. But while the idea is a priority of Trump's most fervent supporters, it is resolutely opposed by Democrats and even many Republicans, who see it as wasteful and who prefer other steps like new technologies and additional border agents to curb illegal immigration. Sure enough, the big trans-Pacific trade deal is toast, climate change action is on the ropes and various regulations from the Obama era have been scrapped. It's also a safe bet President Donald Trump hasn't raced a bicycle since Jan. 20, keeping that vow. Add a Supreme Court justice — no small... Sure enough, the big trans-Pacific trade deal is toast, climate change action is on the ropes and various regulations from the Obama era have been scrapped. It's also a safe bet President Donald Trump hasn't raced a bicycle since Jan. 20, keeping that vow. Add a Supreme Court justice — no small... "I support additional border security funding," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a GOP critic of Trump who dined with the president Monday at the White House. "But a 2,200-mile wall, I don't think there's a whole lot of support for it." Trump vowed to fight for the wall. "The wall is going to get built," he said at the White House Tuesday. Asked when, he said, "Soon." Democrats vowed not to give up, either, and look forward to the fight. "It's not a negotiation," Schumer said. "No wall." Meanwhile, Trump appeared poised to procure about $15 billion to boost the military. Democrats said they were satisfied with the emerging outlines of the measure, which stick closely to versions of the legislation that were being negotiated late last year. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., observed that GOP negotiators "have simply ignored" a roster of "$18 billion in extreme cuts" offered by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to lower the measure's cost. The measure would also maintain foreign aid accounts that Trump has targeted, along with a series of grant programs popular with lawmakers in both parties, such as community development block grants.

For nearly 100 days, President Donald Trump has rattled Washington and been chastened by its institutions. He's startled world leaders with his unpredictability and tough talk, but won their praise for a surprise strike on Syria. He's endured the steady drip of investigations and a seemingly endless... Several issues remain unresolved. Democrats, with McConnell's help, were pushing to extend health benefits for 22,000 retired Appalachian coal miners and their families whose medical coverage is set to expire at the end of April. Democrats faced White House opposition in an uphill battle to give Puerto Rico help with its Medicaid commitment, while Republicans are pressing policy "riders" to undo new Obama-era financial regulations. Another potential stumbling block involved a recent threat by Trump to scuttle a portion of former President Barack Obama's health law that helps low-income people afford insurance policies. Democratic votes are invariably needed to pass catchall spending bills, which typically are resented by many tea party Republicans. That gave Democratic leaders like Schumer and Pelosi significant leverage, and the top Democrats had earlier this month taken a hard line in response to Trump's threats to deny the Obamacare payments for out-of-pocket costs for the poor, injecting the issue into the spending bill talks. Schumer, however, backpedaled on Tuesday and would no longer insist that the issue be addressed in the catchall bill and the White House sent conciliatory signals as well. Meanwhile, House lawmakers returned to Washington Tuesday evening and faced a renewed push from the White House to revive their beleaguered health care bill in hopes of attracting enough votes to finally push it through the House. Leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus met to consider a proposal to change the GOP legislation to let states get federal waivers to ignore coverage requirements imposed by President Barack Obama's health care law. These include a prohibition against insurers charging higher premiums for seriously ill customers. The plan "has real merits worthy of consideration for all the Freedom Caucus folks," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of that group. He helped craft the idea with Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a leader of a group of GOP moderates. Meadows and numerous conservatives and moderates opposed an initial version of the bill, forcing House leaders to withdraw the measure before a planned vote last month. GOP leaders are trying to determine if the proposed changes can gain enough votes to pass, but that remains uncertain.

For nearly 100 days, President Donald Trump has rattled Washington and been chastened by its institutions. He's startled world leaders with his unpredictability and tough talk, but won their praise for a surprise strike on Syria. He's endured the steady drip of investigations and a seemingly endless churn of public personnel drama. "It's a different kind of a presidency," Trump said in an Oval Office interview with The Associated Press, an hour-long conversation as he approached Saturday's key presidential benchmark. Trump, who campaigned on a promise of instant disruption, indirectly acknowledged that change doesn't come quickly to Washington. He showed signs that he feels the weight of the office, discussing the "heart" required to do the job. Although he retained his signature bravado and a salesman's confidence in his upward trajectory, he displayed an understanding that many of his own lofty expectations for his first 100 days in office have not been met. "It's an artificial barrier. It's not very meaningful," he said. Trump waffled on whether he should be held accountable for the 100-day plan he outlined with great fanfare in his campaign's closing days, suggesting his "Contract with the American Voter" wasn't really his idea to begin with. "Somebody put out the concept of a 100-day plan," he said. One hundred days are just a fraction of a president's tenure, and no president has quite matched the achievements of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who set the standard by which all are now judged. Still, modern presidents have tried to move swiftly to capitalize upon the potent, and often fleeting, mix of political capital and public goodwill that usually accompanies their arrival in Washington. Trump has never really had either. A deeply divisive figure, he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton and had one of the narrower Electoral College victories in history. Since taking office on Jan. 20, his approval rating has hovered around 40 percent in most polls. Trump's early presidency has been dogged by FBI and congressional investigations into whether his campaign coordinated with Russians to tilt the race in his favor. It's a persistent distraction that Trump would not discuss on the record. Furthermore, his three months-plus in office have amounted to a swift education in a world wholly unfamiliar to a 70-year-old who spent his career in real estate and reality television. For example, his two disputed travel ban executive orders are languishing, blocked by federal judges. On Capitol Hill, majority Republicans muscled through Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, but had to blow up long-standing Senate rules to do so. Then there was the legislative debacle when Trump's own party couldn't come together to fulfill its long-sought promise of repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. H.W. Brands, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Trump is learning that "the world is the way it is for a whole bunch of complicated reasons. And changing the guy at the top doesn't change the world." Trump won't concede that point. But he acknowledged that being commander in chief brings with it a "human responsibility" that he didn't much bother with in business, requiring him to think through the consequences his decisions have on people and not simply the financial implications for his company's bottom line. "When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria," Trump said of his decision to strike a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. "I'm saying to myself, 'You know, this is more than just like 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that's involved because people could have been killed. This is risk that's involved.'" "Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government involves heart, whereas in business most things don't involve heart," he said. "In fact, in business you're actually better off without it." As for accomplishments, Trump cited "tremendous success" on an undefined strategy for defeating the Islamic State group. He talked at length about saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars on the price of F-35 fighter jets. Trump held meetings during the transition and in the White House with the CEO of Lockheed Martin, which produces the F-35, but the cost-savings were already in the works when he took office. He promised a tax overhaul plan that would give Americans a tax cut bigger than "any tax cut ever." A man accustomed to wealth and its trappings, Trump has embraced life in the Executive Mansion, often regaling guests with trivia about the historic decor. With the push of a red button placed on the Resolute Desk that presidents have used for decades, a White House butler soon arrived with a Coke for the president. It's too soon to say whether the presidency has changed Trump in substantive ways. He's backpedaled on an array of issues in recent weeks, including his critiques of NATO and his threats to label China a currency manipulator. But his self-proclaimed flexibility means he could move back to where he started just as quickly. Stylistically, Trump remains much the same as during the campaign. He fires off tweets at odd hours of the morning and night, sending Washington into a stir with just a few words. Trump still litigates the presidential campaign, mentioning multiple times during the interview how difficult it is for a Republican presidential nominee to win the Electoral College. He is acutely aware of how he's being covered in the media, rattling off the ratings for some of his television appearances. But he says he's surprised even himself with some recent self-discipline: He's stopped watching what he perceives as his negative coverage on CNN and MSNBC, he said. "I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability," he said. "I always thought I'd watch." For the moment, Trump seems to have clamped down on the infighting and rivalries among his top White House staffers that have spilled into the press and created a sense of paranoia in the West Wing. He praised his national security team in particular and said his political team in the White House does not get the credit it deserves for their work in a high-pressure setting. "This is a very tough environment," he said. "Not caused necessarily by me."

As the nation's top spies prepared to brief President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump on Russian interference in the 2016 election, they faced an excruciatingly delicate question: Should they mention the salacious allegations that had been circulating in Washington for months that Moscow had compromising information on the incoming president? Ultimately, they concluded they had no choice. A 35-page dossier packed with details of supposed compromising personal information, alleged financial entanglements and political intrigue was already in such wide circulation in Washington that every major news organization seemed to have a copy. "You'd be derelict if you didn't" mention the dossier, a U.S. official said. To ignore the file, produced by a private-sector security firm, would only make the supposed guardians of the nation's secrets seem uninformed, officials said, adding that many were convinced that it was only a matter of time before someone decided to publish the material. Their decision appears to have hastened that outcome, triggering coverage of politically charged allegations that news organizations had tried to run down for months but could find no basis for publishing until they were summarized and included alongside a highly classified report assembled by the nation's intelligence services. In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack... U.S. officials said Wednesday that the decision had been unanimous to attach the two-page summary of the dossier to a sweeping report on Russian election interference commissioned by the White House and briefed to Obama, Trump and congressional leaders. But U.S. intelligence officials appear to have been caught off-guard by the fallout, including a blistering attack by Trump, who accused spy agencies of engaging in Nazi-like tactics to smear him. In an effort to contain the damage, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday and "expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press." Clapper said in a statement issued late Wednesday that he told Trump that the allegations had come from a "private security company," that U.S. spy agencies had "not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable." "However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security," Clapper said. A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the nature of the summary "was fully explained" to Trump on Friday and "put into context." Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Chief James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers all concurred that both Obama and Trump should know that U.S. spy agencies were aware of the claims about compromising information on Trump and had investigated or explored them to some degree. During a rare press conference, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed reports on Russia's influence campaign, refused to release his tax returns and reiterated his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Jan. 11, 2017. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images | C-SPAN) U.S. officials emphasized that the summary was merely an annex to the main report, that the allegations it contained have never been substantiated and did not appear in the main body of the report or influence its conclusions that Russia sought to sabotage the 2016 race and help elect Trump. But linking a collection of unsubstantiated allegations to a classified report that is supposed to convey the intelligence community's firmest conclusions about Russian election interference has blurred the distinction between corroborated intelligence and innuendo. Former U.S. intelligence officials described the inclusion of the summary - drawn from "opposition research" done by a political research firm - as highly unusual. "It would be extraordinary if not unprecedented to bring to the attention of a president and president-elect a private document for which you had no reason to believe the allegations made in it," said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA and a Clinton supporter. Spokesmen for the CIA, FBI and the director of national intelligence declined to comment. The handling of the matter also seemed to deepen the level of distrust between Trump and the intelligence community, whose work he has repeatedly disparaged since his election victory two months ago. President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him while comparing the tactic to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine trust between the next commander in chief... President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him while comparing the tactic to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine trust between the next commander in chief... In a news conference in New York, Trump blasted U.S. intelligence agencies and accused them of employing Nazi-like tactics to discredit him. "I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake, out," Trump said, referring to a burst of headlines over the past two days about the dossier. "That's something that Nazi Germany would do and did do." The material in the dossier was assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, whose security and investigations firm was hired to assist a political research firm in Washington that was initially working for Trump's opponents in the Republican primaries but later offered its services to Democrats, according to individuals familiar with the matter. Steele's role was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. Since 2009, he and another former British intelligence officer have jointly operated a Britain-based firm called Orbis Business Intelligence. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The dossier was provided to multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post, which pursued numerous leads, including overseas, but could not substantiate its allegations. The document was also at some point delivered to the FBI. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., acknowledged in a public statement Wednesday that late last year he had "received sensitive information that has since been made public" and, unable to assess its accuracy, delivered the file to Comey. Other officials said that the FBI had obtained the dossier even before McCain's involvement and that U.S. officials had met with Steele, the former British spy, at least twice - once in August and again in mid-October, after Clapper had released a public statement accusing Russia of interfering in the election. Blurry video of highly placed men engaging in sexual acts, audio recordings of influential figures profanely insulting their nominal allies — in Russia these appear enough that a special word has evolved: "kompromat," or "compromising material." In the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Russia... Blurry video of highly placed men engaging in sexual acts, audio recordings of influential figures profanely insulting their nominal allies — in Russia these appear enough that a special word has evolved: "kompromat," or "compromising material." In the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Russia... Those meetings were part of a broader effort by the FBI and other agencies to evaluate the claims about Russia and compromising material on Trump. The dossier also included claims of ongoing, unexplained contacts between members of Trump's inner circle and allies of the Kremlin. The status of that inquiry is unclear. In Senate testimony Tuesday, Comey said that "we never confirm or deny a pending investigation." The line drew a reaction of disbelief from some lawmakers who have been sharply critical of Comey's decision during the election to discuss the bureau's probe of Hillary Clinton's email use. "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid," said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Although Comey was one of only four senior officials involved in the decision to include the two-page summary, some in Washington were quick to see that move as another political misstep by the FBI chief - calling arguably unnecessary attention to allegations against a major political figure. U.S. officials have offered conflicting accounts of what the meetings with Steele accomplished. A senior official said Tuesday that while the allegations in the two-page summary could not be corroborated, it was included in part because the sourcing was seen as reliable. Others disputed that and said that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate Steele's claims without getting detailed information about his sources in Russia, information he is seen as unlikely to be willing to share. A former senior U.S. intelligence official also questioned his ability to maneuver in Russia and gain access to high-level officials with ties to the Kremlin or Russian President Vladimir Putin. "How did this former British intelligence officer talk to all these Russian officials and not get arrested for espionage?" the former official asked. Steele's identity and association with his investigations firm are public, and are almost certainly known to Russian counterintelligence. "They would have been all over him," the former official said. "There are aspects of this [dossier] that are believable when you read it. There are other aspects that aren't." Some details would seem relatively easy for the FBI to assess, including meetings between close associates of Trump and Putin allies. But a senior law enforcement official acknowledged that other claims - including sweeping characterizations of relationships and rivalries inside the Kremlin - are more elusive. "This is not something we can validate or check out," the official said. "It's the view of people in Russia. It's not like we can go out and determine its veracity." The Washington Post's Sari Horwitz and Julie Tate contributed to this report.

In his carefully calibrated testimony before House appropriators, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price made one thing clear Wednesday: The administration is still intent on dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act even if Republicans lack the votes to rewrite it. Time and time again, Price invoked the pledge he has made repeatedly to lawmakers since President Donald Trump selected him for his post. "What we're committed to is making sure the American people have access to affordable coverage," he told Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies. But under intense questioning from Democrats, Price outlined how his department could make insurance plans cheaper by scaling back several federal mandates, including what the ACA currently defines as "essential benefits" in coverage. And he refused to say whether the administration will keep providing cost-sharing subsidies for insurers participating in the federal marketplace. The multibillion-dollar infusion is critical to maintaining the system's stability, insurers say. At one point, DeLauro asked Price whether the administration wanted to "repeal or strengthen and improve" the 2010 health-care law. "We believe that the current law has harmed many individuals," the secretary said. "So you will continue to move at repeal, is what I gained from that conversation," she replied. House Republicans are considering making another run next week at passing the health-care bill they abruptly pulled from the floor in an embarrassing setback to their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Two Republican lawmakers say that leaders are discussing holding a vote, even staying into the weekend... House Republicans are considering making another run next week at passing the health-care bill they abruptly pulled from the floor in an embarrassing setback to their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Two Republican lawmakers say that leaders are discussing holding a vote, even staying into the weekend... Even before House Republicans withdrew legislation last week that would have jettisoned key aspects of the ACA, White House officials had pledged to pursue a "phase two" through executive action. This stage could cover everything from how aggressively the government promotes enrollment under the law to what sort of financial support it gives to prop up the ACA marketplace. While House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is encouraging factions from the GOP's moderate and conservative wings to negotiate a possible health-care compromise, several individuals briefed on the leadership's plans said there is no immediate interest in bringing a revised bill up for a House vote. Ryan said in a CBS News interview Wednesday that if Republicans don't unite, Trump would "just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare." "That's hardly a conservative thing," he said. Insurers are particularly anxious to know whether the cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income people to afford their out-of-pocket costs, which House Republicans have challenged in court as illegal, will continue. According to the Congressional Budget Office, those federal payments will total $7 billion this year and $10 billion in 2018. Price noted that as secretary he is now the named defendant in the lawsuit, and "I'm not able to comment." AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said the House GOP is "actively working with the administration" on options for resolving the suit and possibly appropriating the subsidies. "No decisions have been made," she said. Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health... Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health... Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the panel before which Price testified Wednesday, said he was open to providing the funds but that it would have to be a House leadership decision. "It's probably the right thing to do, I think. Otherwise you're going to have insurance companies exiting the market," Cole said. Michael Adelberg, a health-care principal at FaegreBD Consulting, considers the subsidies "the single most important action" the administration can take to stabilize the marketplace. Refusing to pay them will bring "significant premium increases," Adelberg said in an email. "Some insurers will drop out, and the remaining insurers will have to seek large rate increases." Molina Healthcare chief executive Mario Molina said recently that the cost-sharing funds are a major uncertainty hanging over his company's ability to participate in the marketplaces going forward. Another is enforcement of the individual mandate that compels Americans to provide proof of insurance on their taxes. "If the president chooses not to enforce the mandate, he's going to drive up the cost for many, many people," Molina said, noting that premiums would probably rise 15 percent if it is not enforced. If cost-sharing reductions are eliminated, he added, premiums would rise an additional 10 to 12 percent. Price indicated Wednesday that the individual mandate remained in place, telling the panel, "So long as the law's on the books, we at the department are obliged to uphold the law." House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation's health-care system by working "on two tracks" as he also pursues other elements of President Donald Trump's agenda. "We are going to keep getting at this thing," Ryan said... House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation's health-care system by working "on two tracks" as he also pursues other elements of President Donald Trump's agenda. "We are going to keep getting at this thing," Ryan said... But the president offered leeway in enforcing the mandate hours after his inauguration in January, when he signed an executive order instructing agencies "to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens" associated with the ACA, in part by acting to "waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay" its rules. Republicans urged the secretary to use the available levers available to pare back requirements that have led to more comprehensive - and costly - health plans under the ACA. "You do have the ability to make regulatory changes that would dramatically lower the cost of insurance for Americans?" asked Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md. "Fourteen hundred and forty-two times the ACA said 'the secretary shall' or 'the secretary may,' " Price replied. On several occasions, Price suggested he may define how much insurers would have to cover under the category of essential benefits, which includes maternity and newborn care as well as substance abuse and mental-health treatment. President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence.

President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... Asked by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., whether maternity care "should be a covered benefit under federal law," Price said consumers should make that decision in the coverage they choose, "not the kind that the government forces them to buy." When Lowey pressed him on whether women should be able to access contraception without having to pay an insurance co-pay - another ACA mandate - Price made the same point. "Again, this is one of those areas where we think individuals ought to have access to the kind of coverage that they want, not the kind of coverage that the government forces them to buy," he said. The administration is likely to face resistance from the opposition party in making those changes. After House Democrats met behind closed doors Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill to formulate a health-care strategy, key members said they were focused on blocking any steps the administration might take to weaken the law while continuing to blame its shortcomings on Democrats. "What we will do is lay out for the American people exactly what steps [Trump] can and probably will take to try to undermine the law, so they understand when he takes those actions . . . that he is the one taking away health-care coverage from millions of Americans," said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. The Washington Post's Carolyn Johnson contributed to this report.

House Republicans are considering making another run next week at passing the health-care bill they abruptly pulled from the floor in an embarrassing setback to their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Two Republican lawmakers say that leaders are discussing holding a vote, even staying into the weekend if necessary, but it's unclear what changes would be made to the GOP's health bill. They described the discussions on condition of anonymity. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who helped derail the bill, have been talking with some Republican moderate holdouts in an effort to identify changes that could bring them on board with the measure. The renewed discussion comes after President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress said they would move on to issues like a tax overhaul in the wake of last week's drama, when the long-awaited bill was pulled 30 minutes ahead of a scheduled floor vote. Hospital companies declined on the news. The BI North America Hospitals Competitive Peer Group index fell 2.7 percent at 3:28 p.m. in New York. Asked if the GOP health bill will come up again, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, "Yes. As soon as we figure it out and get the votes." But McCarthy said nothing is currently scheduled and didn't indicate how leadership would resolve divisions between the Freedom Caucus and moderates in the so-called Tuesday Group. "Lot of people are talking," he said. "Lot of people are working." House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation's health-care system by working "on two tracks" as he also pursues other elements of President Donald Trump's agenda. "We are going to keep getting at this thing," Ryan said... House Speaker Paul D.

"We are going to keep getting at this thing," Ryan said... House Speaker Paul Ryan is encouraging members to continue talking to each other about health care to "get to a place of yes" on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to his spokeswoman AshLee Strong. She didn't have any updates on the timing on a future vote. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, has been negotiating with colleagues on a compromise. "There's a real commitment among members he's been speaking with to not give up and move expeditiously toward a path forward," his spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, said. "But he doesn't want to constrain himself to artificial deadlines like 'before recess.'" The discussion of a new vote comes with House Republican leaders and other key lawmakers leery of playing up talk of a redo. To set such expectations -- only to again not have a vote occur -- could be even more awkward for members when they leave Washington next week for a two-week recess. President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence.

President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... Other Republicans said they're unaware of any plans to act on health care, and the remaining disagreements on the measure could be very difficult to resolve. "I haven't heard anything as to what leadership is doing," said Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina. "The issue is very complex." Multiple House Republicans said they've heard from constituents who want to still repeal the Affordable Care Act and hope the issue isn't dead. "I'm very optimistic we can get something done in the real near future. And when I say in the near future, it may be two weeks, it may be a month," said Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama. "I do think it will come up again, the question is when. The form will have to change some," said Representative Morgan Griffith of Virginia, adding that there remains a strong desire among conservative activists to undo the law. "If both the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group can agree on some things, then we're in good shape," he said. He said failing to achieve meaningful change would hurt Republicans in 2018. "If we just sit up here and play tiddlywinks, it'll hurt us," he said. The House is scheduled to begin a two-week recess starting April 7, and Republicans would like to return home having passed their health-care measure. Even so, it would mark quite a turnaround for a measure that had been declared dead. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded ready to move on Tuesday. "It is pretty obvious we were not able in the House to pass a replacement," he told reporters. "Our Democratic friends ought to be pretty happy about that because we have the existing law in place and I think we're just gonna have to see how that works out." But Greg Walden, a Republican from Oregon and former Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, sounded optimistic on Tuesday. "We're approaching the Easter season," he said. "Some things rise from the dead." Bloomberg's Anna Edgerton contributed.

Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health and human services secretary will be faced with a series of choices over whether to shore up insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act - or let them atrophy. These marketplaces are currently a conduit to health coverage for 10 million Americans, but they have been financially fragile, prompting spiking rates and defections of major insurers. In an interview on Friday with The Washington Post, Trump made his inclinations clear: "The best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode." The president said that the law remains "totally the property of the Democrats" and that "when people get a 200 percent increase next year or a 100 percent or 70 percent, that's their fault." Former Obama administration officials countered that Trump and congressional Republicans are responsible for what happens next. In the seven years since a Democratic Congress passed the law, public sentiment over it has been closely divided. Support has grown slightly in recent months as Republicans tried to begin dismantling it. There are many levers within the ACA that the administration could use to undermine the law or, instead, try to stabilize its marketplaces. In addition, federal rules could be redefined, giving the government's health policies a more conservative twist even with the law still in effect. According to health-care experts from across the ideological spectrum, an imminent question is whether the political tumult surrounding the ACA's fate and the president's talk of explosion could further shake the confidence of consumers and insurers alike. Doing so could prompt exits from the marketplaces. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. Trump's threat could become "a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the last two years of the Obama administration. " That's like inheriting an overseas war, and deciding you let your own soldiers get killed because you didn't elect to enter that war." Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small company covering about a million Americans through the ACA's insurance exchanges, said he is unsure whether it will lessen its participation. Its decision this spring will hinge on actions by the White House and GOP lawmakers, he said. "The ball's sort of in their court. The choices they make are going to determine what happens to the marketplace." The decisions facing the administration are, in essence, a sequel to an executive order the president issued his first night in office, when he directed federal agencies to ease the regulatory burden that the ACA has placed on consumers, the health-care industry and health-care providers. So far, the main action stemming from that directive is a move by the Internal Revenue Service to process Americans' tax refunds even if they fail to submit proof that they are insured, as the ACA requires. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... But there are other steps the administration could take. A major one would be to end cost-sharing subsidies the law provides to lower- and middle-income people with marketplace plans to help pay their deductibles and copays. Those subsidies, which would have been erased by the House Republicans' bill, are the subject of a federal lawsuit. Another question is how the administration will handle the next enrollment season for ACA health plans, which will begin in November. The end of the most recent season coincided with Trump's first days in office, and the new administration yanked some advertising meant to encourage sign-ups - resulting in a small dip in enrollment by the final deadline. And while a set of federal essential health benefits, required of health plans sold to individuals and small businesses, will now remain in law, federal health officials could narrow what they require, limiting prescription drugs, for instance, or the number of visits allowed for mental health treatment or physical therapy. The administration also could take advantage of a part of the ACA that, starting this year, lets health officials give states broad latitude to carry out the law's goals - including more free-market approaches that conservatives favor. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and other top agency officials already have signaled they would allow states to impose work requirements on able-bodied adults to qualify for Medicaid - something Obama officials steadfastly rejected. "The administration could do everything from actively undermining the law to trying to reshape it to moving it in a more conservative direction," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The question of whether the ACA's marketplaces can or should be strengthened is a matter of considerable debate. In comparing the House GOP bill with the ACA, congressional budget analysts concluded this month that the insurance market for people who buy coverage on their own "would probably be stable in most areas" either way. During an afternoon news conference shortly after withdrawing the Republican legislation, Ryan reiterated his oft-stated contention that the marketplaces are beyond repair. He briefly suggested, however, that perhaps the Trump administration could improve their stability. Chip Kahn, president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, said that policymakers must find a way to shore up the marketplaces because a broad swath of Americans rely on them. "There always has been an individual market made up of entrepreneurs who own small businesses, and farmers and ranchers, and it's sort of mandatory that there be policies available to them," Kahn said. House Republicans were notably silent on Friday about the prospects of further work on health policy. A few senators sounded more hopeful that efforts to improve the law would continue. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in an interview that he disagreed with Trump's assertion that letting the markets explode was the best course of action. "I hope that doesn't have to happen," said Cassidy, co-sponsor of a separate bill that would preserve the ACA but tip more latitude to the states. Harvard University economics professor David Cutler, who helped advise the Obama White House on health care, countered Trump's argument that the ACA will always be associated with Democrats. "He owns it now," Cutler said in an email, "because he could take many steps to stabilize things." Carolyn Y. Johnson contributed to this report.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation's health-care system by working "on two tracks" as he also pursues other elements of President Donald Trump's agenda. "We are going to keep getting at this thing," Ryan said three days after intraparty opposition forced him to pull the American Health Care Act after it became clear it did not have enough Republican votes to pass. On an afternoon call with donors to his Team Ryan political organization, he continued: "We're not going to just all of a sudden abandon health care and move on to the rest. We are going to move on with rest of our agenda, keep that on track, while we work the health-care problem. . . . It's just that valuable, that important." Ryan, R-Wis., did not disclose details of what the next iteration of his health-care changes might look like, but he suggested that a plan was being developed in time to brief the donors at a retreat scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Florida. His remarks indicated that Republicans may be trying to regroup more quickly than Ryan had suggested they would on Friday, when he declared Obamacare "the law of the land" for the foreseeable future. "When we're in Florida, I will lay out the path forward on health care and all the rest of the agenda," Ryan said in the call Monday, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post. "I will explain how it all still works, and how we're still moving forward on health care with other ideas and plans. So please make sure that if you can come, you come - it will be good to look at what can feasibly get done and where things currently stand. But know this: We are not giving up." Trump said Friday that he wanted to move on to the rest of his agenda - tax reform, in particular - and that he was content to leave the Affordable Care Act in place and let it "explode." "If the Democrats - when it explodes, which it will soon - if they got together with us and got a real health-care bill, I'd be totally open to it, and I think that's going to happen," he said. In addition, White House press secretary Sean Spicer left the door open at Monday's briefing to further efforts. "We're at the beginning of a process," he said. "I don't think we've seen the end of health care." Ryan did not take questions on the roughly 10-minute call. Zack Roday, a spokesman for the speaker's political operation, declined to comment. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for the speaker's office, said Ryan huddled with Trump at the White House on Monday and also met separately about the coming legislative agenda with Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. "It's safe to say we're having these conversations," she said. "We look forward to talking with our members on Tuesday when we get back." The call Monday came at the most challenging moment of Ryan's 17-month tenure as speaker: the failure of the American Health Care Act, for which he played the central role in assembling and promoting, throws into doubt the Republican Party's basic ability to govern even with unified control of the White House and Congress. Regrouping after a rocky few weeks, the White House declared Monday that President Donald Trump doesn't consider the health care battle to be over, suggesting he may turn to Democrats to help him overhaul the system after his own party rejected his proposal. The sudden interest in bipartisanship... Regrouping after a rocky few weeks, the White House declared Monday that President Donald Trump doesn't consider the health care battle to be over, suggesting he may turn to Democrats to help him overhaul the system after his own party rejected his proposal. The sudden interest in bipartisanship... Speaking to the donors Monday, Ryan gave an explanation similar to the one he offered reporters on Friday - where he said that "moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains." But he was more forthright in seeming to lay the blame on the members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right bloc that was a crucial factor in the health-care bill's demise. "Basically . . . 90 percent of our members of the conference were there and ready to go and be a governing party and were happy with where we were, and around 10 percent were still in what I would call 'opposition party mode,' " Ryan said on the call. "About 10 percent of our people, a particular bloc, just weren't there yet, even with the president's involvement." While Freedom Caucus members played a central role in opposing the bill, Ryan did not mention a significant group of moderate Republican who also had qualms about the proposal. The Post has counted at least 25 GOP members not considered aligned with the hard right who had announced they were opposing or leaning against the plan. In a Sunday interview with ABC's "This Week," Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said he still considered the bill to be "in the negotiation process" and that conservatives and moderates would "come together, hopefully in the coming days, to find consensus." But it remained unclear how the GOP health-care push could be salvaged. Trump has turned his sights on the hard right, tweeting Sunday that "Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!" One Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, announced Sunday that he was resigning from the group out of disgust for how it handled the issue, raising the prospect that the group could crack up after foiling Trump and Ryan on a front-burner item. President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... "I think that there was nothing that could be added to the bill that the Freedom Caucus would ever vote yes on," Poe told CNN on Monday. "I got the opinion that there's some members of the Freedom Caucus, they would vote no against the Ten Commandments if they came up for a vote." There was no indication that there would be any further Freedom Caucus defections - nor evidence that the moderates who abandoned the bill could be wooed back. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a founder and former chairman of the group, said he had no regrets about killing the bill. "The lesson here is don't try to pass a bill that only 17 percent of the country approves of - that's a problem," he on MSNBC Monday. "When no one likes the legislation, you have to do it different." GOP House members who returned to Washington on Monday split on whether the bill had any near-term prospects. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., said he had been "slammed" over the weekend by constituents angry that the bill had failed: "We maybe make a few tweaks and change it, but I still think it's valid. Bring it up. We worked too hard on this." But Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said he did not believe the fundamental politics of the issue had changed or that his colleagues could stomach another internecine battle. "It's an open wound right now - ask the Freedom Caucus," Collins said. "I'm guessing we've all moved on, because it's not going to do any good to open the wound again." Ryan acknowledged on the call that he leads a deeply divided conference that is threatening to descend into open infighting. By pulling the bill Friday, Ryan said, he moved to "let a little pressure off the system, let some nerves cool a little bit and then get back talking with each other while we work on this issue and all the other issues." "Ninety percent of our conference was very, very upset with about 10 percent, and I didn't want things being done and said that people would regret," he said. "So I sent folks home for the weekend to just kind of soak in what had happened, appreciate the situation and start over and get back to work again." Nonetheless, tensions remained evident. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., rose in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Thursday night to lambaste Meadows and the Freedom Caucus, only to be talked down by colleagues wary of sparking an intraparty shouting match. But Scott let loose in a tweet Saturday: "Mark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare." And then there are the tensions between Ryan and Trump, a fraught relationship dating back to the presidential campaign that was once again cast into doubt Saturday when Trump asked his 27 million Twitter followers to tune in to the Fox News show of Jeanine Pirro - who proceeded to call for Ryan's removal as speaker. A Fox News personality - whom President Donald Trump had urged his supporters to watch Saturday night - called on House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to step down, saying he had done a disservice to Trump by failing to pass a high-profile health-care bill this week.

At the top of her show, Jeanine... In a Fox News interview Sunday, Priebus said the tweet and Pirro's call were "coincidental" and that Trump was "helping out a friend" by promoting Pirro's show. Ryan did not mention the episode in the call Monday, but he said he had spoken to Trump "four or five times this weekend . . . and we see it the same way: We're completely united on how we move forward and where we go from here and how we need this effort moving." "In a strange way, this really merged our teams - our team in the House with the president's team - even more closely," he said at another point in the call. "I think the White House, the president in particular, has a much, much clearer understanding of just the dynamic that we have in the House Republican Conference. And so that, if anything, is very helpful that he really now appreciates the challenges we have of governing and of becoming a governing party."

President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet that singled out the House Freedom Caucus as well as the influential Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America - marked a new turn in the increasingly troubled relationship between the White House and a divided GOP still adjusting to its unorthodox standard-bearer. And it served as a warning shot, with battles still to come on issues such as taxes and infrastructure that threaten to further expose Republican fractures, that Trump will not hesitate to apply public pressure on those in his party he views as standing in the way. In a sign Sunday of the ripple effects on the GOP's conservative flank, one high-profile member of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, resigned from the group and took a swipe at its opposition to the Trump-backed health care bill. "Saying no is easy, leading is hard," he said. The rising tensions followed a flurry of finger-pointing after Friday's decision by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to pull the health care measure, effectively ending for now the GOP's years-long quest to repeal President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, resigned Sunday from the coalition of 35 to 40 conservative... Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, resigned Sunday from the coalition of 35 to 40 conservative... Not long ago, many Republican leaders, even as they were wary of Trump's unusual background and style, had considered his presidency a chance to finally unify the party around passing a long-sought policy agenda. But now, in the health care bill's raw aftermath, Republican leaders are learning that the Trump presidency is doing little, if anything, to heal their party. "We've been here before," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., the co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. "The only difference is now we have a Republican president and some people thought the fever might break a little bit. But apparently not." Trump's attack Sunday had the look of a coordinated effort. His tweet appeared at 8:21 a.m. as official Washington prepared to tune into Sunday news shows: "Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!" Less than an hour later, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared on television to echo his boss' sentiments, saying his missive hit "the bull's eye." As if to rub salt in the GOP's wound, Priebus hinted that Trump may simply start looking past the Republican majority and try forging more consensus with moderate Democrats in future legislative battles. He pointed to the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group for heavily resisting the health care bill. "We can't be chasing the perfect all the time," Priebus said during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday." "I mean, sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win." Although Trump targeted conservative opponents of the bill Sunday, he has also shown signs of frustration with its moderate critics. On NBC's "Meet the Press," Dent acknowledged that Trump told him in a private meeting that he was "destroying the Republican Party" and that he "was going to take down tax reform," as first reported by the New York Times magazine. Trump's tweet came a day after a strange episode that prompted speculation that he was seeking to undermine Ryan's standing. Trump encouraged his Twitter followers Saturday to watch Jeanine Pirro, one of his favorite Fox News Channel hosts, that night. A Fox News personality - whom President Donald Trump had urged his supporters to watch Saturday night - called on House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to step down, saying he had done a disservice to Trump by failing to pass a high-profile health-care bill this week.

At the top of her show, Jeanine... On her program, Pirro said that Ryan should resign as speaker, adding that despite his "swagger and experience," he presided over a failed effort that allowed "our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that." Priebus, in his Sunday appearance, dismissed the episode as a coincidence, and Trump has said in recent days that he has a good relationship with Ryan. "He doesn't blame Paul Ryan," Priebus said on Fox News. "In fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House." Nonetheless, the episode served to highlight the challenges ahead for Ryan in attempting to regain control over the House GOP and maintain a working rapport with the White House. Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and former congressional aide, said Republicans' inability to forge consensus on health care shook the party to the core. "It's hard to see where we can be successful, and it leads to a lot of questions as to whether Republicans can govern, even with a Republican in the White House," he said. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a Republican former congressman who helped found the Freedom Caucus, was at a loss Sunday to explain why so many of those members were not prepared to vote for the health care bill. Speaking on "Meet the Press," Mulvaney said that conservatives were not the only ones to blame, saying, "It was a bizarre combination of who was against this bill, some folks in the Freedom Caucus and then moderates on the other end of our spectrum." Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who heads the Freedom Caucus, responded to the tweet without any animosity toward the president. Driven by an obsession for a quick win and failing to grasp the complexities of an issue that has bedeviled politicians for generations, President Trump learned last week that the negotiating tricks and power plays he honed in business don’t translate into the messy world of Congress. “Political... Driven by an obsession for a quick win and failing to grasp the complexities of an issue that has bedeviled politicians for generations, President Trump learned last week that the negotiating tricks and power plays he honed in business don’t translate into the messy world of Congress. “Political... "I mean, if [Democrats are] applauding, they shouldn't, because I can tell you that conversations over the last 48 hours are really about how we come together in the Republican Conference and try to get this over the finish line," he said on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus did not comment on Trump's tweet or Poe's departure. It was unclear whether Trump's statement had a direct effect on Poe's decision to leave the caucus. The tweet directed at the Freedom Caucus was "a reminder that nothing goes without notice," said one Trump associate with direct knowledge of White House strategy. The Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the White House, said that Trump was disappointed in Meadows and others in the caucus and wanted to remind them that he can use his powers to make their lives more difficult if they are not with him in the future. The Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, which is an affiliate of the Heritage Foundation, a longtime conservative think tank, are known for staking out positions that are often at odds with those of GOP leaders. Heritage Action on Sunday defended the House Freedom Caucus's decision not to support the health care legislation while striking a conciliatory tone with the president. The bill "had no natural constituency and was widely criticized by conservative health care experts because it left a premium-increasing provision of Obamacare in place," said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. "We now have the opportunity to reset the debate, and conservatives are eager to work with the administration and congressional leadership as things move forward." The Club for Growth did not respond to requests for comment. The House GOP bill would have repealed and replaced key parts of the Affordable Care Act. It came under consistent criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. Ryan and Trump pulled the bill Friday afternoon after deciding it could not pass - after weeks of negotiations with conservative and centrist Republican members of the sizable GOP House majority. Although Ryan's job doesn't appear to be in jeopardy, his ability to shepherd the rest of the Republican agenda through his chamber is in doubt. Some Freedom Caucus members are wary of efforts that would add to the federal deficit. But in a sign that Meadows may be willing to compromise on tax reform, he said that tax cuts don't necessarily have to be paired with spending cuts or revenue increases. "Does it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no," he said on ABC. Since Friday, Trump aides have been talking increasingly about reaching out to moderate Democrats for help not only on another health care bill but also on other priorities. But prospects for such cooperation remain difficult. There has been virtually no outreach to Democrats about a tax package. Although Democrats like the idea of infrastructure spending, the parties have different visions of how it should be paid for. "If he aims a proposal aimed at the middle class and the poor people . . . we could work with them. But I don't think they're headed in that direction, and they're going repeat the same mistake" they made with the health care bill, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted of tax reform on "This Week." Aides and advisers to Trump say it's clear that he will need support from some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, to move parts of his agenda forward beyond tax reform. Michael Steel, who was a senior aide to then-Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Trump is at a crossroads as he takes up tax reform. "The president is going to have a choice: to reach out to moderate Democrats and work in a bipartisan fashion or to reach out to recalcitrant Republicans in his own party that he wasn't able to get this time," he said.

A Fox News personality - whom President Donald Trump had urged his supporters to watch Saturday night - called on House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to step down, saying he had done a disservice to Trump by failing to pass a high-profile health-care bill this week. At the top of her show, Jeanine Pirro, host of "Justice With Judge Jeanine," delivered a scathing commentary on Ryan's performance in the days leading up to the decision to pull the House Republican bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. "It failed within the first 70 days of President Donald Trump's administration, a president who made the replacement of Obamacare the hallmark of his campaign and then used valuable political capital to accomplish it," said Pirro, placing the blame squarely on Ryan. Earlier Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to urge his followers to tune into Pirro's show, saying: " Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M." In public statements since the bill's collapse, both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have continued to support Ryan as speaker. Earlier Saturday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's tweet was motivated only by his being a fan of Pirro's show. Spicer did not immediately respond after the show had aired. After delivering her commentary, Pirro said that there had been no coordination with Trump in her messaging. "When he tweeted, 'Watch Judge Jeanine tonight,' he and I had absolutely no conversation, no discussion, no email, nothing," she said. In her commentary, Pirro took aim squarely at Ryan for the bill's failure. "Speaker Ryan, you come in with all your swagger and experience and you sell 'em a bill of goods, which ends up a complete and total failure, and you allow our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that, based on what?" she said. "Your legislative expertise, your knowledge of the arcane ins and outs of the bill writing-process? Your relationships? What? Your drinks at the Hay Adams with your pals?"

If President Donald Trump is going to put the blame for Republicans' inability to pass health care legislation on the House Freedom Caucus, at least one member of the conservative coalition thinks it deserves it. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, resigned Sunday from the coalition of 35 to 40 conservative House lawmakers in protest over the group's opposition to the Republican health care bill that tanked in Congress on Friday. "I have resigned from the House Freedom Caucus," Poe said in a statement. "In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward. Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do. Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective Member of Congress and advocate for the people of Texas. It is time to lead." Poe's resignation comes hours after Trump tweeted that the Freedom Caucus, along with cash-flush conservative groups that share its hard-line ideological views, "have saved Planned Parenthood" and Obamacare by opposing the bill. It's not clear whether Trump's statement had a direct effect on Poe's decision to leave the caucus. He was leaning toward voting for the bill, and he was openly critical of his conservative colleagues as the bill was being pulled from a vote. As the fallout from Republicans' inability to make good on a major campaign promise continues, the White House and GOP leaders are increasingly vocal about their frustrations with the House Freedom Caucus. "We can't be chasing the perfect all the time," Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Sunday on Fox News, raising the possibility that the White House will put less emphasis on negotiating with the caucus going forward and try to work with Democrats instead. Toward the end of the hourlong town hall in Columbia, S.C.,... Toward the end of the hourlong town hall in Columbia, S.C.,... Despite half a dozen concessions the White House and GOP House leaders offered to the caucus on health care, its leaders held out support — enough that, when combined with opposition from moderate Republicans, it killed the bill before it could even come to a vote. The establishment GOP's frustration was channeled in a single tweet over the weekend, not from Trump but from Rep. Austin Scott, Ga., whose biting accusation raised eyebrows in GOP circles because Scott is not known to be a flamethrower: Scott tweeted, "Mark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare." This week in Washington, a staggered president and his party dig out from the rubble of their failed Obamacare replacement effort. As House Speaker Paul Ryan says, there's no sugarcoating this. The politics of the Republicans' failure to pass, or even vote on, the American Health Care Act was ugly.... This week in Washington, a staggered president and his party dig out from the rubble of their failed Obamacare replacement effort. As House Speaker Paul Ryan says, there's no sugarcoating this. The politics of the Republicans' failure to pass, or even vote on, the American Health Care Act was ugly.... Poe is not the first lawmaker to resign from the Freedom Caucus. In September 2015, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., became the first to step away from the group as it threatened to shut down the government over federal funding for Planned Parenthood. In a comment that channels what Trump said Sunday, McClintock protested the group's tactics as playing right into the hands of the Democrats. "It has thwarted vital conservative policy objectives," he wrote, "and wittingly become Nancy Pelosi's tactical ally." In October 2015, Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., resigned after the Freedom Caucus played a role in forcing then-Rep. John Boehner, R-Wis., to resign as House speaker. "I was a member of the Freedom Caucus in the very beginning because we were focused on making process reforms to get every Member's voice heard and advance conservative policy," Ribble said in a statement. "When the Speaker resigned and they pivoted to focusing on the leadership race, I withdrew."

House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for President Donald Trump's agenda, from taxes to infrastructure to the budget. Looming in a few weeks is the need to agree on a bill to keep the government open. After the health care debacle, Trump told Republican leaders he's moving on. The episode is a danger point for the relationship between Trump and Ryan, who had an awkward pairing during the campaign but worked in tandem on the GOP health measure. "I like Speaker Ryan," Trump said. "I think Paul really worked hard." Virtually every congressional Republican won election promising to repeal Obamacare. With a Republican in the White House, passage seemed almost guaranteed. Ryan was steeped in the details, even at one point replicating for a nationwide cable news audience a detailed PowerPoint presentation he delivered to his members. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this month, he said flatly, "We'll have 218 (votes) when this thing comes to the floor, I can guarantee you that." Ryan was thrust into the speaker's chair after the stunning 2015 resignation of John Boehner, R-Ohio, and a failed bid by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. At the time, Ryan held his dream job — chairman of the powerful, tax-writing Ways and Means Committee — but took the job as the last viable option to lead a fractured House GOP. While Ryan eased comfortably into the job, he's not the schmoozer Boehner was, a key skill in delivering like-minded but reluctant lawmakers. He lacked the steel and seasoning of Democratic rival Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who delivered Obamacare in the first place — and that took months, not weeks. Even before the bill went down, Pelosi was piling on, taunting Trump and, by implication, Ryan, for rushing the bill to the floor too early. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... "You build your consensus in your caucus, and when you're ready, you set the date to bring it to the floor," Pelosi said. "Rookie's error, Donald Trump. You may be a great negotiator. Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready." Ryan entered the health care debate without the experience of having ever managed a situation of such magnitude. "We were a 10-year opposition party where being against things was easy to do," a clearly disappointed Ryan said Friday. "And now, in three months' time, we've tried to go to a governing party, where we have to actually get ... people to agree with each other in how we do things." During former President Barack Obama's tenure, Ryan had always been able to lean on Democrats to pass legislation Obama would sign. On health care, however, Ryan could only count on Republicans, inheriting a fractious group that was schooled in opposing Obama, but lacking in the required team spirit to be a functioning, governing party. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. It's a far different situation facing Ryan than he witnessed when joining the House in 1999. Then, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and legendary Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ran the House with a five-vote majority, instilling a team spirit that is wholly lacking today. Ryan also lacks the tools available to prior leaders, like hometown earmarks. "It's sometimes easier to do things with a smaller majority, because you all realize you've got to stick together or you won't get anything done," said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. "When you get a bigger majority you have factions. And then the challenge is dealing with the different factions." Instead, Ryan struggled — and failed — to thread the needle between conservative hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and moderate lawmakers worried that the GOP measure would harm their constituents — and their political prospects in midterm elections that promise to be bruising for Republicans. While Trump focused on winning over the Freedom Caucus, Ryan failed to keep more pragmatic lawmakers like Rep. David Young, R-Iowa, in line. When Young announced his opposition, a superPAC affiliated with Ryan, the Congressional Leadership Fund, announced it would pull its support from Young. President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan are staring at a moment that could define or derail their tenures, with the vote on the GOP measure to repeal and replace Obamacare approaching and the tally seemingly moving against them.

Ryan are staring at a moment that could define or derail their tenures, with the vote on the GOP measure to repeal and replace Obamacare approaching and the tally seemingly moving against them. The two are not natural allies, something that was clear during... To be sure, several factors conspired against Ryan. Trump sometimes sent mixed signals about how solidly he was behind the effort. The White House is short-handed and its staff is inexperienced in the art of legislating. And Ryan's vote-counting team failed at basic tasks like keeping lawmakers, including the chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., from issuing public statements promising to oppose the bill. "We don't browbeat our folks," said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. "That's why it's harder to keep Republicans in line." Ryan's stature appears secure. And even if Trump and his allies were upset with Ryan, there's no obvious replacement, given the party's short leadership roster. "I don't think this will impact Speaker Ryan because everyone in our conference, whether you're voting yes or no, does know he put his heart and soul into this," said Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump ally. "I am certainly not blaming Paul Ryan in the least." "He's highly respected. He worked very hard on this," said Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa. "He went in for the right reasons."

President Donald Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint, since it was a blocked number. Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. "Hello, Bob," Trump began. "So, we just pulled it." Trump was speaking, of course, of the Republican effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, a plan that had been languishing for days amid unrest throughout the party as the president and his allies courted members and pushed for a vote. Before I could ask a question, Trump plunged into his explanation of the politics of deciding to call off a vote on a bill he had been touting. The Democrats, he said, were to blame. "We couldn't get one Democratic vote, and we were a little bit shy, very little, but it was still a little bit shy, so we pulled it," Trump said. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. Trump said he would not put the bill on the floor in the coming weeks. He is willing to wait and watch the current law continue and, in his view, encounter problems. And he believes that Democrats eventually will want to work with him on some kind of legislative fix to Obamacare, although he did not say when that will be. "As you know, I've been saying for years that the best thing is to let Obamacare explode, and then go make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal. And they will come to us; we won't have to come to them," he said. "After Obamacare explodes." "The beauty," Trump continued, "is that they own Obamacare. So when it explodes, they come to us, and we make one beautiful deal for the people." My question for the president: Are you really willing to wait to reengage on health care until the Democrats come and ask for your help? "Sure," Trump said. "I never said I was going to repeal and replace in the first 61 days" - contradicting his own statements and that of his adviser Kellyanne Conway, who told CNN in November that the then-president-elect was contemplating convening a special session on Inauguration Day to begin the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law.

In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... Turning to an aide, Trump asked, "How many days is it now? Whatever." He laughed. Trump returned to the theme of blaming the Democrats. "Hey, we could have done this," he said. "But we couldn't get one Democrat vote, not one. So that means they own Obamacare, and when that explodes, they will come to us wanting to save whatever is left, and we'll make a real deal." There is little evidence that either Trump or House Republicans made a serious effort to reach out to Democrats. Still, I wondered, why not whip some more votes this weekend and come back next week to the House with a revised piece of legislation? "Well," Trump said, "we could do that, too. But we didn't do that. It's always possible, but we pulled it." Trump brought up the vote count. "We were close," he said. How close? House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for... House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for... "I would say within anywhere from five to 12 votes," Trump said - although widespread reports indicated that at least three dozen Republicans opposed the measure. That must have hurt after all of his attempts to rally Republicans, I said. He made calls, had people over to the White House, invited House members on Air Force One. He may not have loved the bill, but he embraced the negotiations. "You're right," Trump said. "I'm a team player, but I've also said the best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode." Trump said he made the decision to pull the bill after meeting Friday at the White House with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis. Was that a tense, tough conversation with Ryan, I asked? "No, not tough," Trump said. "It's just life. We had great support among most Republicans but no Democratic votes. Zero. Not one." I mentioned to Trump that some of his allies were frustrated with Ryan. Did he share those frustrations, and would he be able to work with Ryan moving forward on plans to cut taxes and build an infrastructure package? "I don't blame Paul," Trump said. He then repeated the phrase: "I don't blame Paul. He worked very hard on this." And again. "I don't blame Paul at all." As he waits for Democrats, I asked, what's next on health care, if anything, policy-wise? "Time will tell. Obamacare is in for some rough days. You understand that. It's in for some rough, rough days," Trump said. "I'll fix it as it explodes," he said. "They're going to come to ask for help. They're going to have to. Here's the good news: Health care is now totally the property of the Democrats." Speaking of premium increases, Trump said, "When people get a 200 percent increase next year or a 100 percent or 70 percent, that's their fault." He returned again to a partisan line on the turn of events. "To be honest, the biggest losers today are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer," Trump said of the House minority leader and the Senate minority leader. "Because now they own the disaster known as Obamacare." Okay, I asked, they may own it, in his view, but he will at some point be tasked with shaping whatever comes forward as a partial replacement. What will that be? What kind of policy could he support? "Oh, lots of things can happen," Trump said. "But the best would be if we could all get together and do a real health-care bill that would be good for the people, and that could very well happen." Does Trump regret starting his agenda this year with health care? "No, I don't," he said. "But in a way, I'm glad I got it out of the way." "Look, I'm a team player," Trump said of the Republican Party. "I've played this team. I've played with the team. And they just fell a little bit short, and it's very hard when you need almost 100 percent of the votes and we have no votes, zero, from the Democrats. It's unheard of." What happened with the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line conservatives he had wooed over and over again? "Ah, that's the big question," Trump said with a slight chuckle. "Don't know. I have a good relationship with them, but I couldn't get them. They just wouldn't do it." Trump alluded to long-running, simmering dramas on Capitol Hill, which he said had little to do with him, as a reason the Freedom Caucus could not back the bill. "Years of hatred and distrust," he said. "Long before me." Was Trump saying, perhaps, that the inability of Ryan and his team to work well with that caucus was part of why talks stalled? "Well, look, you can say what you want," Trump said. "But there are years of problems, great hatred and distrust, and, you know, I came into the middle of it." "I think they made a mistake, but that's okay," Trump said of the Freedom Caucus. As we wrapped up, I tried to get some clarity. The president was blaming the Democrats and was willing to let the law "explode." Yet he also seemed to be teasing the possibility of doing something bipartisan down the road, a fresh start at some point. I asked, would working on a bipartisan health-care deal a year from now be something he would find more agreeable than whipping the hard right? "A lot of people might say that," Trump said, laughing. "We'll end up with a better health-care plan, a great plan. And you wouldn't need the Freedom Caucus." What about the moderates, the entity known as the Tuesday Group? "They were great," Trump said. "They were really great." He turned once more to the Democrats. "They own it," he said. "You've said that," I told him. "This is a process," Trump concluded, "and it's going to work out very well. I was a team player, and I had an obligation to go along with this." As Trump tried to hang up the phone and get back to work, I asked him to reflect, if at all possible, on lessons learned. He's a few months into his presidency, and he had to pull a bill that he had invested time and energy into passing. What was on his mind? "Just another day," Trump said flatly. "Just another day in paradise, okay?" He paused. "Take care."

President Donald Trump's governing blueprint represents the most ambitious effort to cut domestic spending and pare back the federal government since former President Ronald Reagan came to Washington, D.C., in 1981. Whether it will come close to accomplishing the president's ambitions is a far different question. Trump's new budget proposes to raise discretionary defense spending by $54 billion in the next fiscal year and cut domestic discretionary spending by an equivalent amount, a sizable shift in priorities. To pay for his defense buildup, he would take huge chunks out of the budgets at the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies. The list of programs identified for elimination is lengthy, with targets both familiar and obscure. The president's ambitions go beyond the numbers in his new budget, however. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order designed to reorganize the executive branch. Unlike President Bill Clinton's initiative to reinvent government, Trump's order appears to be far more expansive, with a stated goal of finding programs and perhaps whole agencies that could be eliminated. "Presidents create their own eras," said John Samples of the Cato Institute. "If he did this - whatever he said in the campaign - you might see a different cycle going forward with more restraint and a reduction in the size of government. This could be the beginning of a new cycle, but he's got to get from here to there." President Donald Trump on Thursday will unveil a budget plan that calls for a sharp increase in military spending and stark cuts across much of the rest of the government including the elimination of dozens of long-standing federal programs that assist the poor, fund scientific research and aid... President Donald Trump on Thursday will unveil a budget plan that calls for a sharp increase in military spending and stark cuts across much of the rest of the government including the elimination of dozens of long-standing federal programs that assist the poor, fund scientific research and aid... That caveat - "whatever he said in the campaign" - is not insignificant. Trump has emerged in his early weeks in office as a president with an agenda to tear down parts of the federal government that he sees as superfluous or hostile to his views. Stephen Bannon, White House senior counselor and chief strategist, has talked about the "deconstruction of the administrative state." As a candidate, Trump espoused some of the goals he is following now - cutting regulations, for example - but also promised to hold harmless programs such as Social Security and Medicare and pledged a health-care program that would provide coverage to everyone while also promising major tax cuts. If he sticks to those pledges, the impact on the deficit could be significant. All this leaves open the question of what Trump's true priorities are. Are they mainly to raise defense spending, thereby being forced to find offsetting savings from domestic spending? Are they to reduce the deficit significantly, in which case what he is proposing will not go very far? Are they to take an ax to the executive branch, both through regulatory changes and the elimination of programs, in an effort to fight a bureaucracy that he appears to see as hostile to his presidency? "In terms of the overall change in direction, this is basically following the Reagan blueprint to reorder priorities in discretionary spending," said former senator Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who as a House member and "blue dog" Democrat played a key role in Reagan's first budget battle. "It would be modest in any private entity, but in government, it's significant." On Thursday, the Trump administration released a preliminary 2018 budget proposal, which details many of the changes the president wants to make to the federal government's spending. The proposal covers only discretionary, not mandatory, spending. To pay for an increase in defense spending, a down... On Thursday, the Trump administration released a preliminary 2018 budget proposal, which details many of the changes the president wants to make to the federal government's spending. The proposal covers only discretionary, not mandatory, spending. To pay for an increase in defense spending, a down... The domestic cuts proposed in Trump's new budget will produce pain and are likely to spark the same kind of backlash that has greeted past efforts. Trump enjoys the advantage of having a Congress in Republican hands, and one that includes many members who came to Washington determined to cut government's size and scope. But the built-in resistance to cuts in specific programs will test Trump's ability to shift priorities and truly shrink Washington's reach. "There aren't a lot of examples of presidents coming in and saying, 'I'm going to eliminate this program and that program and cut a whole bunch of programs back anywhere from 10 to 30 percent,' " said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "This is quite unusual." Reagan came to Washington determined to scale back the federal government. His 1981 budget and tax program did just that, cutting taxes dramatically and cutting overall projected government spending by about 5 percent and domestic discretionary spending by about 14 percent, according to Samples. When he left office after eight years, most of those programs he had cut had gotten bigger again, and those he tried to eliminate were still in existence. The reason, said Leon Panetta, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget during Clinton's administration, was the built-in obstacles that confront any president seeking to cut rather than spend. "Deep down, despite a lot of rhetoric about cutting, members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, are committed to areas of domestic spending, particularly those that affect their districts," he said. "What it means is that defense will go up, but then there will be a real game of smoke and mirrors to find a way to somehow cover those costs." President Donald Trump's budget proposal this week would shake the federal government to its core if enacted, culling back numerous programs and expediting a historic contraction of the federal workforce.

Panetta pointed out that successful efforts to attack the deficit combined cuts in defense and domestic spending, higher taxes and changes in entitlement programs. He cited the 1990 agreement between President George H.W. Bush's White House and a Democratic Congress and the deal reached by Clinton's White House and a Republican-controlled House that produced a balanced budget in the late 1990s. But deficit reduction is not necessarily Trump's top priority. His overall fiscal plan remains a work in progress. What is being released this week does not include his proposals to overhaul the tax code. But his campaign promises included cutting the corporation tax and reducing tax rates, including on wealthy individuals. The only way to increase defense spending, therefore, is to go hard after domestic spending. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was chairman of the House Budget Committee at the time of the balanced budget deal, offered this cautionary note. "Slashing is the easiest thing to do," he said. "Reforming is the hardest, but it pays the most dividends." Trump's proposed domestic cuts come after a period in which those programs have been steadily squeezed as a result of the budget sequester that went into force during President Barack Obama's administration. Alice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget and of the Congressional Budget Office, said domestic spending should be rethought rather than simply cut more. "We're spending at record lows in comparison to the size of the economy and the population for all the domestic programs we need," she said. Trump's order on reorganizing the executive branch could prove significant, if Mick Mulvaney, the new Office of Management and Budget director, fully picks up on the mandate in the directive. "It is a wide-open invitation for the OMB director to think big and to go after programs and to propose eliminations," said Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute. "I expect it to be a very bold study." Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution oversaw the government reinvention initiative during the Clinton administration, which was under the direction of Vice President Al Gore. "You have to tell big pieces of the government to stop doing stuff, and the only way to do that is to overturn statutes," she said. "That's why almost every effort has come far, far short. Despite many Republican administrations and Republican Congresses, the government is bigger than it ever was." She also said that finding substantial savings will be more difficult for the Trump administration than it was for Clinton and Gore. Many of the savings and efficiencies resulted from taking advantage of emerging technology, particularly the Internet. "We took most of those savings," she said. One priority of the new administration appears to be to change the relationship between Washington and the states and cities by devolving power away from the federal government. That was one of Reagan's goals. Many governors are anxiously watching the early moves of the Trump administration, wondering whether changes in programs, whether big-ticket ones like Medicaid or smaller programs targeted for elimination, will put greater burdens on the states unless there is significantly more flexibility built in. "It's very much a zero-sum game at the state level," said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Governors Association. "It's not like there are pots of money sitting around that can move in. If grants are cut to state and local governments, something has to give." Finally, the priorities of many Republican congressional leaders and Trump's more populist supporters may not always intersect. That, too, will be one of the balancing acts the president must manage. Gramm said successful administrations are the ones that follow the process diligently through to the end. Trump is only at the beginning.

In the closing months of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the 40th president filled a vacancy in his Cabinet and made history. Lauro Cavazos became education secretary in September 1988 and the first Latino to be confirmed for the Cabinet. He stayed on the job in the early part of George H.W. Bush's presidency before resigning amid questions about the improper use of frequent flyer miles. Ever since, there's been at least one Latino at the table in the White House Cabinet Room. Until this year. President-elect Donald Trump is set to nominate Sonny Perdue, the former Republican governor of Georgia, to serve as the next agriculture secretary, filling the final vacancy in his Cabinet. Perdue's selection, expected for weeks amid reports that he was the pick, means that Trump's Cabinet won't have a Democrat, just three women, one African American man - and no Latino in any role. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. That ends a nearly three-decade streak of Latino secretaries, top ambassadors and administrators. After Cavazos came Manuel Lujan Jr., George H.W. Bush's first interior secretary. During Bill Clinton's presidency, Federico Peña served as transportation secretary, then energy secretary. Bill Richardson later succeeded Peña at the Energy Department after serving as United Nations ambassador. Henry Cisneros served as Clinton's secretary of housing and urban development. When George W. Bush became president, he named Mel Martinez to lead HUD and Carlos Gutierrez to lead the Commerce Department. President Barack Obama has named six Latinos to serve in his Cabinet: Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Labor Secretary Hilda Solís in his first term. In his second term - under pressure to reward the nation's fastest-growing voting bloc and a community that had voted overwhelmingly for him - Obama tapped Small Business Administrator Maria Contreras Sweet, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, HUD Secretary Julián Castro and Education Secretary John King, who is black and Puerto Rican. Asked about the lack of Latino officials in the top ranks of the Trump administration, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that Trump "has continued to seek out the best and the brightest to fill his cabinet, but I don't think that that's the total reflection. We've got 5,000 positions. I think you're going to see a very, very strong presence of the Hispanic community in his administration."

Sonny Perdue to serve as agriculture secretary, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to speak publicly before it is announced.

Sonny Perdue to serve as agriculture secretary, according to a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to speak publicly before it is announced. Perdue, 70, would be the first Southerner to lead the Agriculture Department... Spicer urged reporters to look at the diversity of Trump's senior White House staffers, but there again, no Latinos - at least not yet. After a presidential campaign that launched with sharp attacks on Mexican immigrants, included vows to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, included the disparagement of a Mexican American federal judge and attacks on the nation's only Latino governor (a Republican), Latino leaders in recent weeks had expressed little hope or expectation that the Trump administration would include Latinos in top roles. During a meeting last week on Capitol Hill, dozens of Latino leaders made a last-ditch attempt to convince the Trump transition team to find a Latino to name to the Cabinet, according to participants in the meeting. They were reminded that Trump had met with two individuals, former Texas Democratic congressman Henry Bonilla and former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, about possibly serving as agriculture secretary. But both were passed over. Mario Lopez, head of the conservative Hispanic Leadership Fund, said that Perdue "seems a more than capable choice for the job. HLF would never want a quote mentality." Donald Trump met Monday with Martin Luther King III, who said he used his time with the president-elect to discuss strategies to fix the U.S.'s "broken voting system."

"But," Lopez added in an email, "not having a Latino cabinet member for the first time in years is indeed missed opportunity. We know that are are plenty of highly qualified Latinos at all levels with the principles and commitment to serve their country well." Other participants in the meeting didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Other groups, including the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, pushed Obama in the past to fill his Cabinet with more Latinos and claimed credit for helping elevate Perez, Castro and others into senior administration positions. The group was planning to mount a similar pressure campaign after November's election, circulating copies of a letter they planned to send to the transition team of Hillary Clinton - who they expected would easily defeat Trump. "We want to push hard starting tomorrow after election is over," NHLA Chairman Hector Sanchez said in an email to The Washington Post the day before the election. But Trump won - and hopes of even more Latinos in the White House Cabinet were dashed.

President Donald Trump's budget proposal this week would shake the federal government to its core if enacted, culling back numerous programs and expediting a historic contraction of the federal workforce. This would be the first time the government has executed cuts of this magnitude - and all at once - since the drawdown following World War II, economists and budget analysts said. The spending budget Trump is set to release Thursday will offer the clearest snapshot of his vision for the size and role of government. Aides say that the president sees a new Washington emerging from the budget process, one that prioritizes the military and homeland security while slashing many other areas, including housing, foreign assistance, environmental programs, public broadcasting and research. Simply put, government would be smaller and less involved in regulating life in America, with private companies and states playing a much bigger role. The cuts Trump plans to propose this week are also expected to lead to layoffs among federal workers, changes that would be felt sharply in the Washington area. According to an economic analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, the reductions outlined so far by Trump's advisers would reduce employment in the region by 1.8 percent and personal income by 3.5 percent, and lower home prices by 1.9 percent. "These are not the kind of cuts that you can accommodate by tightening the belt one notch, by shaving a little bit off of a program, or by downsizing a few staff here or there," said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "These are cuts that would require a wholesale triage of a vast array of federal activities." Still, budget experts said it was unclear what the precise impact on many agencies might be because the departments could choose to implement reductions in a variety of ways. The Trump administration has considered more than $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to preliminary budget documents obtained by The Washington Post. The plan would squeeze public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants,... The Trump administration has considered more than $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to preliminary budget documents obtained by The Washington Post. The plan would squeeze public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants,... Administration officials have also stressed that discussions are ongoing between budget officials and agencies, and that the size of the budget cuts remains fluid. Moreover, the cuts cannot take effect unless they are authorized by Congress, which could prove difficult. Lawmakers routinely rebuffed budget requests from President Barack Obama, leading instead to protracted negotiations between both sides. Already, Democrats have vowed to fight Trump's proposals, and some Republicans have also expressed unease at the size of the reductions. The White House declined to comment publicly, but administration officials have signaled for weeks that large cuts will be part of the budget. "Unfortunately, we have no alternative but to reinvest in our military and make ourselves a military power once again," National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said on "Fox News Sunday." President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash one of the government's premier climate science agencies by 17 percent, delivering steep cuts to research funding and satellite programs, according to a four-page budget memo obtained by The Washington Post. The proposed cuts to the National... President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash one of the government's premier climate science agencies by 17 percent, delivering steep cuts to research funding and satellite programs, according to a four-page budget memo obtained by The Washington Post. The proposed cuts to the National... "If you're doing that in an area where you have to balance the budget and you cannot create a further deficit, you have to make cuts. It's no different than every other family in America that has to make the tough decisions when they need to spend money somewhere, they have to cut it from somewhere else." The federal government is projected to spend $4.091 trillion next year, with roughly two-thirds of that going mostly toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, poverty assistance and interest payments on the government debt. This spending is expected to be left untouched in the budget proposal next week. What Trump will propose changing is the rest of the budget, known as discretionary spending, which is authorized each year by Congress. Slightly more than half of this remaining money goes to the military, and the rest is spread across agencies that operate things like education, diplomacy, housing, transportation and law enforcement. Among Trump's expected proposals are an increase in military spending of $54 billion, more money to start building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, and the creation of new initiatives that expand access to charter schools and other educational programs. To offset that new money, Trump will propose steep cuts across numerous other agencies. Although final numbers remain in flux, his advisers have considered cutting the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget by $6 billion, or 14 percent, according to a preliminary budget document obtained by The Washington Post. That is a change that Trulia chief economist Ralph McLaughlin said could "put nearly 8 million Americans in both inner-city and suburban communities at risk of losing their public housing and nearly 4 million at risk of losing their rental subsidy." Preliminary budget documents have also shown that Trump advisers have also looked at cutting the Environmental Protect Agency's staff by about 20 percent and tightening the Commerce Department's budget by about 18 percent, which would impact climate change research and weather satellite programs, among other things. Trump and his advisers have said that they believe the federal workforce is too big, and that the federal government spends - and wastes - too much money. They have said that Washington - the federal workers and contractors, among others - has benefited from government largesse while many other Americans have suffered. Federal spending, they have argued, crowds the private sector and piles regulations and bureaucracy onto companies. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, has said Trump will lead a "deconstruction of the administrative state." On Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Obama loyalists had "burrowed into government." Last month, Trump said the government would have to "do more with less." Trump's proposal comes at a time when the federal budget is facing massive structural shifts in society and the economy. Aging baby boomers are swelling the number of Americans collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits, and the costs of these programs will continue to grow faster for more than a decade, budget experts said. In addition, the expected rise in borrowing rates and the growing national debt are expected to push interest payments on the debt from $270 billion this year to $768 billion in 2027, outpacing any growth in tax revenue. The spending cuts Trump will propose Thursday will not impact any of these spending trajectories, though many conservatives have urged him to tackle these parts of the budget more comprehensively. "It is his vision for the administration of the government," said Doug Holtz-Eakin, another former CBO director. "But the big government that everyone decries," he said, is in other programs that Trump is not proposing yet to cut. Meanwhile, the aging federal workforce is moving more people toward retirement and into federal pension programs. There are roughly 2.8 million federal employees, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a number roughly flat over the past 20 years but lower than any point from 1974 to 1997. And roughly 34 percent of the federal employees who are not in the military will qualify for full retirement benefits in 2020. Trump's proposal is a continuation of a messy Washington fight about the size and scope of the federal budget, which has led to some changes in recent years but nothing as stark as what he will propose this week. Federal spending grew and then contracted during the Obama administration. A combination of the recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other initiatives pushed federal spending to $3.5 trillion in 2010 and $3.6 trillion in 2011. Those annual spending levels, combined with a weak economic recovery, amounted to 23.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, the largest percentage since 1946. But then the stimulus funds ended, the Obama administration and Congress agreed to install new budget caps and other spending waned. In 2017, spending as a share of GDP is expected to be 20.7 percent, more in line with historical trends. But those budget caps are at the crux of Trump's looming fight with Democrats. Many have insisted that they will only agree to increases in defense spending if other parts of the budget are increased as well. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who said that his state would be hit particularly hard by Trump's proposed cuts, said that his party plans to remain locked in opposition to the disproportionate changes Trump will advance. "The notion of bulking up defense but slashing everything else, that's not going to find any votes on the Democratic side," Kaine said in an interview. Neither Trump nor any of his top advisers have assembled a White House budget before, posing a challenge for his team in how it sells it and for lawmakers from both parties as they decide whether to negotiate or block his proposed changes. But former White House officials from both parties agree that the changes Trump proposes, if enacted, would dramatically change how the federal government functions and its role in American society. Matthew Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, said many of the cuts the Trump administration will propose would impact what he sees as investments in the United States' future, such as health research, transportation projects and training programs. "Imagine his plan got enacted," Slaughter said. "It wouldn't trigger some crisis, but what's subtle is relative to what America could be in the next several years in terms of making more substantial investments in infrastructure, science research, and public investments that we have historically made." Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said on Hugh Hewitt's radio program last week that it was important for the administration to change how Washington thinks. "We don't solve problems by simply throwing money at them," he said.

Donald Trump met Monday with Martin Luther King III, who said he used his time with the president-elect to discuss strategies to fix the U.S.'s "broken voting system." The oldest son of the civil rights leader trekked to Trump Tower amid renewed tensions between the incoming president and African Americans over Trump's weekend twitter attack on another civil rights icon, Georgia Congressman John Lewis. King told reporters his conversation with Trump focused on boosting voting rights for those who feel their freedoms are under threat. "We did have a very constructive meeting," said King, who arrived at Trump Tower on the U.S. holiday honoring his father. Trump has said that he is going to represent all Americans and "I believe that is his intent," King added. Trump didn't take questions from reporters following the meeting. King III has advocated for the government to issue free photo-identification cards that citizens could use to vote if they lack a driver's license or another form of official ID. He said he would like Trump to direct the Social Security Administration to put a photo on the Social Security card of anyone who seeks such identification, or to direct the State Department to waive the $55 passport card fee for low-income Americans. "Either approach is within the president's authority and would impose minimal costs to secure the most fundamental right for all Americans -- a right that most people consider priceless," King wrote in a Washington Post commentary. As Americans celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights leaders and activists are trying to reconcile the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most non-white voters.

As Americans celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights leaders and activists are trying to reconcile the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most non-white voters. In more than one venue Monday, speakers and... King wrote that minority vote totals had fallen from previous elections in battleground states that were key to Trump's victory, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The declines may be attributable to legislative efforts intended to make it harder to vote, King wrote. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on Twitter Monday morning that the meeting with King III was intended to discuss his late father's legacy. Trump was initially planning to travel to Washington Monday to visit the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture, but canceled because of scheduling issues, ABC News reported, citing transition sources. A growing number of Democratic lawmakers have said they won't attend Trump's inauguration later this week following his criticism of Lewis, whose district includes much of Atlanta. The incoming president posted on Twitter Saturday that Lewis "should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk -- no action or results. Sad!" Marchers rallied in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day march that was at times also a rally against president-elect Donald Trump. The tweets came after Lewis, 76, said he didn't consider Trump a "legitimate president" because Russians helped him get elected. Lewis, who worked closely with Martin Luther King during the 1960s and suffered a cracked skull protesting for voting rights, made the comments in an interview with NBC News. "In the heat of emotion, a lot of things get said on both sides," King III said in response to reporters' questions about the spat between Trump and Lewis. Trump has repeatedly rejected suggestions that hacking by Russia or other actors helped him win. He did concede last week that the Russian government was behind the hacking of Democratic Party computers and the leaking of internal e-mails, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded. --With assistance from Toluse Olorunnipa

President Trump and House Republicans, in their rush to resuscitate a bill rolling back the Affordable Care Act, are increasingly isolating themselves from outside input and rejecting entreaties to work collaboratively, according to multiple healthcare officials who have tried to engage GOP leaders. Despite pressure from the White House, House GOP leaders determined Thursday night that they didn't have the votes to pass a rewrite of the Affordable Care Act and would not seek to put their proposal on the floor on Friday, according to the Washington Post. The failure of Republicans to unite behind the new health-care measure was a blow to White House officials, who were eager to see a vote ahead of President Donald Trump's 100-day mark. Congressional leaders were more focused this week on securing a spending agreement to keep the government open past midnight on Friday, according to multiple people involved in the discussions who spoke to the Washington Post on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk publicly. But GOP leaders continue to refuse to reach out to Democrats. Even Senate Republicans have been largely sidelined, though their support will be crucial to putting a measure on Trump’s desk. And senior House Republicans and White House officials have almost completely shut out doctors, hospitals, patient advocates and others who work in the healthcare system, industry officials say, despite pleas from many healthcare leaders to seek an alternative path that doesn’t threaten protections for tens of millions of Americans. Republicans said they would push a short-term spending bill — essential to keeping the government open — through the House Friday with only GOP votes, if necessary. The brinkmanship came less than 30 hours before a midnight Friday deadline for a shutdown. At the same time, a House GOP leader said... Republicans said they would push a short-term spending bill — essential to keeping the government open — through the House Friday with only GOP votes, if necessary. The brinkmanship came less than 30 hours before a midnight Friday deadline for a shutdown. At the same time, a House GOP leader said... “To think you are going to revamp the entire American healthcare system without involving any of the people who actually deliver healthcare is insanity,” said Sister Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Assn., whose members include many of the nation’s largest medical systems. Health insurers, who initially found House Republicans and Trump administration officials open to suggestions for improving insurance markets, say it is increasingly difficult to have realistic discussions, according to numerous industry officials. “They’re not interested in how health policy actually works,” said one insurance company official, who asked not to be identified discussing conversations with GOP officials. “It’s incredibly frustrating.” Another longtime healthcare lobbyist, who also did not want to be identified criticizing Republicans, said he’d never seen legislation developed with such disregard for expert input. “It is totally divorced from reality,” he said. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The conservative House Freedom Caucus announced its support Wednesday for a newly revised GOP health care bill, a month after the group's opposition forced Republican leaders to pull the legislation in an embarrassing retreat.The group's support, while significant, does not necessarily guarantee... The conservative House Freedom Caucus announced its support Wednesday for a newly revised GOP health care bill, a month after the group's opposition forced Republican leaders to pull the legislation in an embarrassing retreat.The group's support, while significant, does not necessarily guarantee... Trump and senior House Republicans have steadfastly defended their bill, however, promising it would lower healthcare costs while preserving protections for vulnerable Americans. “The plan gets better and better and better,” Trump said last week at the White House. “And it’s gotten really, really good. And a lot of people are liking it a lot.” House Republican leaders are now working to win over wavering members of their caucus with a proposed amendment making it easier for states to drop key protections in the current law that, among other things, prohibit insurers from charging sick people more for coverage. “What this amendment does is it gives states more flexibility and tools to reduce premiums and increase choices,” Ryan, of Wisconsin, said Thursday, explaining states would still have to assure coverage is available for sick consumers, even if they are priced out of the market. But not a single major group representing doctors, hospitals and patients supported the original House legislation, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million over the next decade. Opposition among those who work in healthcare has only deepened amid the current GOP efforts to win over conservative lawmakers with the new amendment, with the American Medical Assn. and the American Hospital Assn. restating their rejection of the House legislation. The American Cancer Society’s advocacy arm — one of many leading groups representing patients with serious illnesses who have spoken out against the GOP campaign to repeal Obamacare — warned of the return of “a patchwork system of health coverage in which patients with preexisting conditions in some states would no longer be protected.” The powerful AARP said that provisions in the House bill would push up insurance costs for older Americans while doing nothing to tackle high prescription drug costs. And on Wednesday, a coalition of six leading physician groups representing more than 560,000 doctors — including pediatricians, family physicians and obstetricians — urged congressional leaders to put aside the House GOP legislation and work with doctors on an alternative that would not jeopardize insurance coverage for millions of Americans. “Our members see firsthand the important role that healthcare coverage and access to affordable, high-quality care plays in people’s lives and their pursuit of better health and well-being,” the groups wrote. “They also recall those days when patients faced discrimination based on their age, gender or health conditions, and remember when those with mental and behavioral health needs were denied coverage.” The House legislation would dismantle Obamacare’s extensive system for expanding health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, cutting nearly $1 trillion in federal aid that has allowed states to expand the Medicaid safety net programs and scaling back tax subsidies that help millions of low- and middle-income Americans buy commercial healthcare plans. A proposed amendment to the bill that House Republicans are now considering could also weaken other consumer protections in the current law, including mandates that require health insurers to cover basic benefits such as mental health and maternity care. At the same time, the House bill would repeal major taxes that the current law imposed to fund the expansion of health coverage. That would deliver major tax breaks to the medical device and insurance industries and to wealthy Americans. The House bill also scraps the unpopular requirement in the current law that Americans have insurance or pay a penalty. The House bill is deeply unpopular, with polls showing fewer than one in five Americans backing the legislation. Even many Republican senators — including conservatives such as Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — have voiced deep reservations about the legislation. And after the bill appeared to collapse last month when GOP leaders didn’t have enough votes to bring it to the House floor, many who work in the healthcare system pleaded with the White House and congressional Republicans to undertake a new, more collaborative approach. “This is not a problem either party can solve alone, but it is solvable with bipartisan efforts,” the Catholic Health Assn. noted at the time. Rohit Kumar, who was a senior aide to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), said that imperative remains even more crucial today. “If you’re going to make progress, you’re going to have to bring in more stakeholders,” said Kumar, a leading tax and healthcare advisor at consulting giant PwC. That simply hasn’t happened, according to multiple healthcare leaders. When asked if he’d been contacted by any Republican leaders for suggestions about ways to improve the legislation that failed last month, a senior lobbyist at one leading patient advocacy group simply laughed out loud.

Republicans said they would push a short-term spending bill — essential to keeping the government open — through the House Friday with only GOP votes, if necessary. The brinkmanship came less than 30 hours before a midnight Friday deadline for a shutdown. At the same time, a House GOP leader said late Thursday that there would be no vote on major GOP health care legislation until at least next week. That meant that on both the budget and health care fronts, there would be no milestone victories for Trump before Saturday, his 100th day as president. "We're working on the funding of government. We're getting that through" on Friday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said of the temporary spending measure. Asked by reporters whether Republicans would have to pass the short-term bill without Democratic votes, McCarthy said, "Yeah." Democrats have threatened to oppose the temporary spending bill if there wasn't a bipartisan deal on a $1 trillion measure financing the government through September. Final agreement on some loose ends in that massive measure has remained elusive. President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... Republicans had been hoping for Democratic support because a significant number of conservative GOP lawmakers often vote against spending legislation. McCarthy told reporters late Thursday that the health care vote would not occur Friday or Saturday. "As soon as we have the votes, we'll vote on it," he said after leaving a House GOP leadership meeting that lasted nearly two hours. Across the Capitol, Senate Democrats late Thursday blocked a quick vote on a short-term spending bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressed for an agreement on the short-term legislation that will carry through next week. That would give lawmakers more time to complete negotiations on the $1 trillion measure. One potential obstacle in the negotiations to prevent a government shutdown was averted Wednesday when the White House announced it would continue — at least for now — to provide critical funding for the Affordable Care Act. President Trump had once threatened to withhold money that helps many... One potential obstacle in the negotiations to prevent a government shutdown was averted Wednesday when the White House announced it would continue — at least for now — to provide critical funding for the Affordable Care Act. President Trump had once threatened to withhold money that helps many... Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that any vote only occur when Republicans abandon efforts to add provisions on abortion, financial regulations and the environment to the legislation. "Our position has been clear and it's nothing news. No poison-pill riders," Schumer said. The House is scheduled to vote on the one-week extension Friday morning and the Senate could still vote ahead of the deadline. Besides not finishing the $1 trillion measure, the House GOP abandoned hopes of giving Trump a victory on health care before his 100th day. A revised health care bill has won the support of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, holdouts on an earlier version that collapsed last month, but GOP leaders were struggling to round up votes from moderate-leaning Republicans. Trump himself unleashed a tweetstorm of criticism of Democrats involved in negotiations on the spending bill. "Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies. It is time to put #AmericaFirst," he tweeted. Democrats dismissed such accusations. "We are never going to shut government down. In fact, we don't even have the power to do so," said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Referring to Republicans, she said: "They have the majority. They have the president. They have the Senate. They have the House. Any shutting down of government, the ball is in their court." Nonetheless, leaders in both parties projected certainty that a deal would ultimately be reached on the spending legislation, which covers all government agencies and is leftover business from last year. "Talks on government funding legislation have continued throughout the week on a bipartisan, bicameral basis," said McConnell, R-Ky. The talks involving congressional Republicans and Democrats had progressed relatively smoothly after the White House earlier this week backed off a threat to withhold payments that help lower-income Americans pay their medical bills and Trump dropped a demand for money for the border wall. After the U.S.-Mexico wall issue and the Obamacare controversy were addressed, negotiators turned to a lengthy roster of unfinished issues, many of which involve extraneous policy "riders" on the environment and financial services regulations. "Now we're making progress — we're not there yet," said Schumer, D-N.Y. Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Kevin Freking, Richard Lardner and Alan Fram contributed to this report.

President Donald Trump "has no intention" of releasing his tax returns to the public, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Wednesday, asserting Americans have "plenty of information" about the president's financial matters. For decades, presidents have released their tax returns. But Trump has so far refused, saying that he would share the tax documents only after the Internal Revenue Service completes an "audit" of them. He's never disclosed proof of an audit and tax lawyers say there's nothing preventing him from releasing his returns if he's under one. Trump said before he launched his campaign that he'd release them if he ever ran for office. "If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely," he told an Irish television station in 2014. "And I would love to do that." Mnuchin appeared to close the door completely Wednesday. President Donald Trump proposed dramatic cuts in corporate and personal taxes Wednesday in an overhaul his administration asserts will spur national economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to America's middle class.

President Donald Trump proposed dramatic cuts in corporate and personal taxes Wednesday in an overhaul his administration asserts will spur national economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to America's middle class. But his ambitious plan is alarming lawmakers who worry it will balloon federal... "The president has no intention. The president has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information," he said, inaccurately characterizing the president's disclosures. The comment came as the secretary briefed reporters on the president's new proposal to overhaul taxes. Democrats have sought to use the tax debate to pressure Trump to release his returns, arguing the information is necessary to evaluate how Trump's tax proposals would affect his personal wealth and his business' bottom line. Mnuchin declined to comment on how Trump would benefit from his proposals. He and other administration officials left the room as reporters shouted questions about how the plan would affect the Trump family. Trump, a billionaire, owns a global real estate, marketing and property management company, which at the start of his presidency he placed in a trust that he can revoke at any time. His daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers, are also holding onto significant business assets. And Trump's adult sons run his Trump Organization. Trump officials have offered varying explanations for why the president does not disclosure his returns. White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview in January that the fact that he won the election without putting out the information shows that "people didn't care" about it. Independent budget experts say rate reductions proposed by the Trump administration could cost the federal government $2.4 trillion over a decade. (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Independent budget experts say rate reductions proposed by the Trump administration could cost the federal government $2.4 trillion over a decade. (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have made similar points in various interviews, though recent polling suggests otherwise. There's evidence the president has been thinking about the issue in recent weeks. He asked his friend and Las Vegas business partner Phil Ruffin, a fellow billionaire, whether he should put out the returns, Ruffin said. "I advised him not to," Ruffin said. "It's a waste of time, and he'll spend years explaining them and never get to accomplishing any of his goals." Ruffin said he told the president that Democrats would hire "armies of accountants" to pore over the documents and "make an issue out of any and everything." Even with Mnuchin's seemingly definitive answer, the issue of Trump's tax returns isn't likely to go away. Democrats have threatened to hold up his tax proposals until they see the returns. Thousands of sign-waving, chanting protesters have marched through streets across America demanding that President Donald Trump release his tax returns so the public can examine his business ties and determine whether he has links to foreign powers.

Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called Trump's tax plan "unprincipled" — and one that "will result in cuts for the one percent, conflicts for the president, crippling debt for America and crumbs for the working people." Democrats also have been pushing for a vote on a bill that would require the president and all major-party nominees to publicly disclose their previous three years of tax returns with the Office of Government Ethics or the Federal Election Commission. On Wednesday, Democratic members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Chairman Jason Chaffetz requesting that he allow a vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. "As Members of Congress, we have the ability and duty to legislate in order to promote government transparency, combat conflicts of interest, and ensure compliance with the Constitution," they wrote. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland also slammed Trump's tax plan as "a half-baked collection of ideas that add up to a huge giveaway to Donald Trump and his rich friends." "If your last name is Trump," he added, "this plan is great for your bottom line."

President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters Monday evening that he would be willing to return to the wall funding issue in September, according to two people who were in the room. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the get-together, which was not originally intended to be on the record. The border wall money is fiercely opposed by Democrats, whose votes are needed to pass the government-wide spending legislation that comes due Friday at midnight. The wall is also unpopular with many Republicans, and GOP negotiators on Capitol Hill were uneasy about the clash over the wall potentially sparking a government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who has a key role providing Democratic votes to pass the legislation, welcomed Trump's reported shift on the wall. "It's good for the country that President Trump is taking the wall off the table in these negotiations," Schumer said late Monday. "Now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues." The wall was the most pressing issue confronting lawmakers as they returned from a two-week spring recess to face a critical deadline. Congress must pass a $1 trillion catch-all spending bill to pay for all agencies of government or trigger a partial shutdown Saturday, which happens to coincide with the 100th day of Trump's presidency. "I'm optimistic. I don't think anybody wants a shutdown," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said as he exited a meeting of GOP leadership. "The White House and basically the minority leaders of the House and Senate have to have some level of agreement on the things that you're adding." The negotiations over the spending bill took center stage Monday despite a separate White House push for fast action to revive health care legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. After signaling last week that they hoped for a vote as soon as this week on a rewritten health bill, White House officials softened their stance Monday. Echoing the views of House GOP leaders, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said there would be a vote on health care legislation when House leaders count the 216 votes needed to pass it. "I think we want to make sure that we've got the votes and we're headed in the right direction before putting some artificial deadline," Spicer said. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan were embarrassed last month when they had to pull their "Obamacare" replacement bill off the floor without a vote as it became clear it would fail. Since then leaders of conservative and moderate factions in the House have been negotiating on a compromise allowing states to opt out of certain "Obamacare" requirements, and they appear to be making progress, although legislative text had not been finalized as of Monday.

At the Boys and Girls Club in this rural city in southern Oklahoma, the director is unsure how he will stay open if President Donald Trump's proposed budget goes through, eliminating money for several staff positions. Similar conversations are happening at the Oklahoma Shakespearean Festival's... The original GOP bill eliminated many of the "Obamacare" mandates, offered skimpier subsidies for consumers to buy care and rolled back a Medicaid expansion. Conservatives balked, saying it didn't go far enough. With Democrats unanimously opposed, it remains to be seen whether the health care deal will come together and attract the needed support. Trump talked it up on Twitter, writing Monday: "If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare is in a death spiral!" Trump also pushed for his border wall, a central campaign pledge that he still insists Mexico will pay for in the end, though Democrats and even most Republicans doubt that will ever come to pass. Cost estimates range past $20 billion and the White House had been seeking $1.4 billion as a down payment in the spending bill. Trump turned again to Twitter: "The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! #BuildTheWall." But some of the conservative journalists who met Monday evening with Trump reported he said wall funding could wait until the fall. Prior to the White House demand late last week for border wall money, it had largely been assumed on Capitol Hill that the spending measure would include funding for additional security steps along the border, but that there wouldn't be any money explicitly dedicated for new wall construction. That approach now appears likely to prevail. The other major stumbling block on the spending bill involves a demand by Democratic negotiators that the measure fund cost-sharing payments to insurance companies that help low-income people afford health policies under Obama's health law, or that Trump back off a threat to use the payments as a bargaining chip.

Congress is off for two weeks, and when lawmakers return, they will quickly face a critical deadline to keep the government open. But in an unusual development on Capitol Hill, where budget brinkmanship has become a reliable expression of political dysfunction, nobody is threatening to shut the government down. Instead, Republicans and Democrats appear to be working together to keep the lights on in Washington. Aides in both parties said negotiations are underway on a stopgap funding measure that both sides could support, one that sidesteps such political land mines as President Donald Trump's request for new funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., sounded a note of optimism as his chamber adjourned for its Easter break. He told reporters that bipartisan support would be needed not only for the stopgap measure, which would fund the government through September, but also for the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to fund government operations in the months beyond. None of those bills "can be done one party only," McConnell, R-Ky., said. "All of that will have to be done on a bipartisan basis. And I think — the Democratic leader can speak for himself — but I'm confident he looks at it the same way." The bipartisan bonhomie marks a refreshing break from the dark days of spending fights that descended on the Capitol after the 2010 elections swept a wave of hard-line conservative tea party candidates into office. Since then, the GOP's right flank has taken an aggressive stance on cutting federal spending, threatening repeatedly to shut down the government or even default on the nation's debts in hopes of securing an agreement to slash spending. That has forced Republican House leaders to turn to Democrats for the votes to push must-pass measures over the finish line to raise the federal debt limit and finance the government. After 10 weeks of pinballing through political and domestic fiascos largely of his own making, President Trump last week faced the kinds of wrenching external challenges no White House occupant can avoid for long. “No child of God should ever suffer such horror,” Trump said emotionally Thursday... After 10 weeks of pinballing through political and domestic fiascos largely of his own making, President Trump last week faced the kinds of wrenching external challenges no White House occupant can avoid for long. “No child of God should ever suffer such horror,” Trump said emotionally Thursday... The difference this time is that Republican leaders are turning to Democrats from the get-go, a decision that will produce less drama in the halls of Congress but is likely to make it much harder to craft a budget that matches Trump's ambitions on an array of fronts, from the border wall to a big increase in defense spending. In an interview Friday, McConnell told The Washington Post that he is unsure how to square that circle. But he was insistent that Democrats need to play a part in the negotiations. "It seems to me that neither side benefits from sort of a government-shutdown scenario again in September," McConnell said. "Exactly how we get from here to there, I couldn't tell you today." The spending measure expires April 28, just four days after lawmakers return from their Easter break. House Republicans are bitterly divided and aimless after the collapse of a plan by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Still angry over that grueling battle, the right wing of Ryan's caucus is not expected to support a measure to keep the government open past the April deadline, though that is far from settled. The Republican health care bill remained in shambles Thursday as House leaders threw up their hands and sent lawmakers home for a two-week recess. GOP chiefs announced a modest amendment to curb premium increases, but internal divisions still blocked their promised repeal of former President Barack... The Republican health care bill remained in shambles Thursday as House leaders threw up their hands and sent lawmakers home for a two-week recess. GOP chiefs announced a modest amendment to curb premium increases, but internal divisions still blocked their promised repeal of former President Barack... So Ryan has turned for help to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Last week, Pelosi said lawmakers from both parties were working well together to craft a stopgap spending measure. But she predicted that the measure's fate would ultimately be in Trump's hands. Trump, for example, could refuse to sign a funding measure that doesn't include money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Such funding is a non-starter with Democrats, as are any other policy changes that could be construed as a win for the president. "Members of Congress know what they can pass. Maybe the White House doesn't," Pelosi said. "And that's — that line of communication is where you might see some — more difference of opinion than even between Democrats and Republicans in the Congress." If they clear the April 28 hurdle, Republican lawmakers and aides are already worrying privately that a larger spending battle looms over Trump's budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Most Democrats and many Republicans have roundly criticized Trump's plan to increase the defense budget by $54 billion — money that would be carved directly out of the budgets of domestic agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the Agriculture Department. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., said Trump's request has put Republicans in a difficult situation. Trump has promised voters that Republicans will expand the military, regain control of government spending and overhaul the federal government without cutting safety-net programs for older and poorer Americans — a promise many lawmakers see as mathematically impossible. Conservatives like Sanford say Washington will never get its fiscal house in order without reining in spending on such popular programs as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, which together make up about half of federal spending. "What you have is a mousetrap," Sanford said. "Back home, you've got the mayor of North Charleston riding around in a Meals on Wheels truck saying, 'I don't think we should cut this' — and he was an early Trump supporter." The White House has been closely monitoring preliminary talks about fiscal 2018 spending bills, according to Republican aides who were granted anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Last week, Ryan said he is optimistic about budget deals because there is a Republican in the White House. "The good news is we don't have to deal with the Obama administration," Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference. "We don't have to fight an administration that we disagree with on so many issues. We are now working with an administration we agree with." But it's far from clear that Ryan's rank-and-file will line up behind him. Conservatives are still angry that Ryan persuaded them to try to roll back the Affordable Care Act by using a special budget procedure known as "reconciliation" that would have made it easier to push a bill through the Senate. The repeal effort unraveled when Ryan could not build a coalition of moderates and conservatives large enough to approve a rewrite of the health-care law. Many conservatives are wary of making the same mistake in the 2018 spending measure. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C. — one of the holdouts on health care — was among several conservatives who warned recently that they wouldn't support a spending bill just to avert a shutdown. Meadows said conservatives are particularly concerned about where any budget bill sets overall spending levels for government agencies. "Now you're going to be setting top-line numbers, which you appropriate to," Meadows said. "That will have a unique dynamic, let's put it that way." Hard-liners are also expected to balk at efforts to use reconciliation procedures to advance a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, another top priority for Ryan and Trump. These lawmakers say they will not necessarily support a tax overhaul if it is accompanied by higher spending. "I think it's more important that we take a look at the budget and make sure that it meets the principles we're trying to move forward," said Freedom Caucus member H. Morgan Griffith, R-Va. Griffith said any spending increases must be paired with cuts elsewhere or with policies to rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare, which is rising rapidly as the baby-boom generation retires. A large number of conservatives voted against each of the last three spending measures over those same concerns. The most consequential fight came in 2015, when Republican leaders were forced to turn to Democrats to avert a government shutdown. The result was a two-year compromise that increased spending across the board and ensured equal funding for domestic and military programs. That agreement is set to expire at the end of September, and GOP leaders have begun to fret quietly over what will happen. Meanwhile, Democrats are eagerly laying plans to swoop in with a budget compromise if Ryan cannot solve the problems that have riven the lower chamber for the past six years. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who serves on the Senate Budget Committee, said last week that Democrats would offer a spending blueprint to counter Trump's budget request. "It has to be defeated and we will come up with alternatives." Sanders said. Democrats will not support "tax breaks for millionaires ... and cuts to programs that people desperately need."

President Donald Trump's budget proposal this week would shake the federal government to its core if enacted, culling back numerous programs and expediting a historic contraction of the federal workforce. This would be the first time the government has executed cuts of this magnitude - and all at once - since the drawdown following World War II, economists and budget analysts said. The spending budget Trump is set to release Thursday will offer the clearest snapshot of his vision for the size and role of government. Aides say that the president sees a new Washington emerging from the budget process, one that prioritizes the military and homeland security while slashing many other areas, including housing, foreign assistance, environmental programs, public broadcasting and research. Simply put, government would be smaller and less involved in regulating life in America, with private companies and states playing a much bigger role. The cuts Trump plans to propose this week are also expected to lead to layoffs among federal workers, changes that would be felt sharply in the Washington area. According to an economic analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, the reductions outlined so far by Trump's advisers would reduce employment in the region by 1.8 percent and personal income by 3.5 percent, and lower home prices by 1.9 percent. "These are not the kind of cuts that you can accommodate by tightening the belt one notch, by shaving a little bit off of a program, or by downsizing a few staff here or there," said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "These are cuts that would require a wholesale triage of a vast array of federal activities." Still, budget experts said it was unclear what the precise impact on many agencies might be because the departments could choose to implement reductions in a variety of ways. The Trump administration has considered more than $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to preliminary budget documents obtained by The Washington Post. The plan would squeeze public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants,... The Trump administration has considered more than $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to preliminary budget documents obtained by The Washington Post. The plan would squeeze public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants,... Administration officials have also stressed that discussions are ongoing between budget officials and agencies, and that the size of the budget cuts remains fluid. Moreover, the cuts cannot take effect unless they are authorized by Congress, which could prove difficult. Lawmakers routinely rebuffed budget requests from President Barack Obama, leading instead to protracted negotiations between both sides. Already, Democrats have vowed to fight Trump's proposals, and some Republicans have also expressed unease at the size of the reductions. The White House declined to comment publicly, but administration officials have signaled for weeks that large cuts will be part of the budget. "Unfortunately, we have no alternative but to reinvest in our military and make ourselves a military power once again," National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said on "Fox News Sunday." President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash one of the government's premier climate science agencies by 17 percent, delivering steep cuts to research funding and satellite programs, according to a four-page budget memo obtained by The Washington Post. The proposed cuts to the National... President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash one of the government's premier climate science agencies by 17 percent, delivering steep cuts to research funding and satellite programs, according to a four-page budget memo obtained by The Washington Post. The proposed cuts to the National... "If you're doing that in an area where you have to balance the budget and you cannot create a further deficit, you have to make cuts. It's no different than every other family in America that has to make the tough decisions when they need to spend money somewhere, they have to cut it from somewhere else." The federal government is projected to spend $4.091 trillion next year, with roughly two-thirds of that going mostly toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, poverty assistance and interest payments on the government debt. This spending is expected to be left untouched in the budget proposal next week. What Trump will propose changing is the rest of the budget, known as discretionary spending, which is authorized each year by Congress. Slightly more than half of this remaining money goes to the military, and the rest is spread across agencies that operate things like education, diplomacy, housing, transportation and law enforcement. Among Trump's expected proposals are an increase in military spending of $54 billion, more money to start building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, and the creation of new initiatives that expand access to charter schools and other educational programs. To offset that new money, Trump will propose steep cuts across numerous other agencies. Although final numbers remain in flux, his advisers have considered cutting the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget by $6 billion, or 14 percent, according to a preliminary budget document obtained by The Washington Post. That is a change that Trulia chief economist Ralph McLaughlin said could "put nearly 8 million Americans in both inner-city and suburban communities at risk of losing their public housing and nearly 4 million at risk of losing their rental subsidy." Preliminary budget documents have also shown that Trump advisers have also looked at cutting the Environmental Protect Agency's staff by about 20 percent and tightening the Commerce Department's budget by about 18 percent, which would impact climate change research and weather satellite programs, among other things. Trump and his advisers have said that they believe the federal workforce is too big, and that the federal government spends - and wastes - too much money. They have said that Washington - the federal workers and contractors, among others - has benefited from government largesse while many other Americans have suffered. Federal spending, they have argued, crowds the private sector and piles regulations and bureaucracy onto companies. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, has said Trump will lead a "deconstruction of the administrative state." On Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Obama loyalists had "burrowed into government." Last month, Trump said the government would have to "do more with less." Trump's proposal comes at a time when the federal budget is facing massive structural shifts in society and the economy. Aging baby boomers are swelling the number of Americans collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits, and the costs of these programs will continue to grow faster for more than a decade, budget experts said. In addition, the expected rise in borrowing rates and the growing national debt are expected to push interest payments on the debt from $270 billion this year to $768 billion in 2027, outpacing any growth in tax revenue. The spending cuts Trump will propose Thursday will not impact any of these spending trajectories, though many conservatives have urged him to tackle these parts of the budget more comprehensively. "It is his vision for the administration of the government," said Doug Holtz-Eakin, another former CBO director. "But the big government that everyone decries," he said, is in other programs that Trump is not proposing yet to cut. Meanwhile, the aging federal workforce is moving more people toward retirement and into federal pension programs. There are roughly 2.8 million federal employees, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a number roughly flat over the past 20 years but lower than any point from 1974 to 1997. And roughly 34 percent of the federal employees who are not in the military will qualify for full retirement benefits in 2020. Trump's proposal is a continuation of a messy Washington fight about the size and scope of the federal budget, which has led to some changes in recent years but nothing as stark as what he will propose this week. Federal spending grew and then contracted during the Obama administration. A combination of the recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other initiatives pushed federal spending to $3.5 trillion in 2010 and $3.6 trillion in 2011. Those annual spending levels, combined with a weak economic recovery, amounted to 23.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, the largest percentage since 1946. But then the stimulus funds ended, the Obama administration and Congress agreed to install new budget caps and other spending waned. In 2017, spending as a share of GDP is expected to be 20.7 percent, more in line with historical trends. But those budget caps are at the crux of Trump's looming fight with Democrats. Many have insisted that they will only agree to increases in defense spending if other parts of the budget are increased as well. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who said that his state would be hit particularly hard by Trump's proposed cuts, said that his party plans to remain locked in opposition to the disproportionate changes Trump will advance. "The notion of bulking up defense but slashing everything else, that's not going to find any votes on the Democratic side," Kaine said in an interview. Neither Trump nor any of his top advisers have assembled a White House budget before, posing a challenge for his team in how it sells it and for lawmakers from both parties as they decide whether to negotiate or block his proposed changes. But former White House officials from both parties agree that the changes Trump proposes, if enacted, would dramatically change how the federal government functions and its role in American society. Matthew Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, said many of the cuts the Trump administration will propose would impact what he sees as investments in the United States' future, such as health research, transportation projects and training programs. "Imagine his plan got enacted," Slaughter said. "It wouldn't trigger some crisis, but what's subtle is relative to what America could be in the next several years in terms of making more substantial investments in infrastructure, science research, and public investments that we have historically made." Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said on Hugh Hewitt's radio program last week that it was important for the administration to change how Washington thinks. "We don't solve problems by simply throwing money at them," he said.

After 10 weeks of pinballing through political and domestic fiascos largely of his own making, President Trump last week faced the kinds of wrenching external challenges no White House occupant can avoid for long. “No child of God should ever suffer such horror,” Trump said emotionally Thursday night after he ordered a cruise missile attack on a Syrian airfield in response to a poison gas bomb that killed dozens of civilians, including children, and left dozens more writhing in pain. This was the week a reality-TV presidency faced cold reality. The fast-moving Syrian crisis combined with escalating U.S. concerns about North Korea’s ballistic missile tests and nuclear capability, even as Trump held back-to-back summits with three visiting foreign leaders, including China's president. Those urgent demands consumed much of Trump’s attention while other White House problems continued to simmer. A new push to repeal and replace Obamacare was on life support in Congress, the scandal over Russian meddling in the election claimed another GOP scalp, and his White House again descended into a cacophony of West Wing intrigue and infighting. But Trump notched a historic win — arguably his first since the election — with the Senate confirmation of conservative jurist Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, ensuring that whatever else happens, a Trump legacy is now ensured. Trump vowed in his scorched-earth campaign last year to “drain the swamp” of the forces that run Washington. But in his most consequential week in office so far, Trump relied on familiar pillars of the establishment: the generals who now run his national security team, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose political cunning engineered the Gorsuch confirmation. What was billed as a showdown between the leaders of the United States and China over trade and North Korea ended with little sign of confrontation Friday — or of concrete progress in resolving their differences. President Donald Trump had predicted a "very difficult" meeting with Chinese President... What was billed as a showdown between the leaders of the United States and China over trade and North Korea ended with little sign of confrontation Friday — or of concrete progress in resolving their differences. President Donald Trump had predicted a "very difficult" meeting with Chinese President... McConnell, the ultimate of inside players, downplayed his own role in Trump’s first major success in Congress. “We're just in the first quarter of the year,” he said. “There's much left to be done.” And while Trump ran on anti-globalist threats aimed at China, he relied on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp., one of the world’s largest energy conglomerates — to take a key role at his overnight summit in Florida with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump has long boasted of his fierce negotiating skills and how they would help him as president. While no mishaps marred his talks with Xi, he also made no apparent breakthroughs on trade or North Korea, the White House priorities. “So far I have gotten nothing,” Trump joked to reporters at one point. “Absolutely nothing.” The evolution of Trump’s national security team underscores the rapid change in the spheres of influence that surround Trump. “A year ago if you asked me who are the three most important people in national security, I would have said they’re Mike Flynn, Jeff Sessions and Rudy Giuliani,” said Jim Carafano, a Heritage Foundation analyst who advised the Trump campaign and transition teams. Flynn was ousted as national security advisor in February for misleading the White House about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Sessions, the attorney general, had to recuse himself from the Justice Department inquiry into Russian meddling for failing to acknowledge his meetings with the same ambassador. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, fell out of favor and was not chosen for a top job. “So the core of his national security [team] has shifted completely to three people he didn’t even know a year ago,” Carafano said, referring to Tillerson, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary James N. Mattis. Adding to the upheaval, the White House last week removed Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and fellow disrupter, from membership in the National Security Council, and reinserted the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Whether Bannon was demoted is disputed but there’s no doubt about the impact: An unconventional White House was reverting to a more familiar hierarchy and norm, at least for matters of war and peace. That much was clear in Trump's decision to launch 60 cruise missiles at an airfield in Syria, the first deliberate U.S. attack on a Syrian facility, in response to the chemical weapons attack on April 4. The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawks hit their intended targets and one fell in the Mediterranean. President Trump made an about-face in his approach to the Middle East by launching a fiery salvo of cruise missiles early Friday, and with it came relief to American allies — and many of the president’s critics at home — but its impact in Syria will ultimately depend on what Trump does next. Attacking... President Trump made an about-face in his approach to the Middle East by launching a fiery salvo of cruise missiles early Friday, and with it came relief to American allies — and many of the president’s critics at home — but its impact in Syria will ultimately depend on what Trump does next. Attacking... Trump had just finished huddling with McMaster and other key aides aboard Air Force One when he walked back to talk to reporters. The salvo of missiles would fly that night, in the most significant military action of his young presidency, and he seemed alternately at ease, defensive and boastful. Trump acknowledged his staff had been “shaken up,” a rare nod to the White House turmoil. Then he turned to his characteristic hyperbole. “We’ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of presidents,” he said, although it’s only been 11 weeks and historians might challenge that assessment given that he’s gotten no legislation through Congress and federal courts have blocked several major executive orders. He cited achievements — some symbolic or initiated before his election — in bringing jobs and renegotiating military contracts. “We’ve had a tremendous success,” he said. “And we’ve just begun. And we’re going to have a very interesting couple of days.” Yet the suffering in Syria had clearly left him shaken. “I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity,” he said, without tipping his hand to the attack he had ordered. During the campaign, Trump railed at the Obama and Bush administrations for their foreign interventions and nation-building efforts. He, in contrast, saw the world through the isolationist lens of “America First,” keeping the military in reserve only for emergencies. But it was never clear if his ideology was fixed or evolving. The answer came at a Rose Garden news conference Wednesday when Trump suddenly touted his flexibility on foreign affairs. “I do change and I am flexible, and I’m proud of that flexibility,” he said. “And I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me.” The abrupt shift doesn't surprise those who have studied the White House. “Presidents come into office and the reality of the Oval Office hits and they make decisions based on being the president of the United States, not a candidate for the presidency of the United States,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a Marine reservist who served under McMaster. “It happens to every single president.” The airstrikes in Syria may complicate national security challenges with Russia, Iran and the Middle East. But skeptics, even within Trump’s party, say they feel more confident in his ability to address foreign policy crises after last week. As a private citizen, Donald Trump eschewed any sort of intervention in Syria. “We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA,” he boomed on Twitter in September 2013. That “America first” philosophy energized... As a private citizen, Donald Trump eschewed any sort of intervention in Syria. “We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA,” he boomed on Twitter in September 2013. That “America first” philosophy energized... “I've always said that he had a very strong team around him, but I've also said, during this period of time, will the president listen to them?” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told MSNBC. “I think that question was answered [Thursday] night.” Still, three weeks from his first 100 days in office, Trump faces other major hurdles. Congress must vote on a spending package by month's end to keep the government running, a vote that is not assured. As lawmakers head out on a two-week recess, many expect to face constituents angry that the GOP-led Congress failed to deliver a new healthcare bill. And congressional and FBI investigations into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and potential connections to Trump’s campaign team won’t be dismissed easily. The murky case claimed a new victim last week when the head of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), recused himself from a Russia probe because he was under a House ethics investigation for allegedly disclosing classified information that the White House had given him. Trump’s supporters and foes alike know a new self-inflicted controversy is only a tweet away. “I would love to see the tweeting stop, but I would also like to see pigs fly,” McCain said. “I just think it's in his DNA. But perhaps there could be more restraint. I would hope that would happen. He now has an opportunity to reboot with the American people.” michael.memoli@latimes.com noah.bierman@latimes.com For more White House coverage, follow @mikememoli and @noahbierman on Twitter.

U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are not happy about reports that former President Barack Obama will be paid $400,000 to speak at a September health care conference put on by the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Warren said Thursday on SiriusXM's "Alter Family Politics" program that she is concerned about the overall influence of money in politics. Sanders, a fierce Wall Street critic, told "CBS This Morning" he finds it unfortunate that Obama took on the engagement at a time when "people are frustrated with the power of Wall Street and big-money interests." During a moment alone with Hillary Clinton before an October campaign event in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren recalls, the presidential nominee seemed confident: She "smiled and said the numbers looked good." But Warren didn't share the candidate's optimism. "I was anxious, right down to my bones,"... During a moment alone with Hillary Clinton before an October campaign event in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren recalls, the presidential nominee seemed confident: She "smiled and said the numbers looked good." But Warren didn't share the candidate's optimism. "I was anxious, right down to my bones,"... Sanders' distrust of politicians receiving what he considers exorbitant paychecks for speaking to major investment banks is well known. He relentlessly criticized former rival Hillary Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs when they were vying for the Democratic Party's nomination last year. Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that the Democratic former president accepted the invitation to speak because health care is "an issue of great importance to him." He added that Obama implemented financial reforms even after taking money from Wall Street as a candidate in 2008. Obama will be true to his values and record "regardless of venue or sponsor" for his speeches, Schultz said.

White House officials and several Republican lawmakers claimed Tuesday they were nearing a deal on health-care legislation with the House Freedom Caucus, with at least three leading figures in the hard-line group ready to support an overhaul after the dramatic collapse of talks last month. Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, - all leaders of the Freedom Caucus and central figures in the latest discussions - signaled Tuesday they are ready to support a new plan, according to two White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. A lawmaker close to the Freedom Caucus later confirmed that those members were close to or ready to support the tweaked bill. Top members of the House Freedom Caucus would say little on Tuesday night about where they stand on the revised measure. Meadows said that he won't weigh in publicly until after the Freedom Caucus meets Wednesday night, but he praised Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., - co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group - and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., for their role in trying to reach consensus. "I'm obviously very supportive of Tom MacArthur and his efforts and Chairman Walden and his efforts," Meadows said. "So I can tell you the efforts they have put forth are to be applauded." "I may have," is all Labrador would say when asked whether he has decided to support a revised health-care package. "I have not made a public announcement." "We've got a meeting tomorrow night!" said Jordan, who refused to elaborate. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., another Freedom Caucus member, stopped short of vouching support for the bill, but said "it seems to me it is going in a very good direction." He said he needs to see the legislative text before making a final decision. "I would not be the most shocked person in the building if we voted it this week out of the House," Franks said. Planning your family's future? According to a report from the Health Cost Institute, per-capita spending on children's health care has increased more than 5 percent annually since 2010, due to rising health costs. And the states are not created equal. You may want to consider relocating to any of these states, per WalletHub, to get the most bang for your buck when it comes to quality and access to care for the next generation. A top aide to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he "hasn't ruled out" a vote on a health-care bill this week, but that his top priority is passing a spending measure to keep the government funded. If consensus on health care were reached, however, the House could move quickly, said spokeswoman AshLee Strong. "I think we can turn things around quickly if we were to reach an agreement," she said. "We will see something as soon as we can, but we're not there right now." Top GOP aides said that text of the new bill probably won't be posted until House Republicans feel confident that they have enough votes to pass the bill. Rep. David Brat, R-Va., a Freedom Caucus member who previously opposed the GOP health-care plan, said he is "looking forward" to supporting it with the new changes giving states more options. "A lot of people like it," Brat told reporters Tuesday night. The agreement at the crux of the revised bill would allow states to opt out of some insurance regulations in the Affordable Care Act. Through a federal waiver, insurers could be freed from a requirement to cover certain essential health benefits as defined by the federal government. And while they would still be required to cover people with preexisting conditions, they could charge those patients higher premiums. Congressional negotiators on Tuesday inched toward a potential agreement on a catchall spending bill that would deny President Donald Trump's request for immediate funding to construct a wall along the Mexico border. The emerging measure would increase the defense budget and eliminate the threat... Congressional negotiators on Tuesday inched toward a potential agreement on a catchall spending bill that would deny President Donald Trump's request for immediate funding to construct a wall along the Mexico border. The emerging measure would increase the defense budget and eliminate the threat... The language was crafted jointly in recent days by MacArthur and Meadows, who heads the Freedom Caucus, with White House officials involved in those conversations, officials said. White House officials said Tuesday that MacArthur made clear during the discussions that he wanted states such as New Jersey to be able to keep some mandates under the law, while Meadows wanted states to have the choice of opting out of the insurance requirements. Any new proposal would have to surmount the same obstacles that stalled the House GOP leadership's plan before Congress left for a two-week recess in early April. "The key to getting this across the finish line doesn't rest with the Tuesday Group. It rests with the Freedom Caucus," Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a member of the centrist group, said Tuesday. The president has been fitfully trying to restart health-care talks after Ryan abruptly pulled the American Health Care Act from the floor at the end of March. Trump at first said the health-care issue was dead but then revived talks. Trump seems intent on getting a concrete legislative win, or at least flashes of progress in that direction, as his administration approaches the 100-day mark. Republicans close to House GOP leaders said Tuesday they remain skeptical of how much support would be behind any new legislation, and said House leaders are not driving the discussions with the Freedom Caucus. Other Freedom Caucus members, such as Brat, told reporters Tuesday evening that they are likely to support the compromise, while others declined to comment, saying they have not yet seen the proposal. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a deficit hawk and Freedom Caucus member who opposed the AHCA, said he would review the amendment. "Essential benefits and all the other mandates may be affordable in a wealthy state, but unaffordable in a poorer state like Mississippi or Alabama that causes people to go from some insurance to no health insurance," Brooks said. The carrot for conservatives is the opportunity for states to apply for waivers from some of the ACA's mandates, including its requirement for insurers to cover essential health benefits and its ban on swelling premiums for people with preexisting health conditions. Many conservatives don't like leaving the law's insurance regulations in place, but the waiver provision allows them to argue that they're giving states more control over the situation. But the revisions would also restore the law's federal essential health benefits requirements for states that don't obtain a waiver from them. The original bill would have turned over those regulations completely to the states. The Washington Post's Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report.

The final frenzy at the White House began Monday, with a private reception for conservative news publications, a tariff on softwood lumber imports from Canada and the late-night debut of a website highlighting President Donald Trump's "First 100 Days" achievements. It continued Tuesday in the form of an executive order designed to help farmers and ranchers, an assurance that construction will begin soon on a wall along the nation's southern border - "The wall's going to get built," the president said - and media briefings by senior administration officials who gave their takes on Trump's successes. And by Wednesday, the White House plans to unveil its tax plan, which would cut the corporate tax rate drastically, to 15 percent. Trump has called Saturday's 100-day marker - a remnant of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial flurry of legislative action - an "artificial" construct, and he is not incorrect. Yet the kinetic energy emanating from the West Wing, which at times borders on frenetic, reveals a White House eager to cross the threshold with some tangible wins. The whirlwind of activity this week seems aimed at demonstrating forward momentum from a young administration criticized for a lack of signature legislative achievements - a sense that doing something, anything, is better than the perception of stagnation. As the president himself quipped Tuesday afternoon, preparing to sign his latest executive order: "It's a lot of words. I won't bother reading everything." Trump is under considerable pressure, some of it self-imposed, to deliver. From funding construction of the border wall to spurring $1 trillion in infrastructure investments over the next decade, the president has implemented zero of the 10 biggest promises he outlined as a presidential candidate for his first 100 days in a contract with American voters. None of those promises have become law. Only one bill has been introduced in Congress - an ill-fated measure to scale back President Barack Obama's health-care law that culminated in an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Trump's own party. White House officials and several Republican lawmakers said Tuesday that they were nearing a deal to try again, though details were sparse. In many ways, Trump, more than any modern president before him, runs his White House like a television drama, believing that sometimes projecting an image of energy and progress is as important, if not more so, than the reality. The White House debuted a website highlighting what it calls President Donald Trump achievements in his first 100 days. The White House debuted a website highlighting what it calls President Donald Trump achievements in his first 100 days. But Peter Wehner, a former official in the George W. Bush White House who is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said no administration can bluff its way through four years. "You have to produce," Wehner said. "Ultimately the achievements will matter. You can spin and you can sell and you can put things in bright neon lights, but when everything is said and done, presidents are judged on their results." The Trump White House has produced some accomplishments already, from regulatory rollbacks intended to promote economic growth to the successful installation of Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. "We see a president that's working at breakneck speed and somebody who's going as fast as he can in the confines of the law, running through that punch list of promises he made during the campaign," Reince Priebus, Trump's chief of staff, said Tuesday. But on his largest promises - those boomed from campaign trail stages and enshrined in his voter contract - Trump has fallen short, a gap in signature legislative triumphs that has sent the president and his aides scrambling to notch victories, some of them more tenuous and less substantial than others. An Associated Press analysis found that Trump has accomplished just 10 of the 38 specific promises he detailed in his voter contract, most of those through executive orders that allowed him to bypass the Republican-controlled Congress. Asked about Trump's failure to implement many of the key items in the contract, which he unveiled in October, Marc Short, the White House director for legislative affairs, said the administration had, in some ways, run up against the inherently slow-moving federal bureaucracy. "There are certain promises that you need to work with House and Senate leadership on, and it's a process," Short said in a morning meeting with reporters. "I think on the House side, obviously, the health-care legislation took longer than we would have wanted, but we're excited as to where that stands today, and we think we'll get that completed." Short said the administration was not backing down on its commitment to its early promises but added, "Perhaps the timetable was ambitious." Still, in the run-up to the 100-day mark, the administration has become a whirling dervish of activity. In a memo Tuesday that contained a number of factual inaccuracies - including a claim that Roosevelt signed only nine executive orders, rather than the actual 99, in his first 100 days - the White House boasted of the president's "historic accomplishment," citing the 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions, the 28 laws, and the 30 executive orders that Trump has implemented or passed. The president's team has also deployed Cabinet secretaries throughout the country to tout what they say are Trump's robust successes. And Saturday, the president will headline a 100-day political rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Sure enough, the big trans-Pacific trade deal is toast, climate change action is on the ropes and various regulations from the Obama era have been scrapped. It's also a safe bet President Donald Trump hasn't raced a bicycle since Jan. 20, keeping that vow. Add a Supreme Court justice — no small... Sure enough, the big trans-Pacific trade deal is toast, climate change action is on the ropes and various regulations from the Obama era have been scrapped. It's also a safe bet President Donald Trump hasn't raced a bicycle since Jan. 20, keeping that vow. Add a Supreme Court justice — no small... But even as Trump sought to project strength, a federal judge in San Francisco delivered a new setback Tuesday, blocking the administration's plans to withhold federal funding from "sanctuary cities," those that refuse to detain undocumented immigrants for deportation. On Capitol Hill, Republicans largely defended the president, with some seeking to separate his domestic achievements from his foreign policy moves as they reflected on what Trump has and has not achieved so far. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had dinner with Trump on Monday night, said he was pleased with Trump's national security team and praised the cruise missile strikes the president launched in Syria. But he sized up Trump's domestic agenda differently. "Obviously, it's been stalled," McCain said. However, McCain partially blamed members of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus for thwarting the effort to overhaul Obama's Affordable Care Act last month, echoing a criticism Short had offered more gently earlier in the day. "We've learned that the House Republican Party, to its credit, is enormously diverse in its opinions, but that also sometimes creates larger challenges in bringing them together on a big legislative issue," Short said, reflecting on lessons his legislative-affairs team had learned in the failed health-care effort. Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a Trump ally, faulted Congress for the president's lack of domestic accomplishments. "Congress has to pass bills for him to sign them into law," Collins said. "If there is a frustration, it's really aimed at Congress, not the president." For congressional Democrats, who have waged a full-fledged war against much of the president's agenda, there is some relief that he has not delivered on many of his promises, most notably his vow on the ACA, also known as Obamacare. But Democrats are also trying to blame Trump for what he hasn't accomplished. They argue that while he campaigned on a populist platform, vowing to help average Americans, he has instead spearheaded efforts that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the working class. In some ways, Trump's blustery two-step leading up to Saturday is simply the repackaging of a strategy he learned as a real estate developer - a technique he described in "The Art of the Deal" as "truthful hyperbole." In the 1987 book, he chronicled creating an aura of success before he'd actually achieved it - such as when he ordered his Atlantic City construction crews to dig up dirt on one side of a site to simply deposit it back on the other, in order to present a sense of progress. But Warren Tompkins, a longtime Republican strategist based in South Carolina, said that at some point, voters will demand evidence of signature legislation. "Our problem is people voted to give us the keys to the bus, and we've forgotten how to drive," Tompkins said. Amid Trump's struggles, even the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library felt emboldened this week. On Monday, the library posted a tweet noting the laws and executive orders President Carter had signed in his first 100 days, before ending with the most devastating statistic of all - Carter's approval rating of 63 percent. Trump, the least-popular new president in modern times, has an average approval rating currently hovering in the low 40s.

Sure enough, the big trans-Pacific trade deal is toast, climate change action is on the ropes and various regulations from the Obama era have been scrapped. It's also a safe bet President Donald Trump hasn't raced a bicycle since Jan. 20, keeping that vow. Add a Supreme Court justice — no small feat — and call these promises kept. But where's that wall? Or the promised trade punishment against China — will the Chinese get off scot-free from "the greatest theft in the history of the world"? What about that "easy" replacement for Obamacare? How about the trillion-dollar infrastructure plan and huge tax cut that were supposed to be in motion by now? Trump's road to the White House, paved in big, sometimes impossible pledges, has detoured onto a byway of promises deferred or left behind, an AP analysis found. Of 38 specific promises Trump made in his 100-day "contract" with voters — "This is my pledge to you" — he's accomplished 10, mostly through executive orders that don't require legislation, such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He's abandoned several and failed to deliver quickly on others, stymied at times by a divided Republican Party and resistant federal judges. Of 10 promises that require Congress to act, none has been achieved and most have not been introduced.

New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg urged world leaders not to follow President Donald Trump's lead on climate change and declared his intention to help save an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions. Bloomberg, who considered a presidential bid after serving three terms as New York... "I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days," the president bragged in a recent interview with AP, even as he criticized the marker as an "artificial barrier." In truth, his 100-day plan remains mostly a to-do list that will spill over well beyond Saturday, his 100th day. Some of Trump's promises were obviously hyperbole to begin with. Don't hold your breath waiting for alleged Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl to be dropped out of an airplane without a parachute, as Trump vowed he'd do at many of his campaign rallies. China's leader got a fancy dinner, complete with "beautiful" chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago this month, not the promised "McDonald's hamburger" and humble pie. But many promises were meant to be taken seriously. Trump clearly owes his supporters a Mexico border wall, even if it doesn't end up being a foot taller than the Great Wall of China. One page of his 100-day manifesto is devoted to legislation he would fight to pass in 100 days. None of it has been achieved. Trump wants funding... Trump wants funding... The other page lists 18 executive actions and intentions he promised to pursue — many on Day One. He has followed through on fewer than a dozen, largely through the use of executive orders, and the White House is boasting that he will set a post-World War II record when he signs more this week. That's a change in tune. "We need people in Washington that don't go around signing executive orders because they can't get people into a room and get some kind of a deal that's negotiated," he declared in New Hampshire in March 2015. "We need people that know how to lead, and we don't have that. We have amateurs." Efforts to provide affordable child care and paid maternity leave, to make college more affordable and to invest in urban areas have been all but forgotten. That's despite the advantage of a Republican-controlled Congress, which the White House failed to pull together behind Trump's first attempt to repeal and replace "Obamacare." An AP reporter who followed Trump throughout the presidential campaign collected scores of promises he made along the way, from the consequential to the fanciful. Here are some of them, and his progress so far: ___ ENERGY and the ENVIRONMENT: — Lift President Barack Obama's roadblocks on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Done. Keystone XL is revived and construction of the Dakota Access is completed. — Lift restrictions on mining coal and drilling for oil and natural gas. Done. Trump has unraveled a number of Obama-era restrictions and initiated a review of the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to restrict greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants. — Cancel payments to U.N. climate change programs and pull out of the Paris climate accord Nope. Trump has yet to make a decision on Paris. His aides are torn. ___ ECONOMY and TRADE: — Pass a tax overhaul. "Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration," he told his supporters again and again in the final weeks of the campaign. "We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan." He promised a plan that would reduce rates dramatically both for corporations and the middle class. Nowhere close. Trump has scrapped the tax plan he campaigned on, and his administration's new package is in its early stages, not only missing the first 100 days but likely to miss a new August deadline set by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Some details may emerge this week. —Designate China a currency manipulator, setting the stage for possible trade penalties because "we're like the piggy bank that's being robbed. We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing." Abandoned. Trump says he doesn't want to punish China when it is cooperating in a response to North Korean provocations. He also says China has stopped manipulating its currency for unfair trade advantage. But China was moving away from that behavior well before he took office. Also set aside: repeated vows to slap high tariffs on Chinese imports. —Announce his intention to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Backtracked, in essence. A draft of his administration's plan for NAFTA proposes only a mild rewrite. But in his AP interview, he threatened anew to terminate the deal if his goals are not met in a renegotiation. — Direct his commerce secretary and trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly hurt American workers. Done. Trump has initiated plenty of studies over the past 100 days. — Slap a 35 percent tariff on goods from companies that ship production abroad. Force companies like Apple and Nabisco to make their products in the U.S. Nope. —Embark on a massive $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country's infrastructure, including airports, roads and bridges. Not yet. __ SECURITY, DEFENSE and IMMIGRATION: — Immediately suspend the Syrian refugee program. Trump tried, but the first version of his travel ban was blocked by the courts. A revised version dropped references to Syrian refugees entirely. That was blocked, too. And he has yet to mention another campaign pledge: to deport Syrian refugees already settled in the U.S. — Inform his generals they have 30 days to submit a new plan for defeating the Islamic State group. Trump did indeed order up a plan. It's unclear what it is since it has yet to be made public. — Suspend immigration from "terror-prone regions" where he says vetting is too difficult. Trump's effort to bar immigration temporarily from some Muslim-majority countries has been stymied by courts. — Implement "extreme" immigration vetting techniques. In progress. The Homeland Security Department is considering a number of measures, like asking for visitors' phone contacts and social media passwords. —Build an "impenetrable physical wall" along the length of the southern border, and make Mexico pay for it. The government has been soliciting bids and test sections could be built as soon as this summer. Mexico is not paying for this work. —End federal funding to "sanctuary cities" — places where local officials are considered by Washington to be insufficiently cooperative in arresting or detaining people in the country illegally. The Justice Department has threatened to do so, but there are legal limits. — Immediately deport the estimated 2 million "criminal aliens" living in the country, including gang members, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. Deportations have not increased. Arrests of people in the U.S. illegally are up and illegal border crossings are significantly down. —Cancel visas for foreign countries that won't take back criminals deported by the U.S. There's been no discussion of this yet. —"Immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties," one of which allows young people brought into the country as children to stay and work. Trump has made no effort to end the program, even though it would take a single phone call. In fact, he told AP these young people can "rest easy" and not fear deportation. ___ GOVERNMENT and the SWAMP: — Ask agency and department heads to identify job-killing regulations for elimination. Done. — Propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. Nope. — "Drain the swamp." On his pledge to curb the power of special interests, Trump has so far used an executive order to prohibit political appointees from lobbying the government for five years after serving in his administration and to ban outgoing officials from representing foreign governments. But he's discontinuing the Obama-era practice of releasing White House visitor logs, restoring a shroud over what special interests are getting in his gates. He's also issued at least one waiver to his lobbying ban, allowing a White House budget adviser to go advocate for a business trade group — Impose a hiring freeze on federal employees, excluding military and public safety staffers. This was one of Trump's first actions. But the freeze has since been lifted. —Require that two regulations be eliminated for each new one imposed. Trump signed an order requiring agencies to identify two existing regulations for every new one imposed — though there is nothing in the order that requires the two to be eliminated. ___ FOREIGN AFFAIRS: — End the strategy of nation-building and regime change. Trump's foreign policy posture is still in its early stages, though he has already intervened in Syria and has escalated rhetoric against North Korea. — Move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The administration says it is studying the issue. — Negotiate the release of all U.S. prisoners held in Iran, even before taking office. Renegotiate or leave the Iran nuclear deal. No prisoners have been released. The administration is studying the nuclear deal and Trump told AP "it's possible" the U.S. will withdraw. — Create a safe zone in Syria for refugees, paid for by the Gulf states. Not yet. ___ HEALTH CARE, COURTS and GUNS: —"My first day in office, I'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability. You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost. It's going to be so easy." The bill to replace "Obamacare" was pulled from Congress because it lacked enough support. He will try again with a revised plan. — Begin selecting a new Supreme Court judge to fill the court's vacancy. Done. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch and the Senate approved him. — Eliminate gun-free zones in schools and on military bases. Nope. ___ REALLY? — "I promise I will never be in a bicycle race." So far, so good. Trump's vow came after John Kerry, then secretary of state, broke his femur in May 2015 while riding a bicycle. He was not in a bicycle race. —Bar his generals from being interviewed on television. Never mind that. Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, as Trump's national security adviser, recently appeared on a Sunday news show. Several senior military officers have done Pentagon news conferences in the past few months that are taped by the networks. Gen. John Nicholson, the top general in Afghanistan, appeared at a news conference Monday. —No time for play. Most weekends as president, Trump has broken his pledge to avoid the golf course, after years of criticizing his predecessor for playing the game. "Because I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf," he told a Virginia rally in August. "Believe me." —Season's greetings. "If I become president, we're gonna be saying Merry Christmas at every store. ... You can leave 'happy holidays' at the corner." As president-elect over the holidays, he sent a "Merry Christmas" tweet. So did President Obama. And both sent Happy Hanukkah wishes. Associated Press writers Alicia A. Caldwell, Lolita C. Baldor and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

She knew to hold her tongue during a business trip to Chicago the night Donald Trump was elected, and endured a long evening of schmoozing with the other sales reps and executives. Back in her hotel room the next morning, Lisa drew a hot bath and sobbed. Then her sadness turned to an anger that startled even her. The 55-year-old mom, never particularly active in politics, went outside, looked up at the nearby Trump Tower office building and flipped the icon of the new president the double bird. From that point, there was no turning back. Within days she had organized a Trump resistance group, donned a pink pussyhat and drove 14 hours with a carload of like-minded crusaders to the Women’s March in Washington. “We’re all terrified at what’s going on — that our country is going to be somehow ruined,” said Lisa, who kick-started early retirement to focus almost full time on civic activism. Even so, she’s reluctant to allow her full name to be used, worried about how her efforts could affect her life and her family. President Trump’s election has mobilized thousands of first-time activists in a do-it-yourself movement like nothing seen on the political left in years. With bountiful energy and some impressive early successes, the grass-roots movement has stunned even Democratic Party officials, drawing comparisons to the tea party movement that transformed the GOP with its unyielding opposition after President Obama’s election. Women nationwide — and much of the movement is being fueled by women — are organizing via Facebook, email and often tearful support meetings around kitchen tables. The Indivisible Project, launched after Trump’s election, has already sprouted nearly 6,000 chapters nationwide, at least two in each of the 435 congressional districts. More established activist groups like MoveOn.org — which holds weekly “Resist Trump Tuesdays” protests — are enjoying a surge in membership, particularly in blue states, but most surprisingly in some deep-red pockets, where liberals had largely kept quieter. One Colorado activist said that in past years, event turnout rarely matched the number of advance sign-ups; now it routinely surpasses it. These newly minted activists — along with other long-standing protest groups on the left — flooded the U.S. Capitol switchboard during Senate confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet, pushed Democrats to filibuster Neil M. Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination and helped tank the president’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — often by noisily protesting at lawmakers’ town hall meetings. With old-school organizing and modern-day social media they have formed instant communities that can mobilize hundreds — even thousands — as a group of stay-at-home moms in Kenosha, Wis., did recently to protest Trump’s visit there. “We always told our kids there’s a lot of really smart people in our country, and we all want to make it better,” said Julia Kozel, one of the women who organized the Kenosha rally. “But I don’t feel like I could say that anymore.” Like the tea party activists before them, many of the resisters — as they call themselves — are newcomers to the political process. And much in the same way tea party activists grieved for the country they no longer recognized under Obama, these women recount being devastated that fellow Americans elected Trump and say they are fighting to restore their own vision of the country. Publicly, Democratic officials embrace the newfound energy on the left. Party strategists even marvel at the large turnouts that they had been unable to achieve in recent years. But privately, many Democrats also worry the movement is whipping up a deep-rooted emotional and ideological fervor, much like the tea party did in blocking Obama’s agenda. Unpredictable and with no clear leadership, the liberal uprising could prove difficult to contain and may turn its anger — currently focused on Trump — toward the Democratic Party itself, just as the tea party fractured the GOP. Wounds from the 2016 primary battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont still run deep among Democrats, and the protest movement could split the party further between moderates and progressives. Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a favorite among progressives, found herself under fire after voting to confirm Housing Secretary Ben Carson. Some progressives threatened to challenge the Massachusetts liberal in the next primary. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein felt pressured enough to hold her first town hall in years early this month. There she was heckled as a “sellout” from an occasionally rowdy crowd of liberals. When airport protests erupted over Trump’s first travel ban, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) raced to Dulles International Airport to demonstrate his solidarity. “No party is safe,” said Jeanne Peters, a jewelry designer in West Virginia, whose Indivisible chapter has started calling its House member and both its Republican and Democratic senator every weekday with a coordinated message, such as demanding a congressional vote on Syrian airstrikes or opposing the GOP healthcare plan. If the threat from the left wasn’t evident enough, a new political action committee, #WeWillRreplaceYou, is raising money to back primary campaigns against Democrats they view as insufficiently progressive — much the way outside conservative groups targeted “RINOs,” politicians they considered Republicans in Name Only. Voters who are “fed up with the Democratic Party at every level want to see their Democratic representatives stand up and fight Trump,” said Claire Sandberg, a former Sanders organizer who is a cofounder of the PAC. Another group run by former Sanders allies, Brand New Congress, is recruiting challengers for every single House district — Democrats and Republicans alike — in 2018. Rep. Ted Lieu, a progressive from California known even in Oshkosh for his pointed tweets about the president, acknowledged the risk for Democrats as passions run like nothing he has ever seen. “People call my office all the time, and they want President Trump impeached two months ago,” he said. “We just have to tamp down expectations.” The groups make it no secret that they are using the tea party playbook to fight Trump. “The tea party had a method of organizing that works,” said Hillary Shields, 32, a paralegal whose Indivisible group drew nearly 150 to a Saturday spring training for activists in Kansas City, Mo. “Why reinvent the wheel?” Ezra Levin, a former Capitol Hill staffer who is president of the Indivisible Project, helped fuel the movement by posting online a how-to organizing guide that borrows heavily from the tea party. “The goal of this tactic isn’t just to target Republicans. It’s to stiffen the spines of Democrats,” he said. But while the resistance groups share many similarities with the tea party, it remains to be seen how far they are willing to go to block Trump’s agenda. Would they be willing to shut down the government, as the tea party did over Obamacare, for their own priorities — say, to save Planned Parenthood or stop Trump’s travel ban? The moms sitting around the dining room table at Kozel’s house the day after the Kenosha protest shake their heads no, saying they wouldn’t want to disrupt government operations or break laws with civil disobedience. “Our endgame is getting people elected,” said Kozel, as three of her school-age kids munched doughnuts and played nearby. But others know playing nicely may only go so far. Many women said that the Democratic Party needs to be more progressive — and they are trying to push the party in that direction. Among the new activists is Lisa E. Hansen, 51, a former graphic artist who had never been politically active much beyond casting her vote. “And then the election happened,” said Hansen, after she and others wrote postcards to lawmakers at her Oshkosh home. She said she sunk into a depression, spending her days scouring the news to make sense of it all. Only when protesters turned out for the Women’s March did she think to herself: “I can do that.” Now every Tuesday, Hansen, who is partly disabled by Lyme disease, puts her walker in the trunk of her family’s car and heads to downtown Oshkosh to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s office, where a few dozen resisters have been protesting every week since the inauguration. She dials up the senator’s office on Mondays to say that her group is coming and would like a meeting. The senator has not agreed to meet with them. But his staff comes out to hear their concerns, and sometimes Hansen brings them snacks. On a recent Tuesday, more than two dozen protesters quietly formed a neat line outside the office with homemade signs reading, “Not paying for Trump’s wall!” and “Don’t let Wisconsin values be Trump’d.” The Tuesday protests were supposed to last only for the first 100 days of the new administration. But as that date approaches, no one wants to quit, so they agreed to extend it for another 100 days. “It’s given me a sense of purpose,” Hansen said. “Maybe we should send Donald Trump a thank-you note. He brought all of us together.”

President Donald Trump and White House officials pressed congressional Republicans on Sunday to use the looming threat of a government shutdown to win funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top priority for the administration as it nears the symbolic 100-day mark. Trump wants funding to be included in a spending measure that would keep the government open past April 28, a determined effort that has prompted a possible standoff with lawmakers in both parties, who hope to avert a federal closure next weekend. Trump's push for fast action on his pledge to build the border wall is part of a mounting and, at times, tense scramble inside the administration to kick-start the president's agenda, even if it risks dire political consequences. It follows weeks of frustration within the White House over inaction and stalemates on Capitol Hill over big-ticket items such as health care and tax cuts. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post that the president and his advisers remain "strong" in their commitment to securing funding for border security and a wall. "This is what the president ran on," Priebus said. "We want to get to a place this week where border-security money is being directed to the Department of Homeland Security so that we can begin surveillance and preliminary work, and then we will keep working on getting DHS what it needs for the structure." The timing promises a week of high drama on the Hill. The Senate returns Monday night, and the House returns Tuesday from a two-week recess, leaving just three days when both chambers will be in session to wrangle out a funding agreement. Negotiators worked throughout the break, but thus far a deal has not been struck. The wall, which experts say would cost $21.6 billion and take three and a half years to construct, has emerged as a crucial sticking point for the White House, with the president insisting privately and publicly that progress toward its funding and eventual construction must be showcased this week. "Congress is right to be nervous, but that's Trump's style to be aggressive, ambitious, right out of 'The Art of the Deal,'" said William Bennett, a conservative commentator and close friend of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. "Everyone seems to be getting used to that and how Trump doesn't want the half loaf but the whole loaf." In a tweet Sunday, Trump elbowed Democrats who have resisted his call to include wall funding. He chastised them for not wanting "money from the budget going to the border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs" and gang activity, in his view. Trump added that he would continue to ask Mexico to pay for the project, another bold proclamation he made during the campaign. Meanwhile, he said, he will press Congress for funding "so we can get started early" on the "badly needed border wall." It remained unclear Sunday whether moderates within the GOP could convince the White House to avoid a shutdown. Democrats have insisted that they will not vote for any spending bill that gives the White House money or flexibility to begin construction of a border barrier. They believe that the GOP will have to either abandon Trump's demand or assume political responsibility if a shutdown occurs. "The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Building a wall is not an answer. Not here or any place." Inside the White House on Sunday, West Wing aides made calls to congressional allies, while the president tweeted and reached out to several advisers, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump's tweets included a shot at Democrats in which he drew parallels between border-wall funding and continued federal payments for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Some Trump associates said that they believe Democrats may be willing to deal on border funding if those payments are put on the table this week during cross-party talks. "ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going — otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought," Trump tweeted. He later followed: "The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members." The tweets did little to assuage concerns created earlier in the day when White House budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested that Trump might not sign a spending bill that does not meet his demands. "Will he sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall?" Chris Wallace, host of "Fox News Sunday," asked Mulvaney during a televised interview. "We don't know yet," Mulvaney responded. Mulvaney said the White House expects Democrats to cave on the border wall in exchange for guaranteed payments under the ACA. But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., have already rejected a White House offer to build into the spending bill a dollar-for-dollar match in wall funding and federal health-care payments. Negotiators want the stopgap measure to keep government open by keeping spending flat, including money to keep the ACA going. Trump is hoping to open that up for negotiation in exchange for wall money. Democrats believe that voters will blame Trump for a shutdown, particularly if congressional leaders omit wall funding from a spending deal. Democrats and GOP leaders appeared to be nearing a spending agreement last week before Trump ramped up his demands. Aides hailed the budget talks as one of the only active discussions in which Democrats and Republicans maintained common ground. One clear area of agreement was not to include border funding in the stopgap budget. Democrats agreed to include other border-security measures, including money for new drones to patrol the border, but it was agreed that the wall itself should be debated separately, after the government is kept open. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among a group of prominent Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they hope to avoid a border wall fight this week. "I think that's a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018," Rubio said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "If we can do some of that now, that would be great. But we cannot shut down the government right now. Mulvaney's hard-line stance is also odds with a White House faction convinced that a government shutdown would be cataclysmic for an administration already struggling to prove its ability to govern, according to GOP aides in the White House and Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks. Republican leaders have signaled that they will concentrate this week on keeping the government open, even if that means ignoring White House calls for action on other major priorities, such as rewriting the tax code and overhauling the ACA. Trump has pushed his staff in recent days to prod House Republicans for final revisions in a health-care proposal that can win support from both the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group. And that task led advisers over the weekend to rely especially on three key players — Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Tuesday Group; Rep. Mark Meadows R-N.C., chairman of the Freedom Caucus; and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House GOP chief deputy whip - to finalize legislation. But the White House's efforts to work directly with various House coalitions and piece together a compromise health-care package has led to private unease on Capitol Hill, where some GOP members close to the leadership have grumbled that Trump aides are setting up the party for defeat or a stumble should the tweaked health bill not have as strong support as the White House has suggested. Trump's advisers, aware of those concerns, still plowed forward Sunday on crafting the bill's language, citing the president's desire for action. There were ongoing conversations about the timing for a health vote, with Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or even sometime in early May, if necessary, discussed as options. Ryan addressed that pressure in a conference call Saturday afternoon, in which he told GOP members that while he hoped that they would continue health-care talks, his top priority will be the stopgap spending bill. "Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support." Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call.

House leaders told GOP lawmakers Saturday that they plan to devote their energy this week to keeping the federal government open, conspicuously avoiding an immediate commitment to take up health care despite pledges to do so by conservatives and the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaking on a conference call with GOP members, offered no specific plan on how or when lawmakers might see details of a new proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act, which White House officials promised would receive a vote by Wednesday. Ryan also made clear that his top priority was to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep government open past April 28, an objective that requires Democratic support. "Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support." Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call. The call comes as GOP leaders find themselves trapped between proving that they can complete basic tasks of governing such as funding the government, while also meeting the demands of President Donald Trump, who is looking for a legislative win ahead of his 100th day in office next Saturday. President Donald Trump is pushing Congress toward another dramatic showdown over the Affordable Care Act, despite big outstanding obstacles to a beleaguered revision plan and a high-stakes deadline next week to keep the government running. The fresh pressure from the White House to pass a revision... President Donald Trump is pushing Congress toward another dramatic showdown over the Affordable Care Act, despite big outstanding obstacles to a beleaguered revision plan and a high-stakes deadline next week to keep the government running. The fresh pressure from the White House to pass a revision... Ryan's comments suggested that he and other House Republicans have made the choice to focus on the former. He said, for instance, that the House will vote on a health-care bill when Republicans are sure they have the support to pass it, according to several GOP aides on the call - suggesting that he does not believe that to be the case currently, despite renewed negotiations between House conservatives, moderates and the White House. Ryan encouraged members to continue discussing ideas, but he did not open the call for questions, leaving members to wait until Wednesday morning before they can weigh in on spending or health care. Trump and his top aides have been calling on Congress to take dramatic action in the coming week: vote on health care, take up tax reform and demand that Democrats agree to a stopgap spending measure that includes funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Ryan attempted to calm the disorder Saturday by telling members that repealing the Affordable Care Act remains a priority but urging them to focus on the immediate task of the budget negotiations, according to the aides on the call. Ryan has vowed for weeks that there will be no government shutdown, and many Republicans and Democrats have said in recent days that negotiations are proceeding apace. At the same time, Trump has publicly downplayed the significance of achieving a victory in the coming week. He dismissed the symbolism of the 100-day mark - despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail that he would meet many of his goals by that date. He also began walking back the health-care promise after signs emerged that GOP leaders were not prepared to take it up because of the risk that it would anger Democrats. "We'll see what happens," Trump said on Friday. "No particular rush, but we'll see what happens." Then, on Saturday, Trump added to the confusion with a promise to release details of a tax overhaul next week. "Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday," he tweeted. Less clear was what will come of Trump's desire to include funding for a border wall in the stopgap measure. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly suggested in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper scheduled to run Sunday morning that Trump may demand the funding. "I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall," Kelly said. "So I would suspect, he'll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding." The comment is likely to further threaten bipartisan budget talks, which were jostled after Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, announced last week that the White House would demand border wall funding in the upcoming spending bill. Such a demand would almost certainly prompt Democrats, whose support is needed to pass the budget bill in the Senate, to vote no. The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... Aides on the Hill and inside the White House, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity, said they believe Trump sees a demand for wall money as the best way to prove that his most controversial proposals can be fulfilled. "This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules," Mulvaney said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Live. "You cannot expect a president who just won election to give up very easily on his highest priority." That demand came as a surprise to Democrats who have been working for more than a month with GOP leaders to craft a bipartisan spending bill that would keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The bipartisan talks were seen as a rare bright spot in an otherwise acrimonious, bitter relationship between Republicans and Democrats in Washington. One particular area of agreement was not to include border-protection funds in the stopgap budget, which, it was agreed, should be debated separately, after government is kept open. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said leaders in Congress could reach a spending agreement, but only the White House stays out of the negotiations. "I want to come up with an agreement," Schumer said Tuesday on a conference call with reporters. "Our Republican colleagues know that since they control, you know, the House, the Senate and the White House, that a shutdown would fall on their shoulders, and they don't want it."

President Donald Trump vowed Wednesday to bring his fight against the sanctuary city movement to the Supreme Court after a federal judge blocked a White House move to withhold funds from municipalities refusing to cooperate with immigration officials. The decision Tuesday by a federal judge in San Francisco dealt another blow to the Trump administration even as it tries to show progress on signature policies in its first 100 days. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Trump vowed that the White House was ready to bring the case to the Supreme Court and blasted the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was part of legal decisions blocking Trump's travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries. "First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!" Trump wrote. U.S. District Judge William Orrick — who imposed a temporary nationwide injunction against Trump's Jan. 25 order — does not serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, though those judges would review his decisions. In an earlier statement, the White House took aim at Orrick, saying his ruling "unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation." "This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge," the White House statement said. Orrick pointed to discrepancies in the administration's interpretation of the executive order, which broadly authorized the attorney general to withhold grant money from jurisdictions that do not cooperate with immigration officials on deportations and other enforcement actions. President Donald Trump speaks at the Interior Department in Washington on April 26, 2017, before signing an Antiquities Executive Order. On Twitter on the same day, Trump vowed to bring the fight over sanctuary city defiance to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump speaks at the Interior Department in Washington on April 26, 2017, before signing an Antiquities Executive Order. On Twitter on the same day, Trump vowed to bring the fight over sanctuary city defiance to the Supreme Court. At the same time, the judge said the Justice Department may hold back grant money that is awarded with immigration-related conditions, if those conditions are violated. The department responded to the ruling by saying it could essentially continue to operate as it had been. The judge's decision largely blocks the administration from doing things its lawyers said in court the agency would not do, such as strip health-care funding from cities and towns. But the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups said the injunction offered a clear warning that Trump's order — the third issued by the president to be blocked, at least partially, in federal court — is illegal. "Once again, the courts have spoken to defend tolerance, diversity and inclusion from the illegal threats of the Trump administration," ACLU National Political Director Faiz Shakir said in a statement. "Once again, Trump has overreached and lost." A federal judge on Tuesday blocked any attempt by the Trump administration to withhold funding from "sanctuary cities" that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials, saying the president has no authority to attach new conditions to federal spending.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued... In court, the government's lawyers suggested cities and towns were overreacting to the order because federal officials have not yet defined sanctuary cities or moved to withhold funding from them. But on television and in news conferences, the judge pointed out, the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have threatened to sanction such jurisdictions. "The result of this schizophrenic approach to the Order is that the Counties' worst fears are not allayed and the Counties reasonably fear enforcement under the Order," the judge wrote. "The threat of the Order and the uncertainty it is causing impermissibly interferes with the Counties' ability to operate, to provide key services, to plan for the future, and to budget." Trump says sanctuary cities put Americans at risk by refusing to hold immigrants who have been arrested or convicted of serious crimes until immigration agents can take them into custody and deport them. Sanctuary cities' officials counter that they do not have the legal authority to hold a person after a judge in a criminal case has ordered that person released. Holding people on immigration offenses is generally a civil process, rather than a criminal one. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Justice Department lawyers are reviewing legal options. "It's the 9th Circuit going bananas," he told reporters Tuesday evening. "The idea that an agency can't put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is going to be overturned eventually, and we'll win at the Supreme Court level at some point."

President Donald Trump's Cabinet secretaries are growing exasperated at how slowly the White House is moving to fill hundreds of top-tier posts, warning that the vacancies are hobbling efforts to oversee agency operations and promote the president's agenda, according to administration officials, lawmakers and lobbyists. The Senate has confirmed 26 of Trump's picks for his Cabinet and other top posts. But for 530 other vacant senior-level jobs requiring Senate confirmation, the president has advanced just 37 nominees, according to data tracked by The Washington Post and the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service's Center for Presidential Transition. These posts include the deputy secretaries and undersecretaries, chief financial officers, ambassadors, general counsels, and heads of smaller agencies who run the government day-to-day. That's less than half the nominees President Barack Obama had sent to the Senate by this point in his first term. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has publicly expressed frustration with the process, has routinely peppered the White House Personnel Office for updates and called Trump directly to press for faster action on filling vacant jobs at the Interior Department, said two people familiar with his contacts, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for this report because of the sensitivity of hiring discussions. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price aired his dismay at a recent breakfast meeting with his former congressional colleagues. "He's very frustrated," said a Republican House member who was there. "He felt it was much more difficult to operate the department and provide the leadership level that you need to provide." Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has become so impatient that she has tapped an outside consultant to help her identify candidates for top jobs and shepherd them through the White House nomination process, said two people with knowledge of the situation, including one who is close to both Chao and the consultant. In part, the delay in filling leadership posts is the result of a chaotic transition after Trump won the November election. Just days after his victory, Trump dumped New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) as transition director and jettisoned much of his work, replacing him with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. But the nomination process has also been slowed by the unusual degree of scrutiny the White House is giving job candidates. Prospective nominees for senior posts and even some of the more junior ones must win approval from competing camps inside the White House, according to close Trump associates and Republican lobbyists. Around the table for weekly hiring meetings are chief strategist Stephen Bannon, representing the populist wing; Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, leading the establishment Republican wing; White House Counsel Don McGahn; Pence's chief of staff, Josh Peacock; and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, representing a business-oriented faction, according to a lobbyist and several White House officials. For economic appointments, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, also sits in, as does the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, when a hiring decision piques her interest. *Estimated totals based on congressional records and a White House press release on Tuesday, 96 days into the Trump presidency.

Source: Partnership for Public Service. "We make sure the people involved in hiring decisions don't have an objection," Priebus said. "To get to that point, you've gone through a long process. If someone has a serious objection, unless it can be resolved, it's probably not going to move forward." Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser who served as a communications director under President George W. Bush, said requiring so many White House figures to sign off on appointments can be unusually cumbersome. "There are big differences among them about the people they're talking about putting in these positions," Bennett said. "Of course, it's going to take longer." Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, who stays in regular touch with White House officials, said the drawn-out hiring process is leaving Cabinet secretaries "stuck in most instances." In the interim, the secretaries are relying on civil servants in acting leadership roles, which can create an uneasy relationship given the Trump administration's aim of upending many traditional agency functions. To accelerate the process of filling top posts at the Transportation Department, Chao has hired Edmund Moy to help identify candidates to staff her office and to head 10 agencies within her department. He is also guiding them through the White House nomination process. Chao worked closely with Moy when she was labor secretary under Bush and Moy was a White Office personnel official responsible for hiring senior figures at the Labor Department and other agencies. A Transportation Department spokeswoman said the department is about halfway toward filling its vacancies. "Our focus remains on aligning a top-notch team to carry out the priorities of the department and the administration." Attorney General Jeff Sessions faces perhaps a more daunting challenge at the Justice Department, which has openings for all 93 U.S. attorneys around the country and vacancies atop its divisions. When a reporter asked Sessions last week how he can pursue Trump's tough-on-crime agenda with so many vacancies, Sessions said, "We really need to work hard at that." The Interior Department, a more modest agency, may have far fewer top posts to fill, but with 16 senior jobs still empty, Zinke has been airing his "frustration on the process." In remarks to journalists this month, as reported by E&E News, Zinke said: "A lot of it - the executive branch is no different than any branch - is the frustration of the bureaucracy. . . . We're working with the White House every day" to get the nominations out. At the Education Department, Secretary Betsy DeVos has devised a strategy to compensate for her depleted senior ranks. She is leaning heavily on the staff of Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a former education secretary who now chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, a former top aide to the senator said. Alexander's aides are involved on behalf of the agency in working with state governments to put in place a new law that shifts much of the federal role in elementary and secondary education to the states. "The chairman is committed to providing any assistance the secretary requests," an aide to Alexander said. Offering this kind of assistance, the aide said, "is standard practice" for the committee. DeVos had hoped to have her own staff in place to manage the major shifts the administration hopes to make in education. She had backed New Mexico Education Secretary Hanna Skandera for assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, but the White House soured on her after some Senate Republicans raised concerns about her support for Common Core standards, Politico reported. DeVos had wanted to have a deputy by now. The name of Indiana businessman Allan Hubbard has surfaced as a possible deputy education secretary. Although he has yet to be nominated, Hubbard has already joined a team of Education Department officials meeting with potential candidates for other top agency posts, according to a Republican with knowledge of the discussions. Across the government, there are posts for 16 deputy secretaries, but only two have been filled so far: Elaine Duke at the Department of Homeland Security and Rod Rosenstein, who was confirmed for a Justice post Tuesday. Trump has nominated five others, though one of them, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, withdrew his name for consideration to be commerce deputy secretary last week, citing difficulties in complying with rules on avoiding financial conflicts. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has been pushing coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler for his agency's No. 2 job, another Republican lobbyist said, but the White House has not signed off, almost two months after Wheeler's name surfaced. In the winter, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson picked Elliott Abrams, a national security veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, to be his deputy secretary. Abrams said he met with Kushner and Trump but was told that Bannon vetoed the choice. Abrams had been critical of Trump during the election campaign. And at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis withdrew his top choice for undersecretary for policy in March after the White House told him it would not fight an expected battle for Senate confirmation for retired senior diplomat Anne Patterson. While the president has since named several candidates for senior defense positions, the policy post, arguably the most important person on the secretary's team, is still held by an acting career official. The White House announced Tuesday that Randolph D. "Tex" Alles, a senior customs official and retired Marine Corps general, would take over the U.S. Secret Service, becoming the agency's 25th director. Alles spent 35 years in the Marines before retiring in 2011, according to the White House. He... The White House announced Tuesday that Randolph D. "Tex" Alles, a senior customs official and retired Marine Corps general, would take over the U.S. Secret Service, becoming the agency's 25th director. Alles spent 35 years in the Marines before retiring in 2011, according to the White House. He... Mattis has skirmished with the White House over other appointments as well and told colleagues he is frustrated by the delays, especially since he had insisted on being able to choose his team, according to current and former national security officials. The screening of potential nominees for conflicts of interest arising from their business activities has contributed to the lengthy nomination process in some instances. White House officials said they have given preliminary approval to more than 200 job candidates who are now undergoing vetting by the FBI and the Office of Government Ethics before being nominated and sent to the Senate for confirmation. Johnny DeStefano, who heads the White House Personnel Office, said he aims to ensure that the president's key advisers have no objections before advancing the name of a prospective nominee. "Generally, we just have a discussion about each of the individuals," DeStefano said. "I'm there to represent all of the White House interests. The goal is that by the time [the decision] gets to the president, he understands that everybody is on the same page." DeStefano defended the pace of nominations, saying the White House is "making sure we find, in as deliberative a fashion as we can, the right mix of folks . . . who have experience driving change, who understand what the problems are." But Clay Johnson III, who led the White House personnel operation during Bush's first term, said the hiring process during that administration was much more streamlined and he routinely presented the president with two dozen names to approve each week. Although hires for senior jobs had to pass muster with chief of staff Andrew Card and political strategist Karl Rove, fewer White House officials had a veto over nominations. "People didn't automatically say, 'I have a say in this,' " Johnson recalled.

Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross singled out changes to the nation's free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday as "the first thing" he would address if confirmed to lead the Commerce Department in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Speaking before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ross argued that the United States should open its economic borders to countries that "play by the rules." But those that do not, he said, "should be punished - severely." "I am not anti-trade. I am pro trade," Ross said. "But I am pro sensible trade, not pro trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community." Several of Trump's Cabinet nominees are facing potentially bruising confirmation battles. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., who is under consideration to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has been embroiled in controversy over his ownership of healthcare stocks while crafting legislation that could have affected those businesses. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, the nominee to lead the White House budget office, failed to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in the early 2000s related to a worker hired to help care for his newborn triplets, according to federal disclosures. Cabinet nominees must undergo routine vetting and disclose their financial holdings as part of their confirmation process. During Wednesday's hearing, Ross acknowledged that one of his household employees recently was not able to provide proof of legal residency. Ross said the person had presented a valid Social Security card and driver's license at the time of hiring in 2009. A Commerce committee aide said the employee said the only driver's license the employee could recently produce had expired. As president, Donald Trump won't be able to punish General Motors for building cars in Mexico without violating NAFTA. That may not stop him from taking an unprecedented step against an American company. Trade experts agree that presidents have wide latitude to impose penalties on imports, at least... As president, Donald Trump won't be able to punish General Motors for building cars in Mexico without violating NAFTA. That may not stop him from taking an unprecedented step against an American company. Trade experts agree that presidents have wide latitude to impose penalties on imports, at least... On Wednesday, Ross said the employee has been fired. He also said he paid all taxes required under that person's employment. Still, Ross appeared to face an easy path to confirmation, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle praising his testimony Wednesday. Commerce Chairman Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., called Ross's stance on trade "reassuring" even though it broke with Republican's free-trade orthodoxy. Ranking Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Ross's answers were "detailed" and "non-evasive" and called the hearing "a piece of cake." Trump made renegotiating trade agreements a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, tapping into the frustration of many middle-class workers who have felt left behind by globalization. Since his election, Trump has already begun wielding the power of the bully pulpit, repeatedly calling for a border tax on U.S. companies that offshore jobs and sell their products back home. He has taken to task individual companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota for investing in Mexico, sending their stock prices plummeting. But he has touted new U.S. jobs created by telecom giant Sprint and pharmaceutical maker Bayer AG. Ross was a close adviser to Trump during the election campaign, and he is slated to take the leading role in setting trade policy in the new administration. Trump has named economist Peter Navarro to head a new manufacturing council within the White House and picked trade veteran Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative, in charge of negotiating agreements. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a blanket 35 percent tax on Mexican imports and a 45 percent tariff on goods from China. In a recent interview with the German newspaper Bild, he also suggested imposing a 35 percent tax on German cars sold in the United States. "When you start out with the adverse party understanding that he or she is going to have to make concessions, that's a pretty good background to begin" negotiations, Ross said Wednesday. It is unclear if those measures are part of the border tax that Trump has pushed, and international trade experts say they are likely a violation of long-standing treaties. In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Trump criticized a tax plan by House Republicans intended to discourage imports known as "border adjustment." Ross indicated Wednesday that tariffs were an essential component of U.S. trade policy. However, he acknowledged that protectionist measures implemented during the Great Depression only served to deepen the nation's economic distress. "I think tariffs play a role both as a negotiating tool and to punish offenders that don't play by the rules," he said. Trump's top trade advisers have also raised concerns about China's growing power in the world economy. Navarro has been particularly dire in his warnings, writing a book entitled "Death By China." Ross, who collects Chinese art and has extensive business interests in the country, sounded a stern but less strident tone in his testimony Wednesday. He said companies manipulate their currencies as a strategy for "attacking" the American economy, though he did not mention Trump's pledge to label China a currency manipulator on the president-elect's first day in office. "China is the most protectionist country of very large countries," Ross said. Ross amassed his fortune by investing in the industries that were hit hardest by the forces of globalization -- including steel, coal and textile. He recently announced he would step down down from his position on the board of directors at ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, in advance of his confirmation. According to Bloomberg, Ross's financial disclosures revealed assets of more than $330 million, with his net worth estimated at $2.9 billion. During his testimony, Ross said he would be "scrupulous in recusal" to prevent any conflicts of interest with his vast business empire. But he said his wide-ranging investments also provided him insight into the minutiae of trade law and said his companies have been the victims of unfair practices. On Wednesday, he called for tougher enforcement of U.S. trade laws, arguing that countries often delay cases by failing to provide paperwork and that billions of dollars in penalties go uncollected. That hard-line stance has helped him win support from the United Steelworkers, which had backed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton during the election. Ross's testimony was briefly interrupted by protesters criticizing him for his early support of the sweeping trade agreement with Asia known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of President Barack Obama's signature achievements. The deal has since become politically toxic, and Trump has vowed to pull out of the agreement once in office. Ross said Wednesday that he changed his mind after analyzing the details of the agreement, raising concerns about what he said were lax requirements on auto parts manufacturing. "I came across some things that I felt were not consistent with things that had been advertised," he said. Ross also highlighted proposals to encourage domestic growth, including spending on infrastructure. During the campaign, Ross and Navarro suggested a $137 billion tax credit that they said could spur $1 trillion in private-sector spending on infrastructure projects with a regular revenue stream, such as toll roads. That proposal was widely panned by economists as unrealistic, but Ross defended it on Wednesday. Ross said the tax credits should be one of several efforts by the federal government to boost infrastructure spending. Several top Republican lawmakers have questioned the need for additional government spending, however, and Ross did not propose a way to pay for those proposals. "The infrastructure needs of this country are so monumental that we need any available source of capital in order to meet it on a timely basis," he said.

She knew to hold her tongue during a business trip to Chicago the night Donald Trump was elected, and endured a long evening of schmoozing with the other sales reps and executives. Back in her hotel room the next morning, Lisa drew a hot bath and sobbed. Then her sadness turned to an anger that startled even her. The 55-year-old mom, never particularly active in politics, went outside, looked up at the nearby Trump Tower office building and flipped the icon of the new president the double bird. From that point, there was no turning back. Within days she had organized a Trump resistance group, donned a pink pussyhat and drove 14 hours with a carload of like-minded crusaders to the Women’s March in Washington. “We’re all terrified at what’s going on — that our country is going to be somehow ruined,” said Lisa, who kick-started early retirement to focus almost full time on civic activism. Even so, she’s reluctant to allow her full name to be used, worried about how her efforts could affect her life and her family. President Trump’s election has mobilized thousands of first-time activists in a do-it-yourself movement like nothing seen on the political left in years. With bountiful energy and some impressive early successes, the grass-roots movement has stunned even Democratic Party officials, drawing comparisons to the tea party movement that transformed the GOP with its unyielding opposition after President Obama’s election. Women nationwide — and much of the movement is being fueled by women — are organizing via Facebook, email and often tearful support meetings around kitchen tables. The Indivisible Project, launched after Trump’s election, has already sprouted nearly 6,000 chapters nationwide, at least two in each of the 435 congressional districts. More established activist groups like MoveOn.org — which holds weekly “Resist Trump Tuesdays” protests — are enjoying a surge in membership, particularly in blue states, but most surprisingly in some deep-red pockets, where liberals had largely kept quieter. One Colorado activist said that in past years, event turnout rarely matched the number of advance sign-ups; now it routinely surpasses it. These newly minted activists — along with other long-standing protest groups on the left — flooded the U.S. Capitol switchboard during Senate confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet, pushed Democrats to filibuster Neil M. Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination and helped tank the president’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — often by noisily protesting at lawmakers’ town hall meetings. With old-school organizing and modern-day social media they have formed instant communities that can mobilize hundreds — even thousands — as a group of stay-at-home moms in Kenosha, Wis., did recently to protest Trump’s visit there. “We always told our kids there’s a lot of really smart people in our country, and we all want to make it better,” said Julia Kozel, one of the women who organized the Kenosha rally. “But I don’t feel like I could say that anymore.” Like the tea party activists before them, many of the resisters — as they call themselves — are newcomers to the political process. And much in the same way tea party activists grieved for the country they no longer recognized under Obama, these women recount being devastated that fellow Americans elected Trump and say they are fighting to restore their own vision of the country. Publicly, Democratic officials embrace the newfound energy on the left. Party strategists even marvel at the large turnouts that they had been unable to achieve in recent years. But privately, many Democrats also worry the movement is whipping up a deep-rooted emotional and ideological fervor, much like the tea party did in blocking Obama’s agenda. Unpredictable and with no clear leadership, the liberal uprising could prove difficult to contain and may turn its anger — currently focused on Trump — toward the Democratic Party itself, just as the tea party fractured the GOP. Wounds from the 2016 primary battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont still run deep among Democrats, and the protest movement could split the party further between moderates and progressives. Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a favorite among progressives, found herself under fire after voting to confirm Housing Secretary Ben Carson. Some progressives threatened to challenge the Massachusetts liberal in the next primary. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein felt pressured enough to hold her first town hall in years early this month. There she was heckled as a “sellout” from an occasionally rowdy crowd of liberals. When airport protests erupted over Trump’s first travel ban, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) raced to Dulles International Airport to demonstrate his solidarity. “No party is safe,” said Jeanne Peters, a jewelry designer in West Virginia, whose Indivisible chapter has started calling its House member and both its Republican and Democratic senator every weekday with a coordinated message, such as demanding a congressional vote on Syrian airstrikes or opposing the GOP healthcare plan. If the threat from the left wasn’t evident enough, a new political action committee, #WeWillRreplaceYou, is raising money to back primary campaigns against Democrats they view as insufficiently progressive — much the way outside conservative groups targeted “RINOs,” politicians they considered Republicans in Name Only. Voters who are “fed up with the Democratic Party at every level want to see their Democratic representatives stand up and fight Trump,” said Claire Sandberg, a former Sanders organizer who is a cofounder of the PAC. Another group run by former Sanders allies, Brand New Congress, is recruiting challengers for every single House district — Democrats and Republicans alike — in 2018. Rep. Ted Lieu, a progressive from California known even in Oshkosh for his pointed tweets about the president, acknowledged the risk for Democrats as passions run like nothing he has ever seen. “People call my office all the time, and they want President Trump impeached two months ago,” he said. “We just have to tamp down expectations.” The groups make it no secret that they are using the tea party playbook to fight Trump. “The tea party had a method of organizing that works,” said Hillary Shields, 32, a paralegal whose Indivisible group drew nearly 150 to a Saturday spring training for activists in Kansas City, Mo. “Why reinvent the wheel?” Ezra Levin, a former Capitol Hill staffer who is president of the Indivisible Project, helped fuel the movement by posting online a how-to organizing guide that borrows heavily from the tea party. “The goal of this tactic isn’t just to target Republicans. It’s to stiffen the spines of Democrats,” he said. But while the resistance groups share many similarities with the tea party, it remains to be seen how far they are willing to go to block Trump’s agenda. Would they be willing to shut down the government, as the tea party did over Obamacare, for their own priorities — say, to save Planned Parenthood or stop Trump’s travel ban? The moms sitting around the dining room table at Kozel’s house the day after the Kenosha protest shake their heads no, saying they wouldn’t want to disrupt government operations or break laws with civil disobedience. “Our endgame is getting people elected,” said Kozel, as three of her school-age kids munched doughnuts and played nearby. But others know playing nicely may only go so far. Many women said that the Democratic Party needs to be more progressive — and they are trying to push the party in that direction. Among the new activists is Lisa E. Hansen, 51, a former graphic artist who had never been politically active much beyond casting her vote. “And then the election happened,” said Hansen, after she and others wrote postcards to lawmakers at her Oshkosh home. She said she sunk into a depression, spending her days scouring the news to make sense of it all. Only when protesters turned out for the Women’s March did she think to herself: “I can do that.” Now every Tuesday, Hansen, who is partly disabled by Lyme disease, puts her walker in the trunk of her family’s car and heads to downtown Oshkosh to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s office, where a few dozen resisters have been protesting every week since the inauguration. She dials up the senator’s office on Mondays to say that her group is coming and would like a meeting. The senator has not agreed to meet with them. But his staff comes out to hear their concerns, and sometimes Hansen brings them snacks. On a recent Tuesday, more than two dozen protesters quietly formed a neat line outside the office with homemade signs reading, “Not paying for Trump’s wall!” and “Don’t let Wisconsin values be Trump’d.” The Tuesday protests were supposed to last only for the first 100 days of the new administration. But as that date approaches, no one wants to quit, so they agreed to extend it for another 100 days. “It’s given me a sense of purpose,” Hansen said. “Maybe we should send Donald Trump a thank-you note. He brought all of us together.”

Holding red and white signs, they protested outside Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s election party on Tuesday, demanding the city take a tougher stand against deportation. The next day, they rallied in support of the International Women’s Day strike, demanding social and economic equality for women. These weren’t liberals. They were card-carrying members of the Democratic Socialists of America, one of the fastest growing groups on the American left. The surge of activism sweeping the U.S. since Donald Trump’s election has energized the nation’s largest socialist organization, which has tripled in size over the last year to claim more than 19,000 dues-paying members. That’s a record for the DSA, which was founded in 1982. “People really felt that they had to do something to combat the incoming Trump administration,” said David Duhalde, the deputy director of the Democratic Socialists of America’s national leadership, which helps coordinate chapters spread across 40 states. “We’re not only somebody you can resist Trump with, we’re somebody you can build a better world with.” There’s no doubt that the grassroots group forms only a small part of America’s swelling ranks of activists. The American Civil Liberties Union amassed hundreds of thousands of new members after Trump’s victory. The fast-growing and liberal-centric “Indivisible” movement claims 4,500 associated groups compared with the 121 chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America. As far as political parties go, California alone boasts 8.7 million registered Democrats. But unabashed socialism hasn’t had this big of a voice in American politics in decades, and many leftists say they feel energized. New members of the Democratic Socialists of America say they want build a grassroots movement engaged at the local level — and either pull the Democratic Party leftward or shove it out of the way. That’s why, on election night, as Garcetti won one of the most commanding mayoral victories in Los Angeles history, dozens of socialists protested outside his election party. A few of the group’s provocateurs infiltrated the well-dressed crowd of Democrats inside, where they shouted against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: “I.C.E. out of L.A.!” “If you’re gonna do it, have some fun,” said Josh Androsky, a 30-year-old stand-up comedian who co-chairs the Los Angeles chapter’s “agit-prop” committee and who joined after Trump’s election. “A large portion of our members were radicalized by the election and the Democrats failing over and over again.” The Democratic Socialists of America’s membership spike seems driven by three factors: younger Americans, who polls say are more open to socialism than previous generations; the 2016 Democratic primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist whose race ignited a grassroots following but also left bitter feelings about the Democratic Party; and the galvanizing effect that Trump’s election has had on left-leaning Americans, who have increasingly turned to grassroots activism. Kevin Joerger, 24, of Los Angeles, is the classic example. He first got involved with politics when he volunteered for Sanders’ campaign, and when Trump won, “I had to do something more to stay sane,” Joerger said. Although he “rooted, sort of” for Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Party didn’t satisfy him. Joerger said he felt that big business had taken over politics and that capitalism had failed Americans individually, and he wanted “to be part of a movement in my community and see change locally, and not just nationwide.” So he joined the Democratic Socialists of America, which places more power in the hands of its local chapters rather than its national leadership and stresses building coalitions with community groups. Among leftists, the DSA is considered a “big-tent” organization. Decisions are made by topic-specific committees instead of through adherence to rigid ideology, which allows for a relatively wider range of opinion than other groups. The group also takes a more incremental approach to reining in free-market capitalism. “As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,” says the group’s website. “Our vision is of a society in which people have a real voice in the choices and relationships that affect the entirety of our lives.” It’s yet to be seen what kind of impact the group might have. Socialism has never been a dominant force in American electoral politics. Previously, its most successful American leader was Eugene V. Debs, who won 6% of the presidential vote in 1912 running on the Socialist Party of America ticket. And although some conservatives view the Democratic Socialists of America as subversive radicals, other leftists see them as not nearly radical enough. “The farthest they can go is supporting elements such as Bernie Sanders,” Marc Wells, a Trotskyist, said disdainfully as he handed out leaflets for the World Socialist Web Site at the International Women’s Day strike in Los Angeles, where some Democratic Socialists of America members had also gathered. The site is published by the International Committee of the Fourth International, which, like other Marxist groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, advocate harder-line approaches than the DSA. In Wells’ view, Sanders and “pseudo-left reformism” only perpetuates capitalism rather than leading to a necessary revolution, and the result is that “the working class is led back into the Democratic Party.” By contrast, Wells said, “We seek to prepare the working class to seize political power.” Duhalde, the DSA’s deputy national director, said the group is “flexible and willing to change” compared to other leftist approaches. “There’s been a huge generational shift of millennials who are going to reinvent the socialist project,” Duhalde said, adding that more than half of new members who joined since Trump’s victory are younger than 30. Many new members say they heard about the group on Twitter, where Democratic Socialists of America members and supporters often put red rose emojis next to their user handles, an armband for the digital era. New enlistees have posted photos of their membership cards, which show their names along with the title “official socialist organizer.” One of the group’s biggest online boosters is the actor and comedian Rob Delaney, star of the TV show “Catastrophe,” a Sanders supporter who regularly exhorts his 1.36 million Twitter followers to join the Democratic Socialists of America. Like many DSA members, Delaney favors single-payer healthcare, in which the government covers healthcare costs, and he’s been impressed by the government-run National Health Service in Britain, where he films his show. He once carried $50,000 in medical debt in the U.S. following surgeries he’d needed after a car accident even though he was insured, and he thinks the system is unfair to women as well as the poor. “If you're not lying to yourself you recognize that income inequality and systemic racism/misogyny work really really well to keep the poor poor and make the rich richer. And that's not okay to me,” Delaney said in private messages on Twitter. “DSA's ideas weave all that together in a very pragmatic and actionable way. And they're fantastic organizers,” Delaney continued. “DSA espouses and promotes these issues in a way I really really like and believe is the best way to defeat Trump and the GOP.” matt.pearce@latimes.com @mattdpearce

Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained roars of approval from a friendly crowd on Monday as he called for a radical transformation of the Democratic Party into a grassroots movement founded on the tenets of his unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign: fighting against the billionaire class and rigged economic and political systems. Sanders, of Vermont, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who faced some boos as he spoke, launched a cross-country tour together in Maine, where Sanders won the Democratic presidential caucuses. The tour will take them from Maine to eight other states, including Florida, Arizona, Montana and Nevada. Sanders, who ran as a Democrat against Hillary Clinton but returned to the Senate as an independent, said the Democratic Party must stop ignoring half the nation's states and take on corporate greed on behalf of the working class. Perez urged attendees to resist Republican President Donald Trump by winning seats in Congress, statehouses and school boards. "That's what we will do: Fight like hell with you," Perez said. A crowd of roughly 1,200 filled the State Theatre, with the loudest cheers for Sanders and jeers at mentions of the "1 percent" and Trump's executive orders and proposed budget cuts. "Our vision for the future of this country is a very different vision than yours," Sanders said, as he called for living wages, protecting Planned Parenthood and fighting income inequality. He also said he's introducing legislation to create a single-payer health care system. Some in the crowd also booed at the first mention of the Democratic National Committee. Perez's predecessor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned after Sanders' campaign pounced on leaked emails that they said showed party officials had favored Clinton during the primaries. Republicans had hoped Tuesday's special election in Georgia's wealthy and sleepy 6th Congressional District would be just like every other House race here since 1978: the mostly painless elevation of a rock-ribbed and polished conservative. Those hopes have died. Now, this suburban swath north... Republicans had hoped Tuesday's special election in Georgia's wealthy and sleepy 6th Congressional District would be just like every other House race here since 1978: the mostly painless elevation of a rock-ribbed and polished conservative. Those hopes have died. Now, this suburban swath north... Some attendees said it's time to unite and reform the Democratic Party, while others said they're skeptical of the political establishment and big money in politics. Sean Potter, a Sanders supporter and musician from Falmouth, said he was curious to hear from Sanders, whom he noted "kind of got shafted by" the Democratic Party. Sanders' appearance comes as Democratic parties nationwide are trying to appeal to the working class in states including Maine, where a resurgent Republican Party in the last decade has gained ground in rural communities roiled by the closing of paper mills and sluggish economic growth. Sanders drew thousands to a rally at the civic center in Portland in July 2015, showing he was more than a fringe candidate. In the end, he earned nearly two-thirds of the ballots cast in Maine's Democratic presidential caucuses to beat Clinton. Clinton, though, won the party's presidential nomination. Sanders also did well in rural areas that supported Republican candidate Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, in the primary and Trump in the November election. Troy Jackson, a logger from the northern Maine town of Allagash and the Maine Democratic Senate leader, said it's time that Democrats to work harder for those communities. "Where I'm from, people live their lives far removed from the powerful elites that seem to hold their destinies in their hands," he said. Jackson also said he's "heard from a lot of pundits that the average American feels powerless." "We know it's rigged," he said. Elissa Moore drove two hours to the rally from Dover-Foxcroft, where she voted for Clinton but has remained a "big fan" of Sanders. She's increasingly become involved with politics since Trump's inauguration and worries that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people will suffer under his administration. "Republicans picked up on something, whether it was racism or small-town America not feeling respected or understood," said Moore, a mother and occupational therapist. "Democrats have the reputation of being elitist. That offended people when they went to vote."

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a freshman from a safe seat in Chicago's suburbs, was just about to deliver his speech against the American Health Care Act when he heard a commotion on the House floor. The bill was being pulled. Democrats, who up until that moment thought the Republicans might yank a rabbit out of the hat, began celebrating, and Krishnamoorthi thought back to election night, when he learned that he would be coming to Washington with President Donald Trump. "I thought this repeal bill would sail through," he said. "It was the president's number one priority. And what was incredible about this process was the phone calls -- we had 1,959 phone calls in opposition to the American Health Care Act. We had 30 for it." On Friday afternoon, as congressional Democrats learned that the GOP had essentially given up on repealing the Affordable Care Act, none of them took the credit. They had never really cohered around an anti-AHCA message. (As recently as Wednesday, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi was still using the phrase "make America sick again," which most Democrats had abandoned.) They'd been sidelined legislatively, as Republicans tried to pass a bill on party lines. They'd never called supporters to the Capitol for a show of force, as Republicans had done, several times, during the 2009-2010 fight to pass the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Democrats watched as a roiling, well-organized "resistance" bombarded Republicans with calls and filled their town hall meetings with skeptics. The Indivisible coalition, founded after the 2016 election by former congressional aides who knew how to lobby their old bosses, was the newest and flashiest. But it was joined by MoveOn, which reported 40,000 calls to congressional offices from its members; by Planned Parenthood, directly under the AHCA's gun; by the Democratic National Committee, fresh off a divisive leadership race; and by the AARP, which branded the bill as an "age tax" before Democrats had come up with a counterattack. Congressional Democrats did prime the pump. After their surprise 2016 defeat, they made Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the outreach director of the Senate caucus. Sanders's first project was "Our First Stand," a series of rallies around the country, organized by local Democrats and following a simple format. Elected officials would speak; they would then pass the microphone to constituents who had positive stories to tell about the ACA. President Trump addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. President Trump addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. "What we're starting to do, for the first time in the modern history of the Democratic Party, is active grass-roots organizing," Sanders said in a January interview. "We're working with unions, we're working with senior groups, and we're working with health-care groups. We're trying to rally the American people so we can do what they want. And that is not the repeal of the Affordable Care Act." The turnout for the rallies exceeded expectations, though their aggregate total, over 70-odd cities, would be dwarfed by the Women's March one week later. More importantly, they proved that there was a previously untapped well of goodwill for the ACA -- which had polled negatively for seven years -- and it smoothed over divisions inside the party. Days after Barack Obama had blamed "Bernie Sanders supporters" for undermining support for the ACA, Sanders was using his campaign mailing list to save the law. "It was the town halls, and the stories, that convinced me that people might actually stop this bill," said Tom Perriello, a former Democratic congressman now running an insurgent campaign for governor of Virginia, with his career-ending vote for the ACA front and center. The outsider approach to lobbying grew from there, in ways that quickly came to worry Republicans. Indivisible-affiliated groups advertised congressional town halls and flooded them. Like the Jan. 14 rallies, the town hall tactic mirrored what the tea party movement did in 2009. Like the Democrats of that year, many Republicans responded glibly, blaming out-of-state (or district) rabble-rousers and searching for the invisible hand of George Soros. Among the Republicans who took the protests seriously was Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who would go on to oppose AHCA from the right. "I don't know if we're going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active," Brooks told a radio host in February. "They're putting pressure on congressman and there's not a counter-effort to steel the spine of some of these congressmen in tossup districts around the country." Beltway groups were helping organize the opposition, and did not pretend otherwise. But they were effective because they had actual grass-roots buy-in. Elizabeth Juviler co-founded an Indivisible group in the district of Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J. "He'd never taken a position against the party," Juviler said in an interview. "By all accounts, he's an affable person, but he wasn't accessible." The group, NJ11th for Change, birddogged the Republican congressman with two tactics. First, it held mock town hall events in all four of the counties he represented. "Thousands" of people showed, according to Juviler; all were informed of how to call his office. When the health-care bill was dropped, Frelinghuysen was besieged with calls. And on Friday, he announced that he would oppose AHCA. According to Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the Working Families Party, there were dozens of stories like that. "For the first time in a long time, a pretty sizable number of Republicans were more scared of grass-roots energy of the left than of primaries on the right," said Dinkin. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Helpless to defeat the bill with their numbers -- and not even consulted by Republicans who intended to push it through -- Democrats counted on the grass-roots energy to grind the majority down. There was no big rally at the Capitol, because the activism in districts was seen as more effective. "Those big rallies get a lot of media coverage, but they're not effective," said Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. This week, as Republicans fumbled the AHCA, Democrats held relatively low-key events to draw attention to their fight. At each, they credited activists with slowing down the bill, and derided Republicans for being led by Trump's whims. "Organizers had a first victory today," said Rep. Primila Jayapal, D-Wash., at a small CPC rally after the bill's delay Thursday. "Across the country, they pummeled Republicans for this horrible bill." And when the bill was pulled, Pelosi joined a rally of just a few dozen people across from the Capitol, organized by MoveOn.org. She took off her heels and led the crowd in a literal jump for joy, as the members of her emboldened caucus began fundraising off the Republican failure. "You organized across the country," read a fundraising email from Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., after the vote. "You showed up to Republicans' townhalls and told them your stories about the ACA saving your life. You called your Representatives and asked them to vote no. Members of Congress reported receiving thousands of calls from constituents almost uniformly against repeal." Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote.

Republicans had hoped Tuesday's special election in Georgia's wealthy and sleepy 6th Congressional District would be just like every other House race here since 1978: the mostly painless elevation of a rock-ribbed and polished conservative. Those hopes have died. Now, this suburban swath north of Atlanta resembles the cracked mirror of the GOP's national identity crisis, with 11 candidates bitterly feuding over what it means to be a Republican in the age of President Donald Trump. That crowded field is roiled by nerves about Trump and lingering internecine dramas over ideological purity. And with next year's midterm elections beginning to take shape, the race's currents could reverberate far beyond the white college-educated professionals along Interstate 285, regardless of which candidate emerges from the scrum Tuesday. "You've got a miniature civil war going on there," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., an ally of House GOP leaders. "We're all paying attention, since anything can happen in a special." The splintered GOP has raised the possibility that the leading Democratic candidate, 30-year-old former congressional staffer Jon Ossoff, could win Tuesday's election outright with more than 50 percent of the vote, thus claiming an open House seat previously held by Trump's health and human services secretary, Tom Price. Trump - who barely won this district last year and tweeted Monday that the media coverage of the race was a "game" and "BAD!" -- is eager to stave off a Republican stumble that could become an ominous bellwether of his standing as he attempts to build support in the coming weeks for the big-ticket legislative items that have eluded him in the GOP-controlled Congress during the early months of his presidency. Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price's seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November's election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former... Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price's seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November's election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former... If Ossoff places first or second with support in the mid-40 percent range among the 18 total candidates - surveys show that scenario as most likely -- he will face a tougher matchup this summer, when many of the warring Republicans would almost certainly coalesce to save the seat. Georgia's election law initially piles candidates of all stripes onto a single ballot. If no one wins a majority, the two top finishers move on to a head-to-head contest months later. "Having 11 people on our side is like eating our young," Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., a friend of Trump, said in an interview Monday. He compared the infighting to the "nightmare" of his own 2014 statewide primary and added: "You risk letting the Democrat slide through without a runoff. But I don't think that will happen if we get the turnout." Democratic congressional leaders and liberals from around the country have rallied for Ossoff as Republicans have clawed at one another, contributing millions to his insurgent bid and watching him soar to the top of several polls -- and salivating at the prospect of picking up a seat that hasn't gone blue since Georgia's own Jimmy Carter occupied the Oval Office. Republicans survived an embarrassing scare and narrowly held on to a Kansas congressional seat Tuesday in a special election that served as a surprising red-state referendum on President Trump. The single-digit victory for state Treasurer Ron Estes marked a far closer race than Democrats have pulled... Republicans survived an embarrassing scare and narrowly held on to a Kansas congressional seat Tuesday in a special election that served as a surprising red-state referendum on President Trump. The single-digit victory for state Treasurer Ron Estes marked a far closer race than Democrats have pulled... Trump has become a complicated figure in establishment Republican enclaves such as Chamblee, which boasts a tony shopping center with a gourmet doughnut shop and a sleek Mexican restaurant whose patio is packed in the evenings with 30-something couples. Passing through the leafy neighborhood on a warm Monday afternoon, one sees a slew of navy-blue Ossoff signs dotting sidewalks and apartment windows. Republicans' failure to pass their plan to overhaul the nation's health-care system has sown doubts among some suburban GOP voters about Trump's effectiveness in cutting deals with lawmakers in Washington, as well as the party's promises. The health-care episode has particular resonance in this district since Price, a physician, was its representative from 2005 until February, when he joined the Cabinet. Cole said the National Republican Congressional Committee, which he formerly chaired, has dispatched staffers to Georgia to stoke turnout among core GOP voters amid those grumbles. The Congressional Leadership Fund, an outfit aligned with the House GOP, has spent more than $2 million on a spate of negative television spots about Ossoff. At the White House, an official said, the president is paying close attention and has been briefed by aides about the race. Political director Bill Stepien is working with the state party and the congressional committees. Chief strategist Stephen Bannon is involved in discussions about how to encourage Republican turnout. But Trump's pugilism and lack of a cohesive conservative worldview on fiscal and foreign policy have confounded Republicans here. Previous holders of the seat have included a mainstream, business-friendly Republican, Sen. Johnny Isakson, and a stridently ideological conservative, former House speaker Newt Gingrich. The district is "a little bit of an oddity," said Ralph Reed, a conservative leader and longtime strategist in both Georgia and national Republican circles. "Just in its socioeconomic profile, it doesn't really lay out as Trump country. It's highly educated, upscale, suburban, and Trump country tends to be more rural to exurban, more high school or only some college." The way the Republican contenders are handling Trump and the concurrent rise of populism and moderate angst in the wake of his victory is revealing, even though the names of the near-dozen candidates are unfamiliar. Everyone seems to be laboring, with varying success, to figure out a pitch that pulls together the fractured GOP ranks. Interactions with Trump's political brand have veered from hearty embrace (Dan Moody, Bob Gray, Bruce LeVell, Amy Kremer) to support but not always rah-rah (Karen Handel, Judson Hill) to flat-out defiance (David Abroms). Most of the leading candidates have bounced between those poles depending on the day or the latest controversy. Handel, a favorite of antiabortion activists who has the highest name recognition and once served as Georgia's secretary of state, said in an interview Monday that she is concentrating on doing her "level best to represent the interests of the 6th District" in her positions rather than linking arms with Trump. "Obviously I'm a Republican and support the president," Handel said. "But being in Congress is not the same as being an extension of the White House. I'm more than willing to step up and speak out when the circumstances demand that. ... People want a doer - someone they trust who can move our party from vocal opposition to governing." Endorsements from prominent Republican players have been scattered to the point of muddying the field. Perdue has backed Moody. Gingrich supports Hill, as does Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski endorsed LeVell. Former senator Saxby Chambliss is for Handel. But the conservative Club for Growth has opposed Handel and boosted Gray. To counter the club, the Ending Spending advocacy group, which is backed by the billionaire Ricketts family, has poured millions behind Handel's candidacy. It goes on and on like that further down the line in the state. One group or officeholder goes for Handel, another goes for Gray, another jumps in for Moody or Hill, and Trump supporters of different degrees poke and prod one another on social media. Unsurprisingly, no one has caught fire, and constant squabbling has remained the thrust of the GOP race. As Ossoff's candidacy has exploded on the left - landing on the cover of New York magazine, raising more than $8 million, and attracting the support of actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and bloggers at MoveOn.org and Daily Kos - the Republicans have hovered below 20 percent in most polls. "We've got a shot at an upset," Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., said. "It's like what we're seeing all around, this backlash. The protests, the marches. Democrats want to make a statement." As they did in a special House election last week in Kansas, where Republicans narrowly won a seat that has long been safely GOP, Democrats see, if not a chance at victory, at least a chance to rattle Trump and Republicans as they look toward 2018 and the possibility of winning back the chamber. The surge in early voting here has only raised expectations that Ossoff could hit 50 percent Tuesday or do well in a runoff, which would be held June 20 if needed. Trump signaled in a tweet Monday how Republicans would define Ossoff in a runoff election: "The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!" Ossoff replied in a statement: "While I'm glad the president is interested in the race, he is misinformed." An Emerson College survey released late last week showed Ossoff with 43 percent. Handel garnered 17 percent, Gray -- a former local councilman and businessman -- 15 percent and Moody -- a former state senator -- 9 percent. Hill, another former state senator, was at 6 percent. LeVell, an African American jeweler and former Trump campaign adviser, as well as Trump-aligned conservative activist Kremer, have struggled, perhaps showing the difficulty of being a die-hard Trump supporter in a Republican district that's not dominated by grass-roots nationalism. Abroms, who has campaigned with anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin, has also found it hard to get on the political map. Perdue, who has worked closely with the Trump White House, said he is confident that despite the bloodletting among Republicans, a runoff election would end favorably since this "district is a traditionally 60-40 Republican district, and we really don't want to give a vote to Nancy Pelosi," the House Democratic leader. But Perdue acknowledged that his party is still figuring things out. "It's a democracy," he said wryly of the clashing Republicans. One upside to the fracas, he volunteered, is that "our candidates are not coached like the Democrats."

Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health and human services secretary will be faced with a series of choices over whether to shore up insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act - or let them atrophy. These marketplaces are currently a conduit to health coverage for 10 million Americans, but they have been financially fragile, prompting spiking rates and defections of major insurers. In an interview on Friday with The Washington Post, Trump made his inclinations clear: "The best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode." The president said that the law remains "totally the property of the Democrats" and that "when people get a 200 percent increase next year or a 100 percent or 70 percent, that's their fault." Former Obama administration officials countered that Trump and congressional Republicans are responsible for what happens next. In the seven years since a Democratic Congress passed the law, public sentiment over it has been closely divided. Support has grown slightly in recent months as Republicans tried to begin dismantling it. There are many levers within the ACA that the administration could use to undermine the law or, instead, try to stabilize its marketplaces. In addition, federal rules could be redefined, giving the government's health policies a more conservative twist even with the law still in effect. According to health-care experts from across the ideological spectrum, an imminent question is whether the political tumult surrounding the ACA's fate and the president's talk of explosion could further shake the confidence of consumers and insurers alike. Doing so could prompt exits from the marketplaces. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. Trump's threat could become "a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the last two years of the Obama administration. " That's like inheriting an overseas war, and deciding you let your own soldiers get killed because you didn't elect to enter that war." Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small company covering about a million Americans through the ACA's insurance exchanges, said he is unsure whether it will lessen its participation. Its decision this spring will hinge on actions by the White House and GOP lawmakers, he said. "The ball's sort of in their court. The choices they make are going to determine what happens to the marketplace." The decisions facing the administration are, in essence, a sequel to an executive order the president issued his first night in office, when he directed federal agencies to ease the regulatory burden that the ACA has placed on consumers, the health-care industry and health-care providers. So far, the main action stemming from that directive is a move by the Internal Revenue Service to process Americans' tax refunds even if they fail to submit proof that they are insured, as the ACA requires. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... But there are other steps the administration could take. A major one would be to end cost-sharing subsidies the law provides to lower- and middle-income people with marketplace plans to help pay their deductibles and copays. Those subsidies, which would have been erased by the House Republicans' bill, are the subject of a federal lawsuit. Another question is how the administration will handle the next enrollment season for ACA health plans, which will begin in November. The end of the most recent season coincided with Trump's first days in office, and the new administration yanked some advertising meant to encourage sign-ups - resulting in a small dip in enrollment by the final deadline. And while a set of federal essential health benefits, required of health plans sold to individuals and small businesses, will now remain in law, federal health officials could narrow what they require, limiting prescription drugs, for instance, or the number of visits allowed for mental health treatment or physical therapy. The administration also could take advantage of a part of the ACA that, starting this year, lets health officials give states broad latitude to carry out the law's goals - including more free-market approaches that conservatives favor. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and other top agency officials already have signaled they would allow states to impose work requirements on able-bodied adults to qualify for Medicaid - something Obama officials steadfastly rejected. "The administration could do everything from actively undermining the law to trying to reshape it to moving it in a more conservative direction," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The question of whether the ACA's marketplaces can or should be strengthened is a matter of considerable debate. In comparing the House GOP bill with the ACA, congressional budget analysts concluded this month that the insurance market for people who buy coverage on their own "would probably be stable in most areas" either way. During an afternoon news conference shortly after withdrawing the Republican legislation, Ryan reiterated his oft-stated contention that the marketplaces are beyond repair. He briefly suggested, however, that perhaps the Trump administration could improve their stability. Chip Kahn, president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, said that policymakers must find a way to shore up the marketplaces because a broad swath of Americans rely on them. "There always has been an individual market made up of entrepreneurs who own small businesses, and farmers and ranchers, and it's sort of mandatory that there be policies available to them," Kahn said. House Republicans were notably silent on Friday about the prospects of further work on health policy. A few senators sounded more hopeful that efforts to improve the law would continue. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in an interview that he disagreed with Trump's assertion that letting the markets explode was the best course of action. "I hope that doesn't have to happen," said Cassidy, co-sponsor of a separate bill that would preserve the ACA but tip more latitude to the states. Harvard University economics professor David Cutler, who helped advise the Obama White House on health care, countered Trump's argument that the ACA will always be associated with Democrats. "He owns it now," Cutler said in an email, "because he could take many steps to stabilize things." Carolyn Y. Johnson contributed to this report.

House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for President Donald Trump's agenda, from taxes to infrastructure to the budget. Looming in a few weeks is the need to agree on a bill to keep the government open. After the health care debacle, Trump told Republican leaders he's moving on. The episode is a danger point for the relationship between Trump and Ryan, who had an awkward pairing during the campaign but worked in tandem on the GOP health measure. "I like Speaker Ryan," Trump said. "I think Paul really worked hard." Virtually every congressional Republican won election promising to repeal Obamacare. With a Republican in the White House, passage seemed almost guaranteed. Ryan was steeped in the details, even at one point replicating for a nationwide cable news audience a detailed PowerPoint presentation he delivered to his members. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan addresses the cancellation of a vote Friday on the GOP's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this month, he said flatly, "We'll have 218 (votes) when this thing comes to the floor, I can guarantee you that." Ryan was thrust into the speaker's chair after the stunning 2015 resignation of John Boehner, R-Ohio, and a failed bid by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. At the time, Ryan held his dream job — chairman of the powerful, tax-writing Ways and Means Committee — but took the job as the last viable option to lead a fractured House GOP. While Ryan eased comfortably into the job, he's not the schmoozer Boehner was, a key skill in delivering like-minded but reluctant lawmakers. He lacked the steel and seasoning of Democratic rival Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who delivered Obamacare in the first place — and that took months, not weeks. Even before the bill went down, Pelosi was piling on, taunting Trump and, by implication, Ryan, for rushing the bill to the floor too early. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law.

Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... "You build your consensus in your caucus, and when you're ready, you set the date to bring it to the floor," Pelosi said. "Rookie's error, Donald Trump. You may be a great negotiator. Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready." Ryan entered the health care debate without the experience of having ever managed a situation of such magnitude. "We were a 10-year opposition party where being against things was easy to do," a clearly disappointed Ryan said Friday. "And now, in three months' time, we've tried to go to a governing party, where we have to actually get ... people to agree with each other in how we do things." During former President Barack Obama's tenure, Ryan had always been able to lean on Democrats to pass legislation Obama would sign. On health care, however, Ryan could only count on Republicans, inheriting a fractious group that was schooled in opposing Obama, but lacking in the required team spirit to be a functioning, governing party. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. It's a far different situation facing Ryan than he witnessed when joining the House in 1999. Then, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and legendary Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ran the House with a five-vote majority, instilling a team spirit that is wholly lacking today. Ryan also lacks the tools available to prior leaders, like hometown earmarks. "It's sometimes easier to do things with a smaller majority, because you all realize you've got to stick together or you won't get anything done," said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. "When you get a bigger majority you have factions. And then the challenge is dealing with the different factions." Instead, Ryan struggled — and failed — to thread the needle between conservative hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and moderate lawmakers worried that the GOP measure would harm their constituents — and their political prospects in midterm elections that promise to be bruising for Republicans. While Trump focused on winning over the Freedom Caucus, Ryan failed to keep more pragmatic lawmakers like Rep. David Young, R-Iowa, in line. When Young announced his opposition, a superPAC affiliated with Ryan, the Congressional Leadership Fund, announced it would pull its support from Young. President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan are staring at a moment that could define or derail their tenures, with the vote on the GOP measure to repeal and replace Obamacare approaching and the tally seemingly moving against them.

Ryan are staring at a moment that could define or derail their tenures, with the vote on the GOP measure to repeal and replace Obamacare approaching and the tally seemingly moving against them. The two are not natural allies, something that was clear during... To be sure, several factors conspired against Ryan. Trump sometimes sent mixed signals about how solidly he was behind the effort. The White House is short-handed and its staff is inexperienced in the art of legislating. And Ryan's vote-counting team failed at basic tasks like keeping lawmakers, including the chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., from issuing public statements promising to oppose the bill. "We don't browbeat our folks," said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. "That's why it's harder to keep Republicans in line." Ryan's stature appears secure. And even if Trump and his allies were upset with Ryan, there's no obvious replacement, given the party's short leadership roster. "I don't think this will impact Speaker Ryan because everyone in our conference, whether you're voting yes or no, does know he put his heart and soul into this," said Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump ally. "I am certainly not blaming Paul Ryan in the least." "He's highly respected. He worked very hard on this," said Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa. "He went in for the right reasons."

Republicans survived an embarrassing scare and narrowly held on to a Kansas congressional seat Tuesday in a special election that served as a surprising red-state referendum on President Trump. The single-digit victory for state Treasurer Ron Estes marked a far closer race than Democrats have pulled off in recent years, giving the party bragging rights as it looks to a series of special House elections this year. Estes trailed in early tallies but then began to build a lead over Democratic civil rights attorney James Thompson, who had sought to translate anti-Trump anger on display at rallies and town halls across the country into a victory in one of the nation’s unlikeliest places. The 4th District race in the Wichita area was the first of a series of elections spurred by vacancies created when Republican House incumbents moved to the Trump Cabinet. The Kansas seat was held by Mike Pompeo, who resigned in January to take the job of CIA director. The Kansas seat always ranked as a long shot for the Democrats, since the state has been ruby-red for decades and the seat has been held by a Republican since 1994. Trump carried the district in November in a 60%-33% swamping of Hillary Clinton. Pompeo won with a similar 61% of the vote in November. Both Democrats and Republicans treated a GOP win as a foregone conclusion until recently, when Republicans were shocked into action. The combat continued until election day, when the president tweeted out a request for his supporters to show up at the polls. “Ron Estes is running TODAY for Congress in the Great State of Kansas. A wonderful guy, I need his help on Healthcare & Tax Cuts (Reform),” Trump tweeted. Nearly three months into his presidency, Trump has played the role he did in the campaign: a polarizing figure who inspires both rabid support and angry disapproval. The Kansas race showed that, for the moment, disapproval has more momentum. The period between Trump’s romping November victory and election day Tuesday has been a rocky one for the president. His immigration executive order, one of his campaign’s most vehemently stated promises, was blunted by the courts and prompted protests across the country. More recently, a recalcitrant and ideologically split Republican Congress could not come to agreement over a path to repeal and replace President Obama’s healthcare program, leaving Trump unable to sign any measure to secure another of his highest-profile campaign pledges. The successful ushering in of new Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a clear administration success, has been partly overshadowed by continuing investigations into whether Trump or his team worked with Russian entities to harm Clinton’s presidency, another factor that Democrats hoped would depress Republican enthusiasm. The Kansas race also appeared to be affected by the extreme unpopularity of the state’s Republican governor, Sam Brownback. His tax cuts, to which Estes, as the state Treasurer, was unofficially attached, have left the state with big budget problems. More recently, Brownback vetoed an effort by state legislators, including moderate Republicans, to insure tens of thousands of Kansans by expanding Medicaid under the auspices of Obamacare. A Morning Consult poll released Tuesday listed Brownback as the second-most unpopular governor in the country, with 27% of Kansans approving of him. Only New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was less popular, with 25% support in his state. “Estes appears to be swept up in a last-minute vortex of factors outside his control: Democrats' anger towards Trump, independents' anger towards Gov. Sam Brownback and GOP dissatisfaction with early administration failures,” David Wasserman, an analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, wrote Monday. The outcome of the race had no appreciable impact on control of the House, where Republicans have a comfortable lead over Democrats, 237 to 193. But it was a first test of whether Democrats could translate anti-Trump sentiment into a punitive verdict. Apart from the fact that Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district by nearly 2 to 1, the congressional race represented Kansas’ best-case scenario for Democrats and worst-case for Republicans. Democrat Thompson presented himself as someone who, due to his poverty-filled upbringing, had felt the pain of economically threatened Kansans. That made him the antithesis of a party often defined by coastal elites disconnected from the troubles of middle America. Estes was swept into state office in 2010, along with Brownback, but has not struck an independent posture since and is “largely not known for anything in particular,” said Edward Flentje, professor emeritus at the Wichita State University School of Public Affairs. Estes also seemed not to immediately anticipate the relative strength of the Democratic challenge. “It’s been a lackluster campaign and he’s done a kind of conventional approach to the election,” Flentje said of Estes. Thompson, he said, had gotten his story across “to anybody who pays attention.” The late-campaign push by Republicans included a Monday visit by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, more than $100,000 in money from national Republicans and their allies, and robo-calls into the district from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. The attention was unlike anything seen in the state, where Republicans are usually expected to win as easily as Democrats do in places like California. “All of this is a bit surprising,” Flentje said. “I can’t ever remember getting a robo-call from the president in Kansas.” Nationally, the political focus now turns to next Tuesday’s special election in Georgia, where in a far more centrist district Democrat Jon Ossoff is trying to escape a runoff by gaining a majority against a host of squabbling Republican candidates. That 6th District seat was held until recently by Republican Tom Price, who is now Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services. The district went for Trump in November, but only by single digits, raising Democratic hopes of another boost before the important 2018 elections. With only weeks of planning, Ossoff raised millions in cash at a rate usually accomplished only by veteran fundraisers. cathleen.decker@latimes.com | Twitter: @cathleendecker

In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief." Trump said Obama's law was imploding "and soon will explode." Thwarted by two factions of fellow Republicans, from the center and far right, House Speaker Paul Ryan said President Barack Obama's health care law, the GOP's No. 1 target in the new Trump administration, will remain in place "for the foreseeable future." It was a stunning defeat for the new president after he had demanded House Republicans delay no longer and vote on the legislation Friday, pass or fail. His gamble failed. Instead Trump, who campaigned as a master deal-maker and claimed that he alone could fix the nation's health care system, saw his ultimatum rejected by Republican lawmakers who made clear they answer to their own voters, not to the president. He had "never said repeal and replace it in 64 days," a dejected but still combative Trump said at the White House, though he had repeatedly shouted during the presidential campaign that it was going down "immediately." The bill was withdrawn just minutes before the House vote was to occur, and lawmaker said there were no plans to revisit the issue. Republicans will try to move ahead on other agenda items, including overhauling the tax code, though the failure on the health bill can only make whatever comes next immeasurably harder. Trump pinned the blame on Democrats. "With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there," he told reporters in the Oval Office. "We learned about loyalty, we learned a lot about the vote-getting process." The Obama law was approved in 2010 with no Republican votes. President Donald Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint, since it was a blocked number. Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. "Hello, Bob,"... President Donald Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint, since it was a blocked number. Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. "Hello, Bob,"... Despite reports of backbiting from administration officials toward Ryan, Trump said: "I like Speaker Ryan. ... I think Paul really worked hard." For his part, Ryan told reporters: "We came really close today but we came up short. ... This is a disappointing day for us." He said the president has "really been fantastic." But when asked how Republicans could face voters after their failure to make good on years of promises, Ryan quietly said: "It's a really good question. I wish I had a better answer for you." Last fall, Republicans used the issue to gain and keep control of the White House, Senate and House. During the previous years, they had cast dozens of votes to repeal Obama's law in full or in part, but when they finally got the chance to pass a repeal version that actually had a chance to become law, they couldn't deliver. Democrats could hardly contain their satisfaction. "Today is a great day for our country, what happened on the floor is a victory for the American people," said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who as speaker herself helped Obama pass the Affordable Care Act in the first place. "Let's just for a moment breathe a sigh of relief for the American people." The outcome leaves both Ryan and Trump weakened politically. For the president, this piles a big early congressional defeat onto the continuing inquiries into his presidential campaign's Russia connections and his unfounded wiretapping allegations against Obama. Ryan was not able to corral the House Freedom Caucus, the restive band of conservatives that ousted the previous speaker. Those Republicans wanted the bill to go much further, while some GOP moderates felt it went too far. Instead of picking up support as Friday wore on, the bill went the other direction, with several key lawmakers coming out in opposition. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of a major committee, Appropriations, said the bill would raise costs unacceptably on his constituents. The defections raised the possibility that the bill would not only lose on the floor, but lose big. House Speaker Paul D.

The GOP bill would have eliminated the Obama statute's unpopular fines on people who do not obtain coverage and would also have removed the often-generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance. Republican tax credits would have been based on age, not income like Obama's, and the tax boosts Obama imposed on higher-earning people and health care companies would have been repealed. The bill would have ended Obama's Medicaid expansion and trimmed future federal financing for the federal-state program, letting states impose work requirements on some of the 70 million beneficiaries. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Republican bill would have resulted in 24 million additional uninsured people in a decade and lead to higher out-of-pocket medical costs for many lower-income and people just shy of age 65 when they would become eligible for Medicare. The bill would have blocked federal payments for a year to Planned Parenthood. Republicans had never built a constituency for the legislation, and in the end the nearly uniform opposition from hospitals, doctors, nurses, the AARP, consumer groups and others weighed heavily with many members. On the other side, conservative groups including the Koch outfit argued the legislation did not go far enough in uprooting Obamacare. Ryan made his announcement to lawmakers at a very brief meeting, where he was greeted by a standing ovation in recognition of the support he still enjoys from many lawmakers. When the gathering broke up, Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee that helped write the bill, told reporters: ""We gave it our best shot. That's it. It's done. D-O-N-E done. This bill is dead."

Changes that House Republicans have made to their health-care legislation would reduce savings in federal spending by half as much as their original plan and would still cause 24 million more Americans to be uninsured, according to congressional budget analysts. The estimates by the Congressional Budget Office arrived late Thursday afternoon as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and the Trump administration were scrambling to corral enough support to put the legislation that erases major parts of the Affordable Care Act to a vote. According to the CBO's projections, a set of amendments that House GOP leaders agreed to support Monday night would cut the federal deficit by $150 billion between 2017 and 2026. The original version of the American Health Care Act, as the bill is called, would have curbed the deficit by an estimated $337 billion in that period. The changes would have less impact on savings because they would make it easier for Americans to deduct the cost of medical care from their income taxes and would accelerate by a year the repeal of several taxes that help pay for the ACA, including taxes on insurers, hospitals, high-income adults and tanning beds. Other changes to the bill would increase federal spending for Medicaid, the estimate says, in part by altering payments states receive for their most expensive enrollees - people who are elderly or disabled. The fresh analysis says the amendments would not affect the number of Americans who would be uninsured if the bill were to become law. Compared with the current law, the CBO projects that 14 million more people would be uninsured next year and 24 million more by 2026. Those were the same figures as in its first, much-anticipated report, issued last week, on the House GOP plans. Nor would the amendments make much difference to the typical cost of health plans. For the next two years, insurance premiums for individuals buying coverage on their own would increase by 15 to 20 percent compared with the ACA - only marginally different than the 18 to 20 percent rise predicted for the bill's original version. In 2026, both plan versions would lead to a 10 percent reduction in average premiums, the CBO said. The new forecast does not take into account any of the ideas for tipping federal health-care policy even further in conservative directions - which are being advanced by members of the House Freedom Caucus. The caucus, the chamber's faction on the hard right, is lobbying to eliminate a requirement that insurance plans include 10 basic health benefits in the policies sold to individuals and small businesses. The updated analysis elicited no immediate response from Ryan or the GOP leaders of four House committees that have raced in recent weeks to assemble and approve the legislation. Rep. Steve King, a conservative Republican from Iowa, put the deficit number in a broader context. "None of us that want to save money are happy about the direction that's going," King said, "but as a matter of principle, it's more important that we eliminate mandates than it is that we [save] $200 billion over 10 years." Last week, Ryan talked up the portion of the first CBO analysis that predicted the large reduction in the federal deficit, while White House officials sought to tar the report's accuracy. The Freedom Caucus has complained that the legislation would still devote too much federal money to health spending. Caucus members had not commented Thursday evening on the updated analysis and its finding that adjustments to the bill would leave the deficit in worse condition than the original version. The bill is intended as a first stage in fulfilling Republicans' years-long pledge to unwind the 2010 law adopted by a Democratic Congress - and to replace all but its most popular parts with conservative policies. This stage focuses on the spending parts of the current law because congressional leaders are relying on a budget strategy called "reconciliation." If the House passes the bill, the strategy would allow the Senate to adopt it with a simple majority.

President Donald Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint, since it was a blocked number. Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. "Hello, Bob," Trump began. "So, we just pulled it." Trump was speaking, of course, of the Republican effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, a plan that had been languishing for days amid unrest throughout the party as the president and his allies courted members and pushed for a vote. Before I could ask a question, Trump plunged into his explanation of the politics of deciding to call off a vote on a bill he had been touting. The Democrats, he said, were to blame. "We couldn't get one Democratic vote, and we were a little bit shy, very little, but it was still a little bit shy, so we pulled it," Trump said. Final debate on the American Health Care Act, legislation that aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, began March 24, 2017, but the bill was withdrawn at the last minute ahead of a vote. Trump said he would not put the bill on the floor in the coming weeks. He is willing to wait and watch the current law continue and, in his view, encounter problems. And he believes that Democrats eventually will want to work with him on some kind of legislative fix to Obamacare, although he did not say when that will be. "As you know, I've been saying for years that the best thing is to let Obamacare explode, and then go make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal. And they will come to us; we won't have to come to them," he said. "After Obamacare explodes." "The beauty," Trump continued, "is that they own Obamacare. So when it explodes, they come to us, and we make one beautiful deal for the people." My question for the president: Are you really willing to wait to reengage on health care until the Democrats come and ask for your help? "Sure," Trump said. "I never said I was going to repeal and replace in the first 61 days" - contradicting his own statements and that of his adviser Kellyanne Conway, who told CNN in November that the then-president-elect was contemplating convening a special session on Inauguration Day to begin the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal "Obamacare" off the House floor Friday when it became clear it would fail badly — after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. Democrats said Americans can "breathe a sigh of relief."... Turning to an aide, Trump asked, "How many days is it now? Whatever." He laughed. Trump returned to the theme of blaming the Democrats. "Hey, we could have done this," he said. "But we couldn't get one Democrat vote, not one. So that means they own Obamacare, and when that explodes, they will come to us wanting to save whatever is left, and we'll make a real deal." There is little evidence that either Trump or House Republicans made a serious effort to reach out to Democrats. Still, I wondered, why not whip some more votes this weekend and come back next week to the House with a revised piece of legislation? "Well," Trump said, "we could do that, too. But we didn't do that. It's always possible, but we pulled it." Trump brought up the vote count. "We were close," he said. How close? House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for... House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for... "I would say within anywhere from five to 12 votes," Trump said - although widespread reports indicated that at least three dozen Republicans opposed the measure. That must have hurt after all of his attempts to rally Republicans, I said. He made calls, had people over to the White House, invited House members on Air Force One. He may not have loved the bill, but he embraced the negotiations. "You're right," Trump said. "I'm a team player, but I've also said the best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode." Trump said he made the decision to pull the bill after meeting Friday at the White House with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis. Was that a tense, tough conversation with Ryan, I asked? "No, not tough," Trump said. "It's just life. We had great support among most Republicans but no Democratic votes. Zero. Not one." I mentioned to Trump that some of his allies were frustrated with Ryan. Did he share those frustrations, and would he be able to work with Ryan moving forward on plans to cut taxes and build an infrastructure package? "I don't blame Paul," Trump said. He then repeated the phrase: "I don't blame Paul. He worked very hard on this." And again. "I don't blame Paul at all." As he waits for Democrats, I asked, what's next on health care, if anything, policy-wise? "Time will tell. Obamacare is in for some rough days. You understand that. It's in for some rough, rough days," Trump said. "I'll fix it as it explodes," he said. "They're going to come to ask for help. They're going to have to. Here's the good news: Health care is now totally the property of the Democrats." Speaking of premium increases, Trump said, "When people get a 200 percent increase next year or a 100 percent or 70 percent, that's their fault." He returned again to a partisan line on the turn of events. "To be honest, the biggest losers today are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer," Trump said of the House minority leader and the Senate minority leader. "Because now they own the disaster known as Obamacare." Okay, I asked, they may own it, in his view, but he will at some point be tasked with shaping whatever comes forward as a partial replacement. What will that be? What kind of policy could he support? "Oh, lots of things can happen," Trump said. "But the best would be if we could all get together and do a real health-care bill that would be good for the people, and that could very well happen." Does Trump regret starting his agenda this year with health care? "No, I don't," he said. "But in a way, I'm glad I got it out of the way." "Look, I'm a team player," Trump said of the Republican Party. "I've played this team. I've played with the team. And they just fell a little bit short, and it's very hard when you need almost 100 percent of the votes and we have no votes, zero, from the Democrats. It's unheard of." What happened with the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line conservatives he had wooed over and over again? "Ah, that's the big question," Trump said with a slight chuckle. "Don't know. I have a good relationship with them, but I couldn't get them. They just wouldn't do it." Trump alluded to long-running, simmering dramas on Capitol Hill, which he said had little to do with him, as a reason the Freedom Caucus could not back the bill. "Years of hatred and distrust," he said. "Long before me." Was Trump saying, perhaps, that the inability of Ryan and his team to work well with that caucus was part of why talks stalled? "Well, look, you can say what you want," Trump said. "But there are years of problems, great hatred and distrust, and, you know, I came into the middle of it." "I think they made a mistake, but that's okay," Trump said of the Freedom Caucus. As we wrapped up, I tried to get some clarity. The president was blaming the Democrats and was willing to let the law "explode." Yet he also seemed to be teasing the possibility of doing something bipartisan down the road, a fresh start at some point. I asked, would working on a bipartisan health-care deal a year from now be something he would find more agreeable than whipping the hard right? "A lot of people might say that," Trump said, laughing. "We'll end up with a better health-care plan, a great plan. And you wouldn't need the Freedom Caucus." What about the moderates, the entity known as the Tuesday Group? "They were great," Trump said. "They were really great." He turned once more to the Democrats. "They own it," he said. "You've said that," I told him. "This is a process," Trump concluded, "and it's going to work out very well. I was a team player, and I had an obligation to go along with this." As Trump tried to hang up the phone and get back to work, I asked him to reflect, if at all possible, on lessons learned. He's a few months into his presidency, and he had to pull a bill that he had invested time and energy into passing. What was on his mind? "Just another day," Trump said flatly. "Just another day in paradise, okay?" He paused. "Take care."

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that his health care proposal must change to pass the House, marking a significant retreat from his earlier position that the carefully crafted legislation would fail if altered. The shift came after a private meeting of House Republicans from which Ryan, R-Wis., emerged to tell reporters that his proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act would "incorporate feedback" from the rank-and-file. Ryan attributed the change of strategy to the impact of an analysis issued Monday by the Congressional Budget Office. Among other details that prompted a fresh round of criticism of the proposal was a projection that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured after one year under the Republican plan. Ryan backed away on Wednesday from his previous rhetoric of calling the measure's fate a "binary choice" for Republican lawmakers. "Now that we have our score ... we can make some necessary improvements and refinements to the bill," he said, referring to the CBO's estimate of the impact on the number of those covered by health insurance and what the GOP proposal would cost. Ryan did not detail what changes are under consideration. Vice President Pence also spoke to House Republicans in the meeting, acknowledging that changes to the legislation - which heads to the House Budget Committee for approval Thursday - are in the works. President Trump has offered his support for Ryan's measure, while still meeting with conservative lawmakers who have expressed serious doubts about the plan. "This president is ready to put the full weight of his bully pulpit and all of his tools" behind the bill, Pence told Republicans, according to Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. "It was very important for us to hear that, because there are a lot of people who need that shoring up." A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... A simmering rebellion of conservative populists loyal to President Donald Trump is further endangering the GOP health-care push, with a chorus of influential voices suspicious of the proposal warning the president to abandon it. From headlines at Breitbart to chatter on Fox News Channel and right-wing... Pence told conservatives that the plan was still under negotiation at a private lunch meeting of the Republican Study Committee, a large caucus of conservative House Republicans, according to several attendees. "As he said, it's not often that we get an opportunity to undo such a big piece of legislation that had negative consequences on the American people," said Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., paraphrasing Pence's message. "He's open to make improvements. ... Anything that can get 218 votes and make the bill better, we're all about it." Pence's visit to Capitol Hill - which included meetings with influential blocs of Republicans, as well as individual members - came as part of a White House effort to salvage support for the embattled American Health Care Act, even as President Donald Trump's conservative allies told him the bill could be a political trap. The legislation will face an important test Thursday, when the House Budget Committee meets to consider the legislation and advance it to the House floor. The committee may not directly amend the bill but may make nonbinding recommendations. Any substantive changes would be made by the House Rules Committee, which controls how the bill is presented and debated on the floor. The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... The White House launched an intensive effort Tuesday to salvage support for the Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, even as a growing number of lawmakers weighed in against the proposal. One day after the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis showing that 14 million fewer... House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, R-Tenn., insisted that GOP leaders are not "dug in" when it comes to concerns about the measure. "We're listening; we're definitely listening," she said Wednesday to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. "And I will tell you: Tune in to our Budget Committee tomorrow, and you will hear these conversations." The blitz came two days after the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured next year under the GOP plan. The falling coverage numbers and estimates of higher premiums for older and low-income Americans raised concerns among many lawmakers, particularly those representing states that expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA. Ryan, R-Wis., plans to hold a House floor vote next week, and Trump administration officials have spent the last two days in near-constant discussion with Republican lawmakers as they scramble to find enough votes to pass the measure. Leaders were set to take a preliminary count of members supporting the bill Wednesday night. Critics of the legislation warned Wednesday that the measure remains far short of the 216 votes needed for passage. Typically, 218 votes are needed to pass a bill in the 435-member House, but five pending vacancies have reduced that threshold. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, and with 237 Republicans, party leaders can afford no more than 21 defections. "They will whip it, and they will find 40 nos and another 30 or 40 undecideds," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who has called for changes to mollify conservatives. One member of the Budget Committee who belongs to the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said he will vote against the bill in committee. Two other Freedom Caucus members, as well as three others on the panel, have not said how they will vote. One conservative Budget Committee member who has voiced concerns about the bill said Wednesday that he had been convinced to advance it. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., said he would support the legislation in the panel based on an "implied promise that things are going to be different on the floor, and therefore we can keep the process moving." He declined to say who had made that promise: "People higher up on the food chain than me." "I'll say this, if the bill that comes to the floor is the exact same one in Budget, I'll feel a little bit that I'd been had," he said. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., acknowledged in an MSNBC interview Wednesday that the bill remains under negotiation. "Watching sausage being made is not the prettiest thing," he said. "What can we do on those final pieces that are being negotiated with President Trump and a number of our members in our conference that ultimately want to get to a yes vote and send this bill over to the Senate?" Ryan spent much of Tuesday and Wednesday giving interviews in an attempt to drum up support for the plan. On the Fox Business Network, he defended the plan as a collaboration with Trump and the Senate and said "the major components are staying intact" while opening the door to "refinements and improvements." Later, in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, he countered reports that the White House's support for the bill might be slipping. Ryan said he had spoken to chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump's chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon "a number of times" about the bill, and he noted that Trump had brought lawmakers to the White House multiple times to make the case for the legislation. "We are on the same page as the White House," Ryan said. "I think there are those who would love to wedge us for one reason or another, but that's just not the case." Hours later, at a rally for Obamacare opponents outside the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told activists that the House plan "has a lot of problems" but could possibly be modified into a "real repeal" of the ACA. "I believe we can get it done," Cruz said. "I can tell you, the last week, four days, I've been at the White House meeting with the president, with the vice president, saying, 'We've got to get it done.'" Various changes have been floated since the bill was unveiled earlier this month. Conservatives have pushed for an earlier phase-out of the ACA's Medicaid expansion, moving it from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2018, but GOP moderates in both the House and Senate have pushed back on that notion. "Doing that would be a nonstarter and would be enormously and hugely problematic for many of our members," said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. Meadows said Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus is closely focused on repealing more of the ACA's mandates governing the extent of insurance coverage. "That is probably the No. 1 priority," he said. "If we can get those, it would make the rest of it a whole lot easier." GOP leaders, however, have kept those provisions out of the pending legislation, arguing that their inclusion could threaten the bill's passage in the Senate and that many of those mandates can be undone through Trump administration actions. In another sign of the effect of the CBO report, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., floated a proposal to recalibrate the tax credits established under the House bill to offer more substantial help to low-income Americans. The House bill would offer assistance to individuals making as much as $115,000 a year; Thune's amendment would phase out aid for those making about $75,000 or more. "We want to build on what the House has done, and we think that this amendment does that," Thune said. "It just makes it more defensible both in terms of the policy implications and the politics." The Washington Post's Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder's past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. The collapse of Puzder's nomination threw the White House into further turmoil just two days after the resignation of Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, amid revelations that Flynn had spoken repeatedly, and possibly illegally, with the Russian ambassador last year about lifting U.S. sanctions. Puzder's fate amplified the deteriorating relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill, where bipartisan support grew Wednesday for expanded investigations into ties between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russian officials. The White House, including Trump, offered no comment on Puzder's withdrawal nor any indication of whom the president would nominate in the restaurant executive's place. Puzder issued a statement saying he was "honored" to have been nominated. "While I won't be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team," he said. Oprah Winfrey and her eponymous television network provided senators last month with footage of a 1990 interview with the ex-wife of Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's nominee for labor secretary, in which she discussed allegations of domestic abuse that she has since recanted. The interview... Oprah Winfrey and her eponymous television network provided senators last month with footage of a 1990 interview with the ex-wife of Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's nominee for labor secretary, in which she discussed allegations of domestic abuse that she has since recanted. The interview... A top Trump campaign supporter, Puzder had attracted widespread criticism regarding his business record and personal background. He was set to testify Thursday at a confirmation hearing that had been delayed for weeks to allow for the completion of an ethics review of his vast personal wealth. Critics have railed against Puzder's positions against minimum-wage increases and more generous overtime benefits. Some have also accused him of sexism, pointed to a rancorous divorce that involved later-recanted allegations of domestic abuse as well as racy TV ads run by his restaurant chains that featured scantily clad women eating hamburgers. But it was Puzder's hiring of an undocumented worker for domestic work - as well as his support for more liberalized immigration policies - that pushed several Senate Republicans away, they said. Puzder had told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this month that he had been unaware of the housekeeper's immigration status when he hired her and that he paid federal and state back taxes after terminating her employment. Similar revelations have forced Cabinet nominees to withdraw dating to at least Bill Clinton's presidency, but it was less clear this year, in the unpredictable, rule-breaking era of Trump, whether that norm would apply. In the end, the revelation was particularly troubling to lawmakers because of the job Puzder was seeking: running the Labor Department. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., a member of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday that revelations about Puzder's personal employment practices gave him "serious concerns" that he had conveyed to Senate leaders. Three other GOP senators on the committee, Susan Collins (Maine), Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), had also publicly voiced doubts. In the hours before Puzder withdrew, 12 Republican senators "at a minimum" were withholding support, according to a senior Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid political retribution. The quick erosion of support compelled Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to tell the White House on Wednesday that Puzder lacked the support needed to survive, according to two senior Senate aides who requested anonymity. Shortly after that, Puzder withdrew. Protesters walk to a Hardee's restaurant during a rally against Andrew Puzder's nomination for labor secretary near the Hardee's Headquarters on February 13, 2017 in St Louis, Missouri. The protesters feel that Mr. Puzder will not have the best interest of workers in mind due to his record of being a critic of raising the minimum wage as well as expansion of overtime pay, paid sick leave and the Affordable Care Act.

The protesters feel that Mr. Puzder will not have the best interest of workers in mind due to his record of being a critic of raising the minimum wage as well as expansion of overtime pay, paid sick leave and the Affordable Care Act. Senators may yet face another contentious confirmation vote Thursday, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is scheduled for a final vote on the Senate floor. On Wednesday, Mulvaney lost the backing of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who objects to Mulvaney's support for military spending cuts. Puzder has spent much of his career in the restaurant industry speaking out against wage and labor regulations. The former commercial trial lawyer has been a staunch opponent of rules finalized by the Labor Department last year - and since put on hold - that would have expanded the number of people eligible for overtime pay. He also has been critical of substantially increasing the minimum wage, arguing that it could push companies to cut jobs and encourage businesses to invest more money in automation. As a result, Puzder's nomination immediately came under intense scrutiny from unions, labor groups and consumer advocates who worried the executive would prioritize businesses over workers. As recently as this week, workers from his fast-food chain and advocates for a higher minimum wage marched outside of CKE's restaurants to protest the nomination. Worker advocates had also hand-delivered petitions to senators' local offices and organized trips for CKE employees to travel to Capitol Hill and share their grievances with senators. Democrats cheered Puzder's withdrawal and sought to take credit for helping pressure Republicans to withdraw support. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Puzder's decision "a victory for the American worker. Puzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too." He called on Trump to nominate someone who "champions workers' rights rather than suppresses them." Progressives and Democrats said they hoped Trump's next pick for labor secretary would be someone with a clear willingness to speak up for disadvantaged workers. "We need a labor secretary in the mainstream who supports the workplace protections that he or she would be charged with enforcing - and who cares about workers," said Emily Martin, general counsel for the National Women's Law Center, which opposed Puzder's nomination because of "sexist" advertising run by Carl's Jr. and Hardee's - two of Puzder's restaurant chains - and reports of harassment from employees working for the chain. At least four Republican senators are still on the fence about whether to support Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's choice for labor secretary, putting more pressure on the restaurant executive and political novice to win over members of the president's own party to win confirmation. The... At least four Republican senators are still on the fence about whether to support Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's choice for labor secretary, putting more pressure on the restaurant executive and political novice to win over members of the president's own party to win confirmation. The... Several names that had emerged on Trump's shortlist for labor secretary late last year began recirculating Wednesday. Among them: Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. After Puzder's withdrawal Wednesday, Walker tweeted: "The future is too bright in WI for me to do anything other than being Governor." Puzder would have been the first labor secretary since the Reagan era to take the job without some experience in public service. He made a minor foray into politics in 2011, when he served as an economic adviser and spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who recently endorsed his nomination. In 2016, Puzder was an avid Trump supporter. In addition to serving as an economic adviser to his campaign, he and his wife, Deanna Puzder, contributed a total of $332,000 to Trump's bid, joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. Senators often do not weigh in on a nominee publicly until after a confirmation hearing, but Republicans have been mostly in lockstep to support Trump's top Cabinet nominees. Only one other pick - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson - drew as much public wavering among Republicans before his hearing, when five GOP senators expressed doubts. Ultimately, all of them voted for Tillerson. Beyond the committee where Puzder was scheduled to appear Thursday, three other Republicans - John Thune (S.D.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) - publicly expressed concerns about his nomination. Thune's hesitancy was notable because he is the third-ranking Senate Republican and responsible for helping to build support for big-ticket GOP causes. He told reporters Wednesday that he wanted to know more about why Puzder employed an undocumented housekeeper and how he paid her. Tillis cited the same concerns to reporters. Collins and Murkowski also voted against Betsy DeVos, Trump's choice for education secretary, forcing Vice President Pence to become the first vice president to cast a tiebreaking confirmation vote for a Cabinet member. Both senators are among several who had seen footage of a 1990 "Oprah Winfrey Show" episode in which Puzder's former wife appeared in disguise to describe allegations of domestic violence. The health committee requested that Winfrey's production company provide copies of the episode for senators to review. Puzder has always denied the allegations, and his ex-wife recanted the accusations in 1990 when the couple reached a child-custody agreement at the time of their divorce and again in a letter to senators last month. Aides said before Puzder's withdrawal that Portman was still reviewing his history and did not want to weigh in yet, but the senator represents a state where labor unions were building support against the nomination. Portman won reelection last year with the endorsement of several labor unions, a rare feat these days for a Republican.

Andy Puzder, President Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, admitted to employing a housekeeper who was an immigrant in the U.S. illegally, raising another potential problem for his confirmation amid Democratic criticism of his treatment of workers. “My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few... Another blow to Puzder's chances came on Wednesday morning when the conservative National Review announced its opposition. The publication cited Puzder's past support for increased levels of legal immigration for high-skilled or seasonal workers - a position at odds with Trump's calls for limited legal immigration. The magazine's editors acknowledged "the impulse of the White House and the Senate to try to bulldog through rather than to give obstructionist Democrats a scalp." But, they wrote, "The country, and the administration, can weather a redo on this one." The National Restaurant Association - which had marshaled members across the country to help Puzder - called his withdrawal "extremely unfortunate." "Andy Puzder would have made a great labor secretary," said Cicely Simpson, the group's executive vice president. "We hope that President Trump's next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy."

Republicans eagerly seeking answers from President Trump on how he plans to implement his agenda instead found themselves deflecting new questions Wednesday about the president's latest controversial pronouncements. House and Senate Republicans began the week expecting specific guidance on what will replace the Affordable Care Act, how quickly taxes might get slashed and how the government will pay for a new border wall and infrastructure plan. But on Wednesday, Trump offered up a fresh set of distractions with a flurry of announcements and early-morning tweets. He signed executive orders designed to jump-start construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and withhold federal funds to cities that do not comply with federal immigration laws. Word also came of a White House draft proposal to allow the CIA to reopen secret prisons overseas - and perhaps resume enhanced interrogation techniques. And Trump used Twitter to announce plans "for a major investigation" into his unproven accusations of widespread voter fraud. That left Republicans scrambling with few details and fewer answers at a moment when they had intended to secure the opposite. The first signs of trouble came at midday Wednesday, when Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) faced reporters in a hotel ballroom here at the start of a two-day party strategy session. President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration controls Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall and cut federal grants for immigrant-protecting "sanctuary cities." As early as Thursday, he is expected... President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration controls Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall and cut federal grants for immigrant-protecting "sanctuary cities." As early as Thursday, he is expected... They came prepared to talk about health care and the tax code - but were barraged with questions about Trump's latest moves. On voter fraud, Thune said he had not seen any evidence of widespread problems and declined to directly endorse Trump's investigation. "If they want to take that up, that is a decision that obviously he can make," he said. On the administration's plans to rethink how terrorism detainees are interrogated, Thune was stronger, emphasizing that Congress had settled the issue. "With respect to torture - that's banned," he said, citing a 2015 law that was approved overwhelmingly. Trying to get back on message, Thune added: "What we have to do is focus on the things that unite us," including repealing Obamacare and revamping the tax code. That is exactly what House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to do later in the afternoon. In a private gathering of lawmakers, the two GOP leaders laid out an aggressive legislative agenda calling for Congress to repeal major portions of the ACA, pass replacement measures and embark on a significant tax code overhaul - all within the first 200 days of blanket GOP control in Washington. President Donald Trump's plans to ask for a "major investigation" into allegations of widespread voter fraud were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers - and fear from voting rights advocates that the president will use his unfounded claims to justify more-restrictive... President Donald Trump's plans to ask for a "major investigation" into allegations of widespread voter fraud were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers - and fear from voting rights advocates that the president will use his unfounded claims to justify more-restrictive... What they didn't do is fully explain how these goals will be achieved - which is what most Republican lawmakers traveled to Philadelphia to learn. Interviews with more than a dozen GOP lawmakers, in fact, revealed a clash of expectations between rank-and-file lawmakers to get started in disassembling Obamacare and party leaders who are all too aware of the obstacles and difficult choices ahead. "Exact, specific and detailed - that's what people want," said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Rules Committee. "We're going to own this stuff, and we better be able to explain it." "I don't think you will see a plan," said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of a key subcommittee on health-care. "I think you will see components of a plan that are part of different pieces of legislation that will make up what will ultimately be the plan." In the private session, Ryan and McConnell declared repealing and replacing Obamacare their first order of business, with a target date for action within the next three months. The lawmakers also said they plan to move quickly on a broad tax code rewrite that is expected to include deep rate cuts while maintaining current revenues through reforms to the international tax code, according to multiple lawmakers in the room who requested anonymity to describe the meeting. The leaders laid out a three-pronged plan to undermine Obamacare with a combination of new legislation, executive action by Trump and regulatory changes within his administration. They said a replacement law would require some Democratic support. Tax reform would follow on an ambitious schedule, members who attended the briefing said, with an eye toward passing that overhaul, at least in the House, before Congress breaks for its summer recess in August. Ryan told members that they would work toward a tax reform plan that would cut rates while roughly maintaining current revenue levels. "He laid out a very ambitious agenda," said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). "We're on an aggressive time table, it was almost like a construction chart the way he laid it out." Additionally, a senior House appropriator, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), announced plans to pass a special appropriations bill funding a Mexican border wall in the spring and to undo several major Obama era regulations in the meantime. Also on the agenda: Drafting the first all-Republican budget in a decade with the goal of fund the government and avoiding a debt-ceiling crisis. One point of tension between Trump and lawmakers was on an infrastructure bill. Leaders told the crowd that the initial draft of their legislative agenda did not include any measure to boost transportation projects, but Trump himself had insisted on it. No details, such as a price tag or structure, were discussed, multiple members said. "Without the president's input, that would not have been the case," said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who advised the Trump transition. Trump is scheduled to address the gathering on Thursday, where he is expected to sketch out his legislative agenda for the coming months. Paying for Trump's proposals remains an unexplored subject. Many hard-line conservatives previously opposed large policy changes that would add greatly to the deficit, as many of Trump's proposals could. Trump has said he doesn't want to touch popular entitlement programs, but Hill Republicans - including Ryan and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the president's nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services - have left the door open. One question among House Republicans is how many of the recommendations within the official House GOP policy blueprint, "A Better Way," Trump will also take up. Also unclear is how much leverage these Republican lawmakers will have to negotiate with a president who does not like dissent and regularly takes to cable news and Twitter to lash out at critics. "He's only been there a couple of days, I get it, but we do need to know this: Is he going to be with us when we go forward? Where does he stand on these issues?" said Rep. Roger Williams (R-Tex.). "There's a lot of questions we need to ask him so we know where he is, so we don't go out down the dirt road and he's going on down the freeway." Collins cautioned that Trump may not linger in Philadelphia and did not expect any significant progress on policy. "I wouldn't expect any nitty-gritty," he said. "It'll be top-line. He'll say he's working closely with Pence and the leadership." But Collins acknowledged that any hints will be taken as directives by members who are eager for guidance from the president: "The more specific the president and his administration can be, it's safe to say that becomes the template." Amid Trump's early moves as president, Ryan and McConnell have taken pains to present a unified front on major policy issues, and their retreat will undoubtedly offer moments of comity - including an address from British Prime Minister Theresa May and a visit from former National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning. Numerous lawmakers expressed faith that Trump's bluster could be translated into the familiar language of Republican policy - and almost all cited Pence, a former member of the House GOP leadership who will also attend the retreat Thursday, as a crucial emissary in bridging that divide. "It very much appears to me, particularly given that Mike Pence comes from the House, that we will have the central role as we ought to as the legislative body in driving legislation," said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). "They need us." Tiberi was more blunt about his views on bridging the divide. "I've watched this guy for two years," he told a small group of reporters. "You guys take him literally and nobody else does. You'll learn eventually not to take him literally." O'Keefe reported from Washington. Robert Costa and Lisa Rein in Washington and Sean Sullivan in Philadelphia contributed to this report.

Republicans roundly scolded their own presidential candidate Monday, demanding Donald Trump apologize for — and just stop — talking about the ethnic background and impartiality of the American judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Leading the roll call were two former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. Ohio Gov. John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive against the impartiality of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel "is flat-out wrong." Trump, Kasich wrote, should "apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country." Chimed in Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, "It's wrong and I hope he stops." Other prominent Republicans piled on, drawing a solid line between themselves and the billionaire candidate with whom they've developed a fragile peace. But that detente comes with caveats — chief of which is the understanding that Trump, nomination nearly in hand, will now focus on uniting the fractured GOP. Trump, too, showed some deference for the truce, declining to immediately hit back at the Republican lawmakers who have demanded he change focus. Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., stuck up for Trump somewhat on CNN, insisting "Donald Trump is not a racist" but acknowledging "It's time to just let go of this ... and move on." The Senate's top Republican says he "couldn't disagree more" with Donald Trump's personal attacks on the federal judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is disavowing Trump's claim that Judge Gonzalo Curiel can't be impartial in the case.... The Senate's top Republican says he "couldn't disagree more" with Donald Trump's personal attacks on the federal judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is disavowing Trump's claim that Judge Gonzalo Curiel can't be impartial in the case.... No mea culpa seemed forthcoming from the billionaire candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that his criticism of Curiel came in defense against relentless questions from reporters and others about lawsuits against Trump University. Trump said Curiel can't be impartial in the suits because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the border. Last week, he denied on CNN that his remarks are racist. "Public Service Announcement: Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism,'" tweeted Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a longtime Trump critic. Curiel is a former federal prosecutor who was born in Indiana to parents who came from Mexico in the 1940s. He has not responded to Trump's attack, and Trump's legal team has not sought his removal from the case. Judges generally are thought to have conflicts of interest only in more specific situations, such as a financial interest in the outcome of the case. Donald Trump said that the federal judge presiding over a lawsuit brought by former Trump University students has an "absolute conflict" in handling the case because he is "of Mexican heritage." The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told The Wall Street Journal, in an interview in Friday's... Donald Trump said that the federal judge presiding over a lawsuit brought by former Trump University students has an "absolute conflict" in handling the case because he is "of Mexican heritage." The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told The Wall Street Journal, in an interview in Friday's... Trump University is the target of two lawsuits — in San Diego and New York — which accuse the business of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach them secrets of success in real estate. Trump has maintained that customers were overwhelmingly satisfied. Curiel is presiding over the suits in California. "All I'm trying to do is figure out why I'm being treated so unfairly by a judge," Trump said Monday on Fox News Channel. The Republican establishment responded in rare unison: Just stop. "He needs to stop saying it. That man is an American — born in the United States," Rubio, son of Cuban immigrants, told Orlando television station WFTV. "I don't think it reflects well on the Republican Party. I don't think it reflects well on us as a nation." Added Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine: "Donald Trump's comments on the ethnic heritage and religion of judges are absolutely unacceptable. His statement that Judge Curiel could not rule fairly because of his Mexican heritage does not represent our American values." South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of the Senate GOP leadership, said: "Yeah, he's going to have to adapt. This is not working for him. They were inappropriate comments." Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who is in a competitive re-election race, emphasized that he's running "a very independent campaign" from Trump's. "To suggest somebody is not capable of doing a job because of their ancestry is wrong and unacceptable," said Portman. Said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, "I'm not going to be sucked into talking about Trump 24/7." The cascade of condemnation began on the Sunday talk shows, when a trio of prominent Republicans firmly rejected Trump's focus on Curiel and urged him to make good on his promise to unite the fractured Republican Party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he "couldn't disagree more" with Trump's statements about Curiel's impartiality, adding that "we're all behind him now" — an implicit warning that such unity might not be the case for long. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he doesn't condone Trump's statements about Curiel, then complained that his interview was supposed to be about foreign policy. And former House speaker Newt Gingrich pointedly suggested that Trump start acting like "a potential leader of the United States." Trump already has rejected calls for him to adjust his approach. "I'm not changing," he said Tuesday at a fiery news conference at Trump Tower. On Sunday, Trump doubled down on the idea. Asked on CBS whether a Muslim judge would be unfair given Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., Trump responded: "Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely." That puts Trump in significant conflict with the Republicans he hopes to lead — including many of the ones who have opted to support him. Associated Press

President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration controls Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall and cut federal grants for immigrant-protecting "sanctuary cities." As early as Thursday, he is expected to pause the flow of all refugees to the U.S. and indefinitely bar those fleeing war-torn Syria. "Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders," Trump declared during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security. "We are going to save lives on both sides of the border. The actions, less than a week into Trump's presidency, fulfilled pledges that animated his candidacy and represented a dramatic redirection of U.S. immigration policy. They were cheered by Republicans allies in Congress, condemned by immigration advocates and triggered immediate new tension with the Mexican government. "I regret and reject the decision of the U.S. to build the wall," Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said Wednesday in a nationally televised address. Trump is expected to wield his executive power again later this week with the directive to dam the refugee flow into the U.S. for at least four months, in addition to the open-ended pause on Syrian arrivals. The president's upcoming order is also expected to suspend issuing visas for people from several predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — for at least 30 days, according to a draft executive order obtained by The Associated Press. Trump is unveiling his immigration plans at a time when detentions at the nation's southern border are down significantly from levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The arrest tally last year was the fifth-lowest since 1972. Deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally also increased under President Barack Obama, though Republicans criticized him for setting prosecution guidelines that spared some groups from the threat of deportation, including those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. As a candidate, Trump tapped into the immigration concerns of some Americans who worry both about a loss of economic opportunities and the threat of criminals and terrorists entering the country. His call for a border wall was among his most popular proposals with supporters, who often broke out in chants of "build that wall" during rallies. Immigration advocates and others assailed the new president's actions. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said the president's desire to construct a border wall was "driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces America's proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants." How Trump plans to pay for the wall project is murky. While he has repeatedly promised that Mexico will foot the bill, U.S. taxpayers are expected to cover the initial costs and the new administration has said nothing about how it might compel Mexico to reimburse the money. In an interview with ABC News earlier Wednesday, Trump said, "There will be a payment; it will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form." Pena Nieto said Wednesday, "I have said time and again, Mexico will not pay for any wall." He has been expected to meet with Trump at the White House next week, although a senior official said Trump's announcement had led him to reconsider the visit. Congressional aides say there is about $100 million of unspent appropriations in the Department of Homeland Security account for border security, fencing and infrastructure. That would allow planning efforts to get started, but far more money would have to be appropriated for construction to begin. House Speaker Paul Ryan, in an interview Wednesday on MSNBC, said Congress will work with Trump on the upfront financing for the wall. Asked about estimates that the project could cost $8 billion to $14 billion, Ryan said, "That's about right." Trump has insisted many times the border structure will be a wall. The order he signed referred to "a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous and impassable physical barrier." To build the wall, the president is relying on a 2006 law that authorized several hundred miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile frontier. That bill led to the construction of about 700 miles of various kinds of fencing designed to block both vehicles and pedestrians. President Donald Trump declared Wednesday he believes torture works as his administration readied a sweeping review of how America conducts the war on terror. It includes possible resumption of banned interrogation methods and reopening CIA-run "black site" prisons outside the United States. In... President Donald Trump declared Wednesday he believes torture works as his administration readied a sweeping review of how America conducts the war on terror. It includes possible resumption of banned interrogation methods and reopening CIA-run "black site" prisons outside the United States. In... The president's orders also call for hiring 5,000 additional border patrol agents and 10,000 more immigration officers, though the increases are subject to the approval of congressional funding. He also moved to end what Republicans have labeled a catch-and-release system at the border. Currently, some immigrants caught crossing the border illegally are released and given notices to report back to immigration officials at a later date. Trump's crackdown on sanctuary cities — locales that don't cooperate with immigration authorities — could cost individual jurisdictions millions of dollars. But the administration may face legal challenges, given that some federal courts have found that cities or counties cannot hold immigrants beyond their jail terms or deny them bond based only a request from immigration authorities. Some of the nation's largest metropolitan areas — including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — are considered sanctuary cities. The president also moved to restart the "Secure Communities" program, which was launched under President George W. Bush and initially touted as a way for immigration authorities to quickly and easily identify people in the country illegally who had been arrested by local authorities. The program helped the Obama administration deport a record high of more than 409,000 immigrants in 2012. But Obama eventually abandoned the program after immigration advocates and civil libertarians decried it as too often targeting immigrants charged with low-level crimes, including traffic violations. Among those in the audience for Trump's remarks at DHS were the families of people killed by people in the U.S. illegally. After reading the names of those killed, Trump said, "Your children will not have lost their lives for no reason." Trump's actions on halting all refugees could be announced as soon as Thursday. Administration officials and others briefed on the plans cautioned that some details of the measures could still be changed, but indicated that Trump planned to follow through on his campaign promises to limit access to the U.S. for people coming from countries with terrorism ties.

President Donald Trump's plans to ask for a "major investigation" into allegations of widespread voter fraud were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers - and fear from voting rights advocates that the president will use his unfounded claims to justify more-restrictive voting laws. It is unclear who will investigate Trump's belief that he lost the popular vote in November's election because millions of illegal votes were cast. The president could set up an independent commission or task force to look into the claims, which have already been disproved by many national studies. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president's investigation would examine "the integrity of our voting system" and not just the 2016 election. The Justice Department, which investigates claims of election crimes, has not historically launched a criminal investigation at the request of a president. An attorney general could order an investigation, but Trump's nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has not yet been confirmed, and his spokeswoman declined to comment. Justice officials said they knew nothing about an investigation into voter fraud and referred questions to the White House. Former assistant attorney general for civil rights Tom Perez, who oversaw the department's voting section under former President Barack Obama's administration, called Trump's announcement of a voter fraud probe "a totally stupid and wasteful investigation into nonexistent problems." Update: The Post's Matea Gold has now confirmed that Trump's daughter, Tiffany Trump, is also registered to vote in two states - New York and Pennsylvania. And Trump's Treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin is as well. President Donald Trump says he will launch an investigation into his baseless...

And Trump's Treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin is as well. President Donald Trump says he will launch an investigation into his baseless... "I can't think of a more colossal waste of taxpayer dollars than to initiate this investigation," said Perez, who was also labor secretary and is now a candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee. "This is all about ego. The issue of in-person voting fraud is virtually nonexistent." In back-to-back tweets on Wednesday, Trump said the investigation would cover "those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal" and "those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time)." News outlets reported Wednesday that Trump's daughter Tiffany, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin were all registered to vote in two states. "Depending on results," Trump added in his tweet, "we will strengthen up voting procedures." Former Justice spokesman Matthew Miller said this is exactly the fear of voting rights advocates - that such an investigation will be used to endorse more-restrictive voting laws. "That's where this is going," Miller said. What does a decorated German golfer have to do with a "major investigation" into voter fraud sought by the U.S. president? Much more than one might expect. On Wednesday, the New York Times published a story about President Donald Trump's remarks at a bipartisan luncheon held Monday. He repeated... What does a decorated German golfer have to do with a "major investigation" into voter fraud sought by the U.S. president? Much more than one might expect. On Wednesday, the New York Times published a story about President Donald Trump's remarks at a bipartisan luncheon held Monday. He repeated... Civil rights groups are specifically worried about an action the Justice Department took three hours after Trump's inauguration on one of the most controversial voting laws in the country - a 2011 voter ID law in Texas, which every judge who has considered it has found to be discriminatory. On Friday, Justice officials asked for a months-long delay in a hearing in the case so they can determine their next course of action, which could include dropping out of the case altogether. Trump called for the voter fraud investigation after insisting during a private reception with congressional leaders on Monday that there were between 3 million and 5 million ballots illegally cast in the election, allowing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to win the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes. Clinton ultimately lost the electoral college vote to Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he has "seen no evidence" to that effect, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that the president's allegations were undermining faith in the democratic system. "I would urge the president to knock this off," Graham said. "This is the greatest democracy on Earth. We're the leader of the free world. And people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification." Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said, "I don't see the evidence [of fraud], but he's the president, and if he thinks it's there, have at it." Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Trump's claim "absolute nonsense," and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she could not understand why the newly installed president is "so insecure." The White House on Tuesday stuck firmly to President Donald Trump's claim that millions of people voted illegally in the November election, but provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the president "does believe" that he lost the popular vote to Democrat ... The White House on Tuesday stuck firmly to President Donald Trump's claim that millions of people voted illegally in the November election, but provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the president "does believe" that he lost the popular vote to Democrat ... Pelosi called Trump's focus on voter fraud "really strange" - especially because his own lawyers disputed allegations of ballot irregularities when Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein challenged the results in some states last fall. "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake," Trump's lawyers stated in a recent court filing in that case. "I frankly feel very sad for the president making this claim," Pelosi added. "I felt sorry for him. I even prayed for him - but then I prayed for the United States of America." The organization that represents secretaries of state who run local elections said it is "not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump." Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted questioned the need for a voter fraud investigation, saying that Ohio conducted a review four years ago and has another review of the 2016 election underway. "Easy to vote, hard to cheat," Husted tweeted. The president and his aides have yet to provide any verifiable facts to back up his claim, and analyses of the election found virtually no confirmed cases of voter fraud, let alone millions. While there have always been some isolated instances of alleged voter fraud, voting experts say there is no evidence of widespread fraud that affects elections. "I think taking the necessary steps to study and to track what we can do to both understand this, the scope of the problem, and then, secondly, how to stop the problem going forward is something that's definitely, clearly in the best interest," Spicer said. Spicer cited research that he said backs up Trump's claims. But Spicer cited a Pew study that does not support this claim. He also conflated the Pew study with another study that also does not support the voter fraud claim. Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there's no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of in-person voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples. There... Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there's no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of in-person voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples. There... A 2012 Pew Center on the States study found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state, which can happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without notifying the other state, and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls. The primary author of the Pew report tweeted in response to the Trump staff's claim that he "can confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud." Spicer also referenced a Pew study from 2008 showing that "14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens." Research by Old Dominion University professors - not Pew - using data from 2008 and 2010 found that 14 percent of noncitizens in the samples said they were registered to vote. But the researchers warned that "it is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens." One of the researchers, Jesse Richman, wrote about the Trump staff's use of his research. The results "suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions," he wrote. Perez suggested that before Trump launches his investigation, "he might want to talk to the governor of Texas," where a task force studying voter fraud found none, Perez said. Perez said that in the Texas voter ID lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, the state acknowledged a voter fraud task force finding that over a 10-year period, 46 million people voted in the state and there were no instances of illegal voting by noncitizens. There were only two instances of in-person voter fraud, he said. The Washington Post's Matt Zapotosky and Michelle Ye Hee Lee.

When Donald Trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower, he declared that it would be unlike any of his other ventures. Trump University would be a noble endeavor, he said, with an emphasis on education over profits. It was a way for him to give back, to share his expertise with the masses, to build a "legacy as an educator." He wouldn't even keep all the money - if he happened to make a profit, he would turn the funds over to charity. "If I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge, I think I'd be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money," Trump told the inaugural news conference in the spring of 2005. The launch of Trump University coincided with two auspicious developments for the real estate mogul: Through his then year-old hit TV show "The Apprentice," the billionaire was developing an image as America's savviest boss, while the nation's booming real estate market was giving hope to many who dreamed of striking it rich. Ads touted Trump University as "the next best thing to being Trump's apprentice." Trump, who every week on TV singled out someone to be fired, pledged in a promotional video to "hand-pick" instructors. "Priceless information" would help attendees build wealth in the same real estate game that made Trump rich. In the end, few if any of these statements would prove to be true. Trump University was not a university. It was not even a school. Rather, it was a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country that promised attendees they could get rich quick but were mostly devoted to enriching the people who ran them. Participants were enticed with local newspaper ads featuring images of Trump, then encouraged to write checks or charge tens of thousands of dollars on credit cards for multi-day learning sessions. Participants were considered "buyers," as one internal document put it. According to the company's former president, Trump did not personally pick the instructors. Many attendees were trained by people with little or no real estate expertise, customers and former employees have alleged in lawsuits against the company. "I was told to do one thing," said James Harris, a Trump University instructor whose sessions have been repeatedly cited in the litigation, in an interview with The Washington Post. "And that one thing was ... to show up to teach, train and motivate people to purchase the Trump University products and services and make sure everybody bought. That is it." A Trump spokesman said Harris's comments "have no merit" and accused Harris of "looking for media attention to further his own agenda." All told, Trump University received about $40 million in revenue from more than 5,000 participants before it halted operations in 2010 amid lawsuits in New York and California alleging widespread fraud. The New York attorney general estimated Trump netted more than $5 million during the five years it was active. He has since acknowledged that he gave none of the profits to charity. This account is based on a review of hundreds of pages of internal company records that have become public as a result of the lawsuits, as well as new interviews with former Trump University employees and customers. Many of the company's internal records, including several "playbooks" that advised employees on strategies for pressuring customers, were unsealed in court over the past week in response to a request by The Post. Trump and his lawyers have vigorously disputed the allegations, predicting they will win in court and reopen the business. They point to positive customer-satisfaction surveys that have been submitted in the lawsuits and suggest they have been unfairly targeted by trial lawyers and a politically motivated attorney general in New York. "We continue to believe that people got substantial value and that people were overwhelmingly satisfied," said Trump's general counsel, Alan Garten. "We are not going to be stopping what we are doing. We are going to continue to zealously defend this case because, at the end of the day, we know we are not being tried by The Washington Post or by CNN - but in a court room by a jury." Garten acknowledged that Trump never gave away the profits to charity. He said it was always Trump's intention, but that the lawyers leading the class-action suits against the company "got a hold of this and ... whatever profits existed sort of evaporated." The unfulfilled promise was first reported last year by Time magazine. In his defense, Trump has often cited the many positive reviews by former customers. A number of them submitted sworn statements in court explaining their positive experiences at Trump University. Former students of Trump University share their positive experiences studying at the school. Former students of Trump University share their positive experiences studying at the school. Kissy and Mark Gordon, who own a residential development company in Virginia and jointly signed up for the most expensive program in 2008, said in an interview that they still use techniques they learned from the course today. "Did we have an expectation that Trump was going to teach us? No," Kissy Gordon said. "We have a building background and the economy changed, and we were looking for something in the same field to do something with it. So we were there to learn." Gregory Leishman, another former customer, recalled speaking to his assigned Trump University mentor on the phone weekly and touring potential properties for purchase with him in New Haven, Connecticut. "They gave me information I didn't have otherwise," he said. "You can probably get all that information from reading books. But Trump University was a crash course. You pay more, you get more." Nonetheless, the company has emerged as one of the most potent lines of attack against Trump's campaign for president. In the Republican primary, Sen. Marco Rubio (Florida) cited it as a "fake university" and sought to use it to help build a case that Trump was a "con artist." In recent days, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her campaign have picked up on that theme. "Trump U is devastating because its a metaphor for his whole campaign: promising hard working Americans a way to get a head all based on lies," tweeted press secretary Brian Fallon. Trump also last week invited a torrent of criticism, including from legal scholars on the left and right, for accusing the judge presiding over the California suits, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased because he is of Mexican descent. Trump has said that Curiel is "Mexican," although the 62-year-old was born in Indiana, and that because Trump wants to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border the judge cannot properly do his job. The focus on Trump University also reignited a controversy in Texas over the decision there by the state attorney general not to file a fraud case against the business. Newly disclosed documents reported by Texas media show that investigators had probed the company for seven months and recommended a lawsuit. The inquiry was shut down when Trump University closed up shop in the state. Trump later gave $35,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of then-Attorney General Greg Abbott. A spokesman for Abbott, now the Republican governor of Texas, has said it's "absurd" to suggest a connection between the case and the donation that came several years later and that Trump University was "forced out of Texas and consumers were protected." Garten also dismissed any connection between the Texas decision and Trump's donation, saying investigators reviewed "a few complaints ... and decided not to proceed." "Ready to sell, sell, sell" The Trump University sales pitch began at free seminars, such as one hosted at a Holiday Inn just outside of Washington in 2009. A placard outside the ballroom read, "Trump, think BIG." Inside, aspiring real estate investors heard the theme song from "The Apprentice," the O'Jays classic, "For the Love of Money." Then, a Trump University instructor took the microphone. "All right, you guys ready to be the next Trump real estate millionaire? Yes or No!?" he yelled, according to a Post account at the time. The purpose of these free 90-minute introductions was not to turn attendees into millionaires, but rather to "set the hook" for future sales, according to employee playbooks. The playbooks directed leaders of the free seminars to conclude introductory events by getting "in the sales mindset," "ready to sell, sell, sell!"

Three-day courses typically cost $1,495, the records show. But people who paid to attend them were then urged to sign up for even pricier "elite" programs. A "workshop enrollment form" distributed to participants laid out the options in categories, starting with the "Trump Gold Elite" program. At $34,995, it was the most expensive option - providing three days of personal, in-the-field mentorship as well as special programs on real estate investment, "wealth preservation" and "creative financing." The "Trump Silver Elite" package, priced at $19,495, offered real estate and finance training. The "Trump Bronze Elite," priced at $9,995, offered similar, but fewer, courses. Employees distributed "profile" surveys on the first day of the seminars, in which participants would outline their financial goals, as well as current assets and liabilities. Attendees were told that the information would help them figure out how much they had to invest in real estate, according to customer complaints. But in the evenings, after seminars had concluded for the first day, staff members were instructed to use the information to rank each participant according to assets they had available to spend on more Trump University programs. "If they can afford the gold elite," the playbook advised, "don't allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite." A 43-page "sales playbook" offered guidance on using psychological tools to convince students that they needed to sign up for the classes to fulfill their own goals - overcoming their worries that they might not need or be able to afford the classes. "Customers don't have needs - they have problems," the book advised. "Problems are like health. The more a problem hurts now, the more the need for a solution now. And the more it hurts, the more they'll be prepared to pay for a speedy solution." In a section devoted to "negotiating student resistance," sales people were offered sample responses to common objections from potential students. If a potential customer said he was concerned about going into debt to pay for the classes, staff were advised to needle them: "I see, do you like living paycheck to paycheck?" If doubts persisted, staffers were advised to invoke the big boss himself. "Mr. Trump won't listen to excuses and neither will we," the instructors were told to say. Former students have said they were instructed to call their credit card companies on the spot and raise their borrowing limit to pay for the program. Harris, the former instructor, recalled one of his typical pitches to urge customers to find money for programs: "Do you have any equity on your home? Do you have a 401(k) or IRA?" Harris, 47, said he was one of Trump University's biggest sellers. Garten, Trump's lawyer, said Harris was one of the most highly rated instructors. Instructors had to sell hard to turn participants at free seminars into paying customers. For the four years Trump University operated, more than 80,300 people attended the free introductory sessions. Those previews were offered 2,000 times in nearly 700 locations around the country. But only around 6,000 people paid between $995 and $1,995 to attend three-day seminars, director of operations Mark Covais said in a 2012 affidavit. According to Covais, 572 people paid the full $34,995 for the top-level Trump University mentorship. "Donald Trump personally picked me" The entire program was built around Trump - his picture, his quotes and the promise of obtaining access to his special formula for prosperity. One ad for the free Trump University seminars that appeared in a Corpus Christi, Texas, newspaper in 2009 promised attendees that they would "Learn from the Master," below a picture of Trump. "I can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor," read a quote on the ad, attributed to Trump. The California class-action lawsuit contains 49 separate instances of Trump University attendees being told their instructor or future mentor was personally chosen by Trump in 2009 alone. "Donald Trump personally picked me," one instructor told a group at a free seminar in May 2009, according to a transcript of the session filed as part of the New York case. "He could have picked anybody in this world but he picked me and the reason he picked me is because I've been very, very successful helping average people make a lot of money." Harris, the former instructor, told an introductory meeting of potential customers in 2009 that Trump's personal generosity was a core element of the program. "He did not have to start this university," Harris told the group, according to a transcript in the New York case. "He does not need the money. . . . He does not get a dime of it. Does everyone understand this? Please say 'yes.' He does not need the money." In one presentation cited in the New York lawsuit, Harris described Trump as instrumental to his own efforts to turn his life around just after high school. "I lived on the streets of New York, mostly down in the subways for the first nine months, and I did a lot of things to make some money," he told a group attending a 2008 event. "And then I met a gentleman and he took me in, and I lived with him for a year and he taught me how to do real estate. He is still my mentor today. So the reason I am here is because Donald Trump picked me." In an interview, Harris said he met Trump once in the early 1990s, backstage at an event at the Taj Mahal casino. "Here is the truth," he said. "When I was at Trump University, I had not one interaction with him ever. Not one." In reality, the instructors were not close to Trump, and many were not experts in real estate, according to several ex-staffers who have testified in the lawsuits. "The Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke," said Jason Nicholas, who worked for the company for seven months in 2007 and submitted a statement in the lawsuit. "In my opinion, it was just selling false hopes and lies." Michael Sexton, who was president of Trump University, acknowledged in sworn testimony in the New York case that none of the event instructors were hand-picked by Trump. Trump told lawyers in California that he would not dispute Sexton's statement - nor could he remember a series of instructors, including Harris, by name or face. Trump also did not review course curriculum, Sexton said. "He would never do that," Sexton said. "Mr. Trump is not going to go through a 300-page, you know, binder of content." Only when it came to marketing material was Trump deeply involved, reviewing every piece of advertisement, Sexton testified. "Mr. Trump understandably is protective of his brand and very protective of his image and how he's portrayed," Sexton said. "And he wanted to see how his brand and image were portrayed in Trump University marketing materials. And he had very good and substantive input as well." Garten, the Trump attorney, said Trump was engaged as any CEO would be in the operations. Outside experts designed the curriculum, Garten said, but Trump was "intimately involved" in the process. While Trump may not have selected every instructor, Garten said he was "very much involved in the process and the discussion of what type of instructor was desired." "Other people's money" At the courses, students were supposed to learn Trump's secrets of real estate success. But in sworn testimony in New York, Sexton could recall only one Trump practice that was incorporated into the courses: Invest in foreclosed properties. The lesson underscored how Trump University, which was formed to teach aspiring business people to profit from the fast-expanding housing market, tailored itself after the 2008 economic crash to offer guidance on profiting from the aftermath. One ad placed in the San Antonio Express-News in October 2009 promised that seminars would allow participants to "learn from Donald Trump's handpicked experts how you can profit from the largest real estate liquidation in history." At a seminar called "Fast Track to Foreclosure," students were instructed to find OPM, "other people's money," to buy homes out of foreclosure at depressed prices, dress them up with new paint and attractive landscaping - then flip them for profit. Attendees were advised to use credit cards to invest in real estate, and they were told how to persuade credit card companies to raise their credit limits. If a credit card company representative asked for their income, they were advised to add $75,000 in anticipated earnings from their real estate venture before providing a figure for their expected earnings for the year. Some customers have also alleged they were told there would be a personal appearance at the session by Trump. Instead, they received the opportunity to get their photograph taken with a life-size cardboard cutout of the mogul. John Brown, a customer who provided a sworn statement in the New York case, described how he "came to realize that I was not adequately trained, which caused me to feel that Trump University had taken advantage of me." Brown said he paid $1,495 for a three-day seminar in 2009 and then used multiple credit cards to charge a $24,995 Trump mentorship program. Three years later, he said he had made no real estate investments using Trump knowledge - but was still paying off $20,000 from the courses. "Because of the Trump name," he said, "I felt these classes would be the best." The Washington Post's Alice Crites contributed to this report.

Trump University gave employees detailed instructions on how to entice people to enroll in its real estate seminars, from targeting people making at least $90,000 a year and choosing words of flattery that are most persuasive to picking music for the gatherings — The O'Jays' "For the Love of Money. The "playbooks" for the now-defunct business owned by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, were unsealed Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit by customers who say they were defrauded. Last Friday, a judge who has earned Trump's scorn sided with attorneys for The Washington Post who argued that the public had a right to know what was previously confidential. The documents outline how employees should guide customers through "the roller coaster of emotions" once they have expressed interest. "The motivation that they experienced can die quickly as the realities of their daily lives take over. It is our job to rekindle that motivation ... to make them once again see the potential of achieving their dream," according to a "sales playbook." A 2009 playbook quotes a Yale University study that found the most persuasive words in the English language are: you, new, money, easy, discovery, free, results, health, save, proven, guarantee and love. "They share three characteristics: they are simple, familiar and dramatic." "The words 'I noticed' have a powerful subconscious effect on people because they send a subliminal message to them that they stood out in the crowd, that they are attractive or charismatic or that they impressed you," the playbook continues. "People love recognition and attention." A federal judge has ordered the release of internal Trump University documents in an ongoing lawsuit against the company, including "playbooks" that advised sales personnel how to market high-priced courses on getting rich through real estate.

A federal judge has ordered the release of internal Trump University documents in an ongoing lawsuit against the company, including "playbooks" that advised sales personnel how to market high-priced courses on getting rich through real estate. The Friday ruling, in which Judge Gonzalo Curiel cited... Trump University offered a three-day seminar for $1,495, using it as a springboard to sell more expensive "Trump Elite" packages for up to $34,995 a year. "You don't sell products, benefits or solutions — you sell feelings," according to the sales playbook. Trump University's core customers are identified in the documents as male heads of households between 40 and 54 years old with annual household incomes of at least $90,000, a college education and a net worth of more than $200,000. One way to identify buyers is to ask what they do for a living. "Let them know that you've found an answer and a way for them to change their lifestyles." During one-on-one conversations, "you may begin with some small-talk to establish rapport but do not let them take control of the conversation," a playbook reads. "You must be very aggressive during these conversations to in order to push them out of their comfort zones." "If they complain about the price, remind them that Trump is the BEST!! This is the last real estate investment they will ever need to make." They hoped to get rich off real estate, and who would be a better mentor than one of the richest men in the world? So they enrolled in Donald Trump's university to learn the tricks of the trade, some of them maxing out their credit cards to pay tens of thousands of dollars for insider knowledge...

So they enrolled in Donald Trump's university to learn the tricks of the trade, some of them maxing out their credit cards to pay tens of thousands of dollars for insider knowledge... For those who have hit credit limits, employees are told to suggest they dip into savings or identify other "seed capital." "Money is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University; if they really believe in you and your product, they will find the money," a playbook reads. Trump University is the target of two lawsuits in San Diego and one in New York that accuse the business of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate. Plaintiffs contend that Trump University gave seminars and classes across the country that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring customers to buy more and, in the end, failing to deliver. Trump has maintained that customers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the offerings — a point that his attorneys repeated after the documents were unsealed. The documents included testimony from several satisfied customers. "Much of the unsealed evidence, including declarations and surveys from former Trump University students, demonstrates the high level of satisfaction from students and that Trump University taught valuable real estate information," said Jill Martin, vice president and assistant general counsel for The Trump Organization. "Trump University looks forward to using this evidence, along with much more, to win when the case is brought before a jury." The documents show meticulous attention to details such as seating at seminars. Room temperature should be set no higher than 68 degrees, and music should be The O'Jays "For the Love of Money." Employees are told to avoid speaking with the news media. "Reporters are rarely on your side and they are not sympathetic," a 2010 playbook reads. The 6-year-old case in San Diego is scheduled to go to trial shortly after the November presidential election. Trump has railed against U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who ordered the documents unsealed. At a rally in San Diego on Friday, he accused the judge of being "hostile" and a "hater of Donald Trump," and raised questions about his ethnicity. "The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great, I think that's fine," Trump said of Curiel, who was born in the U.S. It was the second time Trump has brought up the judge's ethnicity as he complained about his treatment.

A federal judge has ordered the release of internal Trump University documents in an ongoing lawsuit against the company, including "playbooks" that advised sales personnel how to market high-priced courses on getting rich through real estate. The Friday ruling, in which Judge Gonzalo Curiel cited heightened public interest in presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was issued in response to a request by The Washington Post. The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets. Curiel's order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November. Trump, who previously questioned whether Curiel's Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump's support for building a wall on the Mexican border, said Friday that Curiel "happens to be, we believe, Mexican."

Schneiderman alleged in the suit that Trump personally earned $5 million from the enterprise, in which sales personnel were assigned to get people to pay $1,495 for a three-day seminar in real estate techniques. In selling the courses, Trump released a marketing video that said, "We are going to have professors and adjunct professors that are absolutely terrific . . . and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me." One of the university's top executives, Michael Sexton, subsequently testified in one of the class action suits that "none of the professors at the live events" were handpicked by Trump. Depositions released in March quote Trump acknowledging a lack of close involvement with mentors and students.

Campaign and legal representatives for Trump could not be reached for comment Saturday. However, Jill A. Martin, vice president and assistant general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in a written statement in March that the allegations had "no substance." She added that "Trump University was a professionally run company which provided students with a valuable and substantive education and the tools to succeed in business and real estate."

Donald Trump will go to trial in a class-action lawsuit against his now-defunct Trump University after the presidential election but before inauguration if he wins the White House, setting the stage for a president-elect to take the witness stand. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel on Friday scheduled trial for Nov. 28 in the suit that alleges people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars got defrauded. The likely Republican nominee planned to attend most, if not all, of the trial and would testify, Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli said. "He has very, very strong feelings about this case," Petrocelli told reporters. Petrocelli asked for a trial after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, but the judge raised concerns about distractions if Trump wins the election. The attorney said the period between the election and swearing-in is extremely hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to holding a trial during the campaign. The lawsuit is one of three that accuse Trump University of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate. The San Diego suit says Trump University, which no longer operates and was not accredited as a school, gave seminars and classes across the country that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring students to buy more and, in the end, failing to deliver. Trump, who appears on a list of defense witnesses for the trial, has repeatedly pointed to a 98 percent satisfaction rate on internal surveys. But the lawsuit says students were asked to rate the product when they believed they still had more instruction to come and were reluctant to openly criticize their teachers on surveys that were not anonymous. Big-name GOP leaders piled on Friday against Donald Trump in an extraordinary show of Republican-vs.-Republican discontent over his winning the party's presidential nomination. Trump just shrugged it off, declaring they didn't really matter when compared to all the voters who turned out to vote... Big-name GOP leaders piled on Friday against Donald Trump in an extraordinary show of Republican-vs.-Republican discontent over his winning the party's presidential nomination. Trump just shrugged it off, declaring they didn't really matter when compared to all the voters who turned out to vote... Curiel, a judicial appointee of President Barack Obama, has been eager to get to trial and had planned for it this summer before Trump's surge in the primaries. The case was filed in 2010, making it the second-oldest on his docket. Still, he expressed concern about a trial during the campaign, partly out of concern for jurors' safety. "Will they be able to stay clear of the media frenzy?" he asked. "Ultimately that's my Number 1 concern." Since the early 1980s, Trump personally has been sued at least 150 times in federal court, records show. Only a handful of those cases are pending, with the ones involving Trump University — two in California and one in New York — being the most significant. Trump has railed against the judge in the San Diego case, calling him hostile and suggesting his positions may be the result of Trump's stance on border security. The likely GOP nominee has noted Curiel's ethnicity. Trump said of the judge at an Arkansas rally in February: "I believe he happens to be Spanish, which is fine. He's Hispanic — which is fine." Petrocelli said he would not ask for the judge to be removed from the case, despite Trump's views. "He's got very strong views about everything and he expressed his own views," Petrocelli said. Jury selection may begin shortly before Nov. 28, and the trial was expected to last a month or longer, the judge said. Associated Press

The likely Republican nominee planned to attend most, if not all, of the trial and would testify, Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli said. "He has very, very strong feelings about this case," Petrocelli told reporters. Petrocelli asked for a trial after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, but the judge raised concerns about distractions if Trump wins the election. The attorney said the period between the election and swearing-in is extremely hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to holding a trial during the campaign. The lawsuit is one of three that accuse Trump University of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate. The San Diego suit says Trump University, which no longer operates and was not accredited as a school, gave seminars and classes across the country that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring students to buy more and, in the end, failing to deliver. Trump, who appears on a list of defense witnesses for the trial, has repeatedly pointed to a 98 percent satisfaction rate on internal surveys. But the lawsuit says students were asked to rate the product when they believed they still had more instruction to come and were reluctant to openly criticize their teachers on surveys that were not anonymous. Big-name GOP leaders piled on Friday against Donald Trump in an extraordinary show of Republican-vs.-Republican discontent over his winning the party's presidential nomination. Trump just shrugged it off, declaring they didn't really matter when compared to all the voters who turned out to vote... Big-name GOP leaders piled on Friday against Donald Trump in an extraordinary show of Republican-vs.-Republican discontent over his winning the party's presidential nomination. Trump just shrugged it off, declaring they didn't really matter when compared to all the voters who turned out to vote... Curiel, a judicial appointee of President Barack Obama, has been eager to get to trial and had planned for it this summer before Trump's surge in the primaries. The case was filed in 2010, making it the second-oldest on his docket. Still, he expressed concern about a trial during the campaign, partly out of concern for jurors' safety. "Will they be able to stay clear of the media frenzy?" he asked. "Ultimately that's my Number 1 concern." Since the early 1980s, Trump personally has been sued at least 150 times in federal court, records show. Only a handful of those cases are pending, with the ones involving Trump University — two in California and one in New York — being the most significant. Trump has railed against the judge in the San Diego case, calling him hostile and suggesting his positions may be the result of Trump's stance on border security. The likely GOP nominee has noted Curiel's ethnicity. Trump said of the judge at an Arkansas rally in February: "I believe he happens to be Spanish, which is fine. He's Hispanic — which is fine." Petrocelli said he would not ask for the judge to be removed from the case, despite Trump's views. "He's got very strong views about everything and he expressed his own views," Petrocelli said. Jury selection may begin shortly before Nov. 28, and the trial was expected to last a month or longer, the judge said. Associated Press

When Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives on Capitol Hill on Monday morning to begin his confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court, he will give President Donald Trump his first chance to make a lasting imprint on the federal judiciary - and Republicans a fresh test to work their will now that they control all of Washington's levers of power. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, was promoted by conservative legal activists because of his sterling credentials, a decade of right-of-center rulings and his allegiance to the same brand of constitutional interpretation employed by the late justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia. "Single best thing the president's done," said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., a frequent Trump foil who predicted Republican unity on the matter and an easy victory for the president following the string of controversies that Trump has wrought since he took office. All of that also sets up a stark dilemma for Senate Democrats. Monday brings their newest opportunity since the confirmation hearings of Trump's Cabinet to take a stand against a young administration that has horrified liberal Americans with efforts to strip away provisions of the Affordable Care Act, impose an entry ban on some immigrants and deeply cut federal agencies. The left also remains angry about a Supreme Court seat that has sat vacant since Scalia died 13 months ago, after which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., decided to block a hearing for President Barack Obama's selection for the seat, Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. President Donald Trump introduces Judge Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee Jan. 31. President Donald Trump introduces Judge Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee Jan. 31. Gorsuch seemed to forecast what might await him from Democrats in a 2002 column he wrote lamenting the state of the Supreme Court nomination process: "When a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control, grudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed." Yet Democrats are divided about how to take on a genial jurist who has made few waves in the weeks since Trump nominated him and he began meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Gorsuch "is a bit of a puzzle," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We're going to try to put those pieces together so that the puzzle is complete and we have an understanding of what kind of a fifth vote will be going on the court." Asked about what more she hopes to learn about Gorsuch's stances, Feinstein said: "Voting rights. Right to choose. Guns. Corporate dollars in elections. Worker safety. Ability of federal agencies to regulate. All of the environmental issues - water, air." Senators and their staffsare also examining Gorsuch's role as a high-ranking official in the U.S. Justice Department at the time the George W. Bush administration was dealing with Guantanamo Bay detainees, reports of torture and anti-terrorism policies. A new trove of materials released this weekend show Gorsuch playing a central role in coordinating legal and legislative strategy, but portraying himself as reconciling the many opinions of those in the administration rather than driving policy. "I am but the scrivener looking for language that might please everybody," he wrote in one email. Four days of hearings are set to begin Monday, when Gorsuch will sit and listen for several hours as members of the Judiciary Committee read opening statements. He is poised to deliver his opening statement on Monday afternoon, giving senators and the nation an early indication of how he might serve on the court. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Gorsuch is set to face at least 50 minutes of questioning by each member of the panel. The proceedings are expected to conclude Thursday with a panel of witnesses speaking for or against Gorsuch. When Donald Trump was elected president, it looked like the end of the road for Judge Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Not so fast, one Democratic senator with a long-shot plan insisted Monday. After meeting with Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's... When Donald Trump was elected president, it looked like the end of the road for Judge Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Not so fast, one Democratic senator with a long-shot plan insisted Monday. After meeting with Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's... Some of the issues that normally animate Supreme Court confirmation hearings won't depend upon Gorsuch. Decisions from last term showed there was still support on the court for limited affirmative action in higher education, for instance. The majority that found a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry remains. And whatever Gorsuch's position on abortion rights, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's vote to strike down a Texas law last year reaffirmed the court's rulings that say government may not pass restrictions that unduly burden a woman's right to an abortion. But Gorsuch would probably reinforce the court's pro-business image and skepticism about some significant environmental programs begun under Obama. His past decisions show him to be extremely protective of the rights of those who object to even generally applicable government laws and regulations that they say violate their religious beliefs. If Gorsuch is approved in time for the court's April hearings, he could play a significant role in a separation of powers case in which a church complains it was illegally denied a state grant. A conservative movement to curb the power of labor unions - stalled last year by Scalia's death - is sure to resume. Cases involving legal protections for gay and transgender people are likely to arrive at the court soon. Beyond their questions about Gorsuch's own record, Democrats plan to use his confirmation hearing to question the overall direction of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s court. "When I hear my Republican colleagues say, 'We want another judge like Scalia, who isn't an activist,' I say, 'What are you talking about? This has been an incredibly activist court,' " said Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., a member of the Judiciary Committee. "So I want to ask him" about that. The future of the court was a significant factor in Trump winning over conservative voters who might otherwise have been uncomfortable with the candidate's ideology, values and personal history. "Even if people don't like me, they have to vote for me," Trump said at a rally in Virginia last year. "You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court." President Donald Trump's escalating attacks on the federal judiciary drew denunciation Wednesday from his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who told a senator that the criticism was "disheartening" and "demoralizing" to independent federal courts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Gorsuch... President Donald Trump's escalating attacks on the federal judiciary drew denunciation Wednesday from his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who told a senator that the criticism was "disheartening" and "demoralizing" to independent federal courts. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Gorsuch... In November exit polls, more than 1 in 5 voters said that Supreme Court appointments were "the most important factor" in determining their choice; of those voters, 56 percent went to Trump. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Trump's final opponent in last year's presidential campaign, described the Gorsuch pick as "the most transparent Supreme Court selection process in modern times" because Trump drew Gorsuch from a list of 21 candidates supplied to him by conservative legal groups during the campaign. Gorsuch's nomination "is not the product just of ordinary Washington political decision-making but rather a presidential election decided by the American people," Cruz said. Not a single Democrat, meanwhile, has pledged support for Gorsuch. That is partly fueled by a liberal base agitating for a win since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. Unable to block the large majority of Trump's executive branch nominations, some Democrats want to draw blood and force Gorsuch to clear procedural hurdles that require 60 senators to vote in his favor. Republicans have only 52 members in the upper chamber, so they would need eight Democrats to cross the aisle and vote with them. Mounting a filibuster to force such a vote could amount to a declaration of war against Republicans that some Democrats, particularly those from conservative states that voted for Trump last year, may be unwilling to do. "The reality is that there is political pressure on them," Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal American Constitution Society, said of Democrats. The Supreme Court is different from other choices Trump will make, she said, because "this is forever, or at least for the rest of my lifetime." Democrats have expressed specific concern about Gorsuch's record of independence following Trump's criticism of the judiciary, including his remark about the "so-called judge" who struck down his first entry ban. Afterward, Gorsuch called Trump's attacks on the courts "demoralizing." Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans should expect Democrats to aggressively question Gorsuch because "we're in a new world" that includes strong opposition to Trump from working-class voters. "I have deep, deep doubts about him and his judicial demeanor, and the fact that he appears to be a calm, erudite person is not the key issue here," Schumer said. "There are lot of people like that. It's what goes into how he decides cases." Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., holds a news conference with people who claim to have been negatively impacted by the decisions of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch at the U.S. Capitol March 15, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., holds a news conference with people who claim to have been negatively impacted by the decisions of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch at the U.S. Capitol March 15, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said he will ask Gorsuch to weigh in on Trump's push to implement an entry ban on visitors from certain majority-Muslim countries, because "the Supreme Court in the near future will be tested on constitutional questions involving separation of powers." Franken and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said they want to press Gorsuch on his cases involving campaign finance law, while Franken said he will also focus on Gorsuch's record on voting rights and women's reproductive rights. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said he plans to use documents provided by the Justice Department to ask Gorsuch about his years working for Bush on such matters as executive authority and the interrogation of terrorism suspects. Gorsuch "is going to have to establish very much that he'd be independent of any president and that he's going to uphold the rights of all Americans," Leahy said. "He's got a lot of work to do in that regard." Many conservative activists and GOP lawmakers say that the laundry list of Democratic concerns is evidence that they don't quite know how to pin down Gorsuch. Questions about Gorsuch's potential independence from the Trump White House or conservative causes will be "an exercise in self-contradiction for the Democrats," said Leonard Leo, who has been advising Trump on judicial matters and is on leave from his role as executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, which helped advise Trump on his list of potential court nominees. "They want Judge Gorsuch to say, 'I'm my own man, I'm independent, I'm going to evaluate the actions of the executive branch on their own merits without regards to the president or any political issue,' " he said. "And then 10 minutes later they're going to ask him to promise how he's going to rule on Roe v. Wade and every other case that comes before the court." "There'll be an effort to use him as a piñata to jam the president," Leo said, later adding that such attempts would be "unfortunate and inappropriate." And there could be other issues to emerge. With only eight members and the threat of ideological deadlock, the court has seemed reluctant to accept some controversial cases. Gorsuch's nomination to replace Scalia, with whom he shares an "originalist" philosophy of constitutional interpretation, is in some ways like other recent replacements - by some measures a zero sum, ideologically speaking. Bush's two nominees, Roberts and Samuel A. Alito Jr., also replaced Republican nominees. Obama's choices of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan took the places of liberals. But justices' ideologies are not predictable purely by virtue of the party of the president who nominated them. Alito's replacement of the more moderate Sandra Day O'Connor moved the court to the right on several issues, including abortion, voting rights and campaign finance law. "I don't accept the premise that it's 'Scalia's seat,'" Durbin said. "I don't know what the next seat will be or when it will be, so I take each of them seriously." Watching how Gorsuch fares will be the eight current members of the high court, who have said very little publicly in the past year about their diminished ranks. Weeks before Scalia's death, Roberts told an audience in Boston that public skepticism concerning the court starts with the Senate confirmation process. Decades ago, two of the court's most controversial justices - Scalia on the right and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the left - were confirmed practically unanimously, he said. But the three "extremely well-qualified" nominees who followed Roberts - Alito, Sotomayor and Kagan - were approved largely on party-line votes. "That suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees," Roberts said. Skittish Republicans acknowledged that Trump could still spoil Gorsuch's chances. Graham said it could happen "if the president tweets any more about judges." Said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the chamber's second-ranking Republican: "I think the best thing the White House could do is just let the Senate do its work." The Washington Post's Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.

As James Thompson worked his way through a coffee shop, the Democratic candidate for Congress said something that got people to look up from their laptops. "We've got a lead right now." "Really?" said Marla Flentje, a Republican who said she'd voted for him in early balloting. A trio of Democrats walked over to meet Thompson and tell him they'd vote Tuesday. "I hope you do, because right now, we're winning," said Thompson. Thompson was not supposed to win - or even come close - in this largely rural 4th District, which picked Donald Trump for president by 27 points. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R, vacated the seat to lead the CIA, and Republicans expected to hold it easily. Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price's seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November's election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former... Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price's seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November's election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former... But in the final days before Tuesday's special election, Republicans reacted to weak polling and turnout data by rushing resources to southern Kansas. A GOP super PAC rolled out robo-calls over the weekend from Vice President Mike Pence, and on Monday from President Donald Trump, in support of candidate Ron Estes. "Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly," Trump said on the call. "Ron is going to be helping us, big league." On Monday, Republicans also dispatched Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas, for a fly-in, where he urged Kansans to vote "if you're fed up with the stagnation under the Obama economy." Late Monday, the national House Democratic campaign arm announced that it was calling 25,000 households to counter the GOP influx. Readers of the liberal Daily Kos donated a total of $149,000 to Thompson over the final weekend. Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current... Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current... This - the home town of Koch Industries - is the last place the GOP expected to have to undertake a rescue mission. The Kansas seat is one of the reddest of the five House seats vacated in the Trump era, four of them by Republicans who joined the new administration. If Thompson ends up winning here, the national Democratic Party will claim the victory as a portent of bad things to come for Republicans in the 2018 midterms with Trump in the White House. Democrats also have an opportunity in Georgia's 6th District, where Jon Ossoff is surging in the race to replace former congressman Tom Price. R, who is now health and human services secretary. In Kansas, Thompson, a civil rights lawyer who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 presidential caucuses, flew under the radar for weeks. Meanwhile, Estes, the state treasurer, got bogged down as his party staged an unsuccessful rebellion against deeply unpopular Gov. Sam Brownback, R. Estes rarely mentions Trump, but he did reference "fair trade" at the Cruz rally, smoothing over an issue that divides Kansans. As the race has tightened, Republicans, who are still favored to win Tuesday, have strained to make the election a referendum on liberalism. Brownback, invisible on the trail, didn't help matters by vetoing a bipartisan Medicaid expansion bill last month; his most favorable polling puts his job-approval rating below 25 percent, even in the 4th District. In November, as Republicans were scoring upsets around the country, they lost three state House seats in the Wichita area. Several more-conservative Republicans lost primaries to moderate candidates. "People here still like Trump," said Thompson, whose campaign signs identify him not as a Democrat but as an Army veteran. "It's not been a referendum on him. It's a referendum on the failed Republican leadership in the state. People don't want these policies taken to the national level." In Wichita, where turnout in early voting has been high, Brownback's name has the force of an epithet. As she settled in for lunch at the Anchor, a downtown gastropub where Thompson stopped to shake hands, Kayla Marshall said she didn't vote in the 2016 election. She would, she said, vote for Thompson - and to explain why, she talked about teachers buying pencils with their own money because Brownback had cut the education budget. Lynn Jones, who opened his door to Thompson canvassers Monday morning, was quick to say he'd voted for George W. Bush. Brownback, he said, was nothing like Bush. "OK, he was trying something new with his tax cuts, but the experiment didn't work," Jones said. "When the laboratory explodes, you probably ought to try a different formula." Thompson, a first-time candidate, was generally ignored by both parties for most of the race. When his campaign asked the state Democratic Party to fund a mailer, it was turned down, later investing just $3,000. In an interview last week, Democratic National Committee Chairman Thomas Perez said the national party would not be transferring any late money. "We can make progress in Kansas," Perez said. "There are thousands of elections every year, though. Can we invest in all of them? That would require a major increase in funds." Thompson spoke before Sanders at a February rally and has been endorsed by Sanders' group, Our Revolution. According to recent fundraising reports, Estes has raised $459,000 to Thompson's $292,000. Outside groups, which are pouring money into Georgia ahead of the April 18 contest there, have left Kansas alone. "The Democrats think so much of their candidate there that they've spent zero dollars," said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Republican-allied Congressional Leadership Fund. "We'll win the Kansas election by double digits." His group is now funding robo-calls targeting local Republicans, who outnumber Democrats but have been sluggish to turn out. The National Republican Congressional Committee has spent close to $100,000, multiplying Estes's presence on the airwaves. Thompson's campaign reacted with delight to the robo-calls, viewing them as not just ineffective but as sign of his viability. Because he's getting so little attention - no trackers from the other party were following him Monday - Thompson talked freely with a voter concerned about abortion, agreeing that society should do more to lower abortion rates. He dismissed a last-minute TV ad accusing him of favoring abortions for sex selection as representing his views to a "ludicrous and false extreme." His final TV spot featured him shooting an AR-15 as a narrator called him a "fighter who grew up in poverty," but the National Rifle Association was not on the air to contradict him. What was on the air for Estes was rote - and telling of how Republicans have struggled to find a pro-Trump rallying cry. One of Estes' first commercials featured him in waders, joking that "after eight years of Obama, America is weaker and the swamp is deeper than we thought," as an alligator poked its head up for emphasis. Democrats haven't won here since the early 1990s; then-Rep. Dan Glickman, D, was swept out by a Republican wave in 1994. Glickman vastly outspent his opponent, but the Republicans made up for it with a grass-roots surge of antiabortion activists. In 2014, when Bliss helped Sen. Pat Roberts, R, secure victory, he got a similar late-game boost from social conservatives. Those wins came when Democrats controlled the White House. On Monday, when more than 150 Republican voters piled into the Estes-Cruz rally, some wore anti-Hillary Clinton merchandise; all cheered when Cruz recalled how his "lips curled into a smile" when he saw a Democratic colleague mourn Clinton's defeat. The cheering was quieter when Cruz and Estes described the stakes of the election. They spoke generally about repealing the Affordable Care Act, though Estes said he opposed the GOP replacement bill that fizzled last month. Cruz talked up tax reform by staging a contrast: "Unlike Obamacare, I'm convinced we can get it done." Estes, meanwhile, packaged himself as an agent of common sense and disruption, without mentioning the work he'd done with Brownback. "I'm going to Washington to change Washington," he said. "When I go to Washington, I want to get to a balanced budget." The Republican majority that Estes would join does not have a balanced-budget plan. In interviews at the rally, Estes' voters said they were thrilled that Neil Gorsuch had been confirmed to the Supreme Court, but they had little else to say about Congress. Asked what he thought of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., John Bernhardt, who sported an early-voting sticker on a red-white-and-blue polo shirt, answered with a grimace. "Can I plead the fifth?" he said. Joyce Wallace, who got a plum position near the rally stage, said she had no qualms about sending a Trump ally to Washington. "I'm all for Trump," she said. "I think he's fulfilling his campaign promises." Not every Republican at the event agreed. Cathy Dowell, who like Wallace had caucused for Cruz in 2016, worried that Trump went back on a campaign pledge by attacking a Syrian airfield. "I'm a little worried about Trump," Dowell said. "I know he's not a conservative, and I think he's making a mistake in Syria." But the two Republicans found something to agree on: Both would be happy if Carl Brewer, the Democrat who just finished two terms as mayor of Wichita, replaced Brownback in the governor's office.

Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price's seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November's election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional staffer and preternaturally on-message candidate. He has raised a whopping $8.3 million for the special election to replace Price in Georgia's 6th Congressional District - more than anyone has ever collected to win this seat, which has not been represented by a Democrat for nearly four decades. Ossoff is a first-time candidate who is leading the field of five Democrats and 11 Republicans in the April 18 special election. If he does not receive more than 50 percent of the vote in that race, the top two vote-getters will move on to a runoff on June 20. The progressive and anti-Trump groups founded through the nonprofit Indivisible project after November's election are plunging in to help him, and the liberal blog Daily Kos is channeling donors Ossoff's way. Most of Ossoff's money, $7.7 million, came though the progressive donation hub ActBlue. Republicans have tried to toxify him by raising the specter of meddling out-of-state liberals - only 6 percent of the money is from Georgia - but Ossoff points to his volunteers. "The atmosphere in Georgia is electric right now," Ossoff said in a short interview at his parents' home. "Thousands of folks, many of whom have never been engaged in politics before, working together to make the statement that we think the country can only become stronger and more prosperous and more secure if we stick to our core values." Republicans, however, are fighting back, unwilling to easily cede a district Trump won by 1.5 percentage points in 2016 - albeit, down from the 23.3-point margin enjoyed by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Outside groups and the national Republican Party are spending millions to paint the Democrat in their television ads as the hope of window-smashing anarchists who want him in Congress. Georgia Republican Party mailers darkly warn about Ossoff's work for the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera network. (The mailers print the network's Arabic name on a black background, resembling the flag of ISIS.) The National Rifle Association warns, in drawling radio ads, that Democrats want to "steal this election and your freedom." President Donald Trump with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price are seen in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 24, 2017. President Donald Trump with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price are seen in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 24, 2017. Asked about the attacks Friday, Ossoff paused, then rattled off adjectives. "Predictable, cynical, partisan, negative politics, with a whiff of desperation," he said. Ossoff's lead may also be artificially inflated. The number of Republicans running here means the GOP vote is split, and no contender is likely to win the more than 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a runoff. It's possible that Republicans will unite around whoever emerges from their field. It is also possible that the progressive energy kicked up because of Trump's presidency could see its first real victory here in Georgia in the campaign to "flip the sixth." The race will test Democrats' strength in the kind of districts they need to win if they hope to retake the House in 2018 - mainly suburban areas that have become more demographically diverse. Five special elections are underway in congressional districts where Trump pulled Republicans out of Congress to join his administration. All came from safely red districts or states; in three of them, small donors and political groups are churning up competitive races. On Friday, Republicans announced new spending in Kansas's much more Republican 4th District, which votes Tuesday - Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he'd fly from Texas to campaign there. Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power.

Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current... But the Georgia race has attracted more money and volunteers. No open House district swung harder away from Republicans in 2016. The district is diverse, rich and highly educated, a microcosm of the "rising American electorate" that Democrats hoped to ride to victory last year. Ossoff paints himself as a pragmatist, willing to work with both sides of the aisle. But he has also taken on Trump, running a campaign ad that shows him tweeting that he will "stand up to Donald Trump because anyone can send a tweet." Sitting silently on a desk in a suit with a blue tie, the only sound is of the Democrat typing on his smartphone. His words run across the screen as though they were being posted to Twitter. "He should act like a president," the ad ends. Republicans and their allied groups are fighting the money and the messenger. The National Republican Congressional Committee is running ads invoking Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi. The Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, closely allied with House GOP leaders, debuted a widely panned ad that used old footage of Ossoff in a Han Solo costume to portray him as immature. Since then, the super PAC has attacked Ossoff for contracting with Al Jazeera on a documentary film - about the Islamic State - and tied him to the anarchists who disrupted Trump's inauguration. In a memo to donors, the CLF credits its ads with giving Ossoff a net negative favorable rating - with 60 percent of voters viewing him as liberal - and with keeping him far from the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff. "The only thing he's ever accomplished in his life is having the fortune to be born to rich parents who will spend millions of dollars on him," said Corry Bliss, the CLF's executive director, who plans to spend at least $2.2 million in Georgia. "You could go down to Georgia, give anyone $8 million, and they'd get 40 percent of the vote." In the first 10 days of early voting, 17,871 ballots have been cast and self-identified Democrats have outnumbered Republicans by a 19-point margin. On Friday, however, the Democratic margin was just five points. By Sunday, the CLF was up with its third commercial branding Ossoff a "rubber stamp" for Pelosi, ending with the plea "vote Republican." "People aren't very happy about it, but we're also like: Hey, they're feeling threatened," said Amy Nosek, 42, of the district's Indivisible Georgia chapter. "They're fighting back, because we're fighting." The reasons for that confidence were on display at this week's candidate debate, held at the Atlanta Press Club. Ossoff had ready (and sometimes wooden) answers to questions about his resume. He responded with flawless Hill-speak to ads accusing him of inflating his experience working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga.: "For two annual fiscal authorizations for the Department of Defense, I contributed language to the National Defense Authorization Act." Meanwhile, Ossoff's rivals had their arms full defending the Republican record in the Trump era. Karen Handel, a near-miss candidate in two statewide races - currently polling highest to make the runoff's second spot - repeatedly rejected the House GOP's health-care proposal and the negotiations to strip "essential health benefits" from the current system. "That's not Tom Price's plan," said Handel. "Not every single time do we have a mandate that is horrible." Moments later, longtime tea party activist and candidate Amy Kremer said that she, too, opposed the bill; Ossoff deflected one of her attacks by praising her "bipartisanship" for criticizing both parties. "The people in that district are educated, and they're tired of the mudslinging they saw in the presidential campaign, so it doesn't work like it used to," Johnson said. "They're looking at issues. They were promised a bill of goods that was not delivered." Republicans hope that in a runoff, with Ossoff facing just one Republican, he won't be able to zoom around the partisan differences. But every Ossoff event, or interview, offers more evidence of how he is already effectively smoothing away those rifts. On Friday night, speaking to a house party of about 50, the Democrat fielded questions on health care, infrastructure and partisanship itself. "The only test to policy that I'll supply is, is it in the interest of this community?" said Ossoff. "If it is, I'll support it. If it's not, I won't. I'll work with anyone who wants to help us here and help the country, and I'll stand up to anyone who doesn't, regardless of party." On Friday, Ossoff's style helped him evade the sort of issue that can swerve a campaign off-course - Trump's missile strikes on Syria. Ossoff's ads portray the president as reckless and in need of congressional checks. "Congress has an important role to play in ensuring the conduct of U.S. foreign policy is the interest of the American people, but so too does the commander in chief have significant discretion to act where appropriate," Ossoff said. Georgia Democrats have long memories about moderate-looking candidates getting whipsawed by international events. In 2002, then-Sen. Max Cleland, a Democrat who lost his legs and one arm in Vietnam, lost after an ad shamed him for votes against the Department of Homeland Security - and illustrated it with images of Osama bin Laden. The new ads, from both the CLF and the Georgia Republican Party, also try to blur a strength - Ossoff's documentary company that reported on the Islamic State - into a question-raising weakness. "It's disgusting, and it's eerily reminiscent of what they did against me in 2002," said Cleland. "But people are sick and tired of that kind of stuff."

Earlier this week, before heading downstairs to speak to nearly three thousand Kentuckians, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reminisced about his 2016 presidential campaign. After he had gained steam, and his rallies had become arena-size events, he was struck by the difference between his crowds and those at Democratic Party fundraisers. "We'd have a rally with five or ten thousand young people out, a great deal of energy," Sanders said between bites of a steak sandwich. "Then I'd walk into a room and there'd be a thousand people from the Democratic Party. You were in two different worlds - one full of energy, one full of idealism. And the other, full of good people - I don't mean to put 'em down - who are the bedrock of the Democratic Party." At that moment, Sanders was on the second day of a week-long, cross-country speaking tour with Democratic National Committee Chairman Thomas Perez. The DNC was picking up half the bill for the 12-seat chartered plane as well as the venues, including the downtown Louisville Palace. As Sanders spoke, Perez was a block away, meeting with party leaders who - like most Democratic leaders - had backed Hillary Clinton for president. Later that evening, they would take a stage and praise Sanders, who is not a Democrat, for reinvigorating their party. A chairman who defeated Sanders's preferred candidate to run the DNC was now touring as his opening act. "Our values are aligned on so many of the critical issues that confront the nation and the Democratic Party," Perez said in an interview. "When people actually look at the platform of the Democratic Party - they'll say, 'We need community college!' - well, look at the platform. When they say, 'We need a $15 minimum wage' - look at the platform." The first 24 hours of the tour revealed both the strength and the seams in the strategy. It began in Portland, Maine, on Monday evening, where a crowd wrapped around the State Theatre to see the "Come Together, Fight Back" tour. Maine's Democratic Party leaders flitted through the crowds with clipboards, encouraging fans of Sanders to sign up. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats to reach out to President Donald Trump's supporters to promote a progressive agenda that includes guaranteed health care for all Americans as part of a strategy to rebuild the party. Sanders told a boisterous crowd Tuesday night in Louisville that Trump... Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats to reach out to President Donald Trump's supporters to promote a progressive agenda that includes guaranteed health care for all Americans as part of a strategy to rebuild the party. Sanders told a boisterous crowd Tuesday night in Louisville that Trump... They had competition. A group of rogue "Berniecrats" had brought clipboards of their own, with petitions encouraging the senator to run for president in 2020 as an independent. When the rally began, a mention of Perez was met with boos audible over mild applause; the loudest heckling came from a man whose T-shirt declared his support for the Green Party. Once onstage, Perez described his Democratic Party as a vessel for activists, with a platform they could love. It was activists, he said, who stopped the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It was activists who had passed a minimum wage hike, which Maine's Republican governor had halted. "In these first 100 days, the most remarkable thing is not what Donald Trump did - the most remarkable thing is what you did across the county," Perez said. The chairman left the stage, and a disembodied announcer introduced Sanders. This time, there were no boos; over 48 minutes, Sanders mentioned Perez's DNC only once. Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained roars of approval from a friendly crowd on Monday as he called for a radical transformation of the Democratic Party into a grassroots movement founded on the tenets of his unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign: fighting against the billionaire... Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained roars of approval from a friendly crowd on Monday as he called for a radical transformation of the Democratic Party into a grassroots movement founded on the tenets of his unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign: fighting against the billionaire... "Our job is to radically transform the Democratic Party into a 50-state party," Sanders said. "Our job is to create a democratic Democratic Party, a grass-roots party, where decisions are made from the bottom up." Any Sanders supporter could crack that code. In 2016, especially after it became clear that he could not win the nomination, Sanders and his delegates waged a largely successful campaign to move the party to the left. The platform Perez could not praise quickly enough had been altered to endorse Sanders's economic issues, as well as marijuana decriminalization and the end of a ban on federal money paying for abortion. A "unity commission," created to appease Sanders delegates who blamed "superdelegates" for skewing the primaries, had finally been impaneled - and Sanders was watching to see whether it followed his advice. Since Clinton's general election loss, there was little resistance inside the party to Sanders's politics. As the plane flew to Louisville, a Harvard-Harris poll was being released that found Sanders polling at 57 percent favorability with all voters. No politician in America was better-liked. "Sanders is an asset to the Democrats," said Mark Penn, a former Clinton pollster and strategist, in a statement about the poll. In Kentucky, where Clinton pipped Sanders in the primary, the senator's star power followed him to every stop. After he finished his steak sandwich, a souvenir-seeker raced to his half-empty plate and picked up a french fry, waving it at a table of his friends like a trophy. On a midday visit to Frankfort, where the millennial-focused news site Mic had convened a group of Kentucky voters, Sanders walked past posters from his 2016 bid that had never left the venue's windows; selfie-seekers waited more than an hour to see him. "The reason we are on this tour is to do nothing less than try to revitalize American democracy," Sanders said. Doing so did not mean going easy on Democrats. In Frankfort, as in Monday's speeches, Perez and Sanders suggested that Democrats had lost voters to Trump's GOP because they had stopped talking to them. Perez and Sanders took turns explaining to the Mic-assembled panel that Democrats wanted to help them all - to provide free college education, to pay coal miners' pensions, to make health care cheaper. "I suspect that the Democratic Party here in Kentucky has not done the kind of job that it should have done in explaining [that] hundreds of thousands of people have received health care," Sanders said to a scrum of reporters after the panel. Perez, who has criticized Democrats for the same sins, took more shots at the Trump presidency. "The cost of one trip to Mar-a-Lago would fund the White House logs database for 13 years," he said, after a windup about the Trump budget's spending cuts. On the way back to Louisville, Perez suggested that Democrats had countless opportunities to portray Trump as a phony populist; the challenge was in focusing, and getting anyone to listen. "Your life is not going to improve if your family member, who has an opioid addiction, loses his health care," said Perez. "Your life isn't going to improve if an infrastructure bill doesn't have prevailing wage requirements." On Tuesday, as the tour continued, Perez and Sanders fell in and out of sync. Perez had spent weeks talking up Jon Ossoff, the Democrat trying to win the suburban Atlanta congressional district vacated when Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price joined the Trump administration. After a closer-than-expected April 11 defeat in a Kansas district, Perez thought Democrats needed to "swing at everything." Sanders was less interested in the Ossoff race. "He's not a progressive," he explained. He was endorsing Democrats based on their economic populism; they could differ from progressives on social issues, but not on the threat of the mega-rich to American politics. Soon, he said, the restored 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court was likely to make it legal for the wealthy to give unlimited sums to candidates, and the only way to fight back was grass roots politicking and small donations. "If you are running in rural Mississippi, do you hold the same criteria as if you're running in San Francisco?" he said. "I think you'd be a fool to think that's all the same." Sanders had said this before, and each time, he'd sparked anger from a center-left ready to accuse him of abandoning women or nonwhite voters. On Thursday, he was set to campaign in Omaha for Heath Mello, a Democrat running for mayor who had previously backed a bill requiring ultrasounds for women considering abortion. But Perez and Sanders were on the same page about candidate diversity. "I live in the people's republic of Takoma Park," Perez explained. "If you demand fealty on every single issue, then it's a challenge. The Democratic Party platform acknowledges that we're pro-choice; but there are communities, like some in Kansas, where people have a different position." By Tuesday night, the tour was starting to click. There was just one heckler in the Palace, who yelled "corporate shill" at the chairman during a quiet moment. As in Maine, there was a standing ovation when the local member of Congress, a Democrat who had backed Clinton, endorsed Sanders's call for "single-payer," Canada-style health care. And there was a smoother stage show. Perez himself introduced Sanders, and the senator told their audience to "bring millions of people into the political process" and create "a political system not dominated by a handful of billionaires." After 45 minutes, Perez re-emerged from backstage, following Sanders to the place where a bluegrass band called Relic was playing "This Land is Your Land." The two of them clapped along, belting out Woody Guthrie's lyrics. From a distance, it looked like they were singing in harmony.

Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who doggedly investigated Hillary Clinton before the 2016 presidential election but declined to investigate President Donald Trump, abruptly announced Wednesday that he won't run for re-election. Chaffetz, who has been rumored as a possible candidate for Senate or governor, said that after consulting with his family and "prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018." The 50-year-old Chaffetz had strolled to four easy re-elections in his Republican-friendly congressional district. But he was facing a surprising challenge from a Democratic newcomer who raised more than a half-million dollars by tapping into anger over Chaffetz's recent comment suggesting people should spend their money on health insurance instead of iPhones. Political unknown Dr. Kathryn Allen has been transformed into a liberal hero for calling out Chaffetz on Twitter, gaining an early boost in name recognition. Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also drew fire from Democrats after saying he would not investigate Trump's business empire, given that he had promised before the presidential election that he would investigate Clinton "for years" if she was elected. "It's a tough decision. I love serving in Congress, but I love my family more," Chaffetz said in an interview Wednesday with KSL Newsradio in Salt Lake City. "I really meant it when I said I was going to get in, serve and get out." Running for Utah governor in 2020 is a possibility, Chaffetz said, but he's not willing to commit one way or another. "I'm trying to leave the door open for possibilities down the road," he said. Chaffetz led a nearly two-year investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, continuing the inquiry even after the 2016 election. And he and other Republicans asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Clinton lied to Congress during her 2015 testimony to House Benghazi panel. In a statement on Facebook, Chaffetz noted that he has long advocated that public service should be for a limited time. He said that after more than 1,500 nights away from home, "it is time" to step aside. Chaffetz said he has "no ulterior motives" is healthy and confident he would re-elected. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted that Chaffetz is "a great defender of liberty and limited government" and wished him the best. Still, Chaffetz has run into political turbulence. He was met by frequent, deafening boos at a February town hall as constituents grilled him on everything from investigating Trump's tax returns to Planned Parenthood. Chaffetz repeatedly said, "hold on," and "give me a second," as audience members in a Salt Lake City suburb reacted negatively to nearly all of his statements and implored him to "do your job" and investigate Trump. In a CNN interview in March, Chaffetz was asked how lower-income Americans would get access to health insurance if the Affordable Care Act, also known as "Obamacare," is repealed by congressional Republicans. "Americans have choices," he responded. "Maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love, and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care." The remarks triggered a firestorm of criticism on social media with people comparing how many iPhones they could buy if they didn't have to pay medical bills in the tens of thousands of dollars. Chaffetz later conceded on Fox News that his point about people being self-reliant didn't come out as smoothly as it could have. Half of the voters are registered Republicans in Chaffetz' 3rd congressional district, which stretches from suburban Salt Lake City to desert towns in southeastern Utah and includes heavily conservative Mormon areas. Chaffetz won 73 percent of the vote last fall, and Trump won the district by 24 points. While Chaffetz declined to investigate Trump, he did criticize a top Trump aide who promoted Ivanka Trump's fashion line during a cable TV appearance from the White House. Chaffetz called Kellyanne Conway's actions "wrong, wrong, wrong" and joined Cummings in asking the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter. Chris Karpowitz, co-director at Brigham Young University's Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, said Chaffetz may be seeking to avoid a potentially embarrassing primary loss or close race in 2018 that could hurt his prospects for the 2020 governor's race. "It's still somewhat surprising to me," Karpowitz said. "It seems that at the first sign of trouble, he's decided not to run." Chaffetz is at least the seventh House Republican to resign this year or announce plans to retire, including four who left to join Trump's Cabinet. Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota is running for governor, and Reps. Sam Johnson of Texas and Lynn Jenkins of Kansas are retiring.

Stephen Bannon could barely finish his sentences as he implored the listeners of his Breitbart News radio show to see the new movie "Clinton Cash." It was July 20, the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, and Bannon was describing Bill and Hillary Clinton as "scumbags" and "bandits" who had made millions of dollars through political connections. "Hillary and Bill Clinton are the two single biggest grifters ever to run for president of the United States," Bannon told his guest, Peter Schweizer, the author of the book behind the movie. Bannon, now President Donald Trump's chief strategist, framed his radio show that day as an urgent effort to reveal important information for voters - but there was more to it. The show and "Clinton Cash" were components of an intricate multimedia machine comprising nonprofit organizations and private companies that Bannon had leveraged to advance his conservative, populist agenda and bring in millions of dollars. That effort ultimately helped propel Trump into the White House and Bannon into national prominence. A close look behind Bannon's radio broadcast that day offers insights about how that machine worked. As it happened, the research behind "Clinton Cash" had been funded by the Government Accountability Institute, or the GAI, a tax-exempt public charity that Bannon had created a few years earlier and that had paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars as executive chairman, documents show. "Clinton Cash" had been produced by Glittering Steel and Bannon Film Industries, two companies owned by Bannon, who was one of the screenwriters. Bannon also was an owner of ARC Entertainment, the firm listed as distributor of the film. And he was receiving a six-figure salary as executive chairman of Breitbart News, which heavily promoted the film through Bannon's radio program and its controversial website. There's no telling how many in his audience understood the connections. Many of the links are scattered among corporate, court and tax records, as well as in a financial disclosure report for 2016 that the White House released last week. During the July broadcast, Bannon only hinted at the connections, saying: "We're now going to put this film up for the whole world to see starting this weekend." President Donald Trump has removed chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council, reversing an earlier, controversial decision to give Bannon access to the group's high-level meetings. A new memorandum about the council's composition was published Wednesday in the Federal Register.... President Donald Trump has removed chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council, reversing an earlier, controversial decision to give Bannon access to the group's high-level meetings. A new memorandum about the council's composition was published Wednesday in the Federal Register.... A Washington Post examination found that Bannon was able to produce more than a dozen conservative documentaries over the past decade by drawing on a network of two-dozen nonprofit organizations and private companies. Bannon helped arrange donations from wealthy Republicans to the nonprofits that paid him for films and other work, documents show. At the same time, Bannon and his firms took in at least $2 million from the nonprofits and an additional $5 million from the private companies, records show. Bannon, who had already made millions on Wall Street, often was paid in multiple ways for each project - a common practice in Hollywood, where he had worked as an entertainment financier. Because he was paid through the nonprofit and private companies, which have limited obligations to disclose details about their activities, the total pay to Bannon remains unknown. In a personal financial disclosure released by the White House last week, Bannon reported his net worth as between $11.8 million and $53.8 million. Bannon, the White House and Schweizer did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Tax specialists told The Post that some of Bannon's activities raise questions about compliance with Internal Revenue Service restrictions against using tax-exempt charities to attack a political candidate or for excessive personal financial benefit. "The appearance is you have a tightknit group of friends and political allies working together to provide benefits, to Mr. Bannon in particular," said David Nelson, a specialist on nonprofit organizations and former tax partner at the Ernst & Young accounting firm, who reviewed records detailing the complex ties between Bannon and the nonprofit groups. Misuse of the tax-exempt nonprofit system for financial and political benefit has become widespread, but such transgressions rarely result in meaningful penalties, according to the experts interviewed by The Post. "It is being manipulated so badly," said Paul Streckfus, a former tax lawyer at the IRS and editor of the EO Tax Journal. "It's a joke." David Bossie, who heads two nonprofit groups that collaborated with Bannon on some of his films, praised him in an interview with The Post. "We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve Bannon and our products. We're very proud of all our films," said Bossie, president of the nonprofit Citizens United and its affiliate foundation. "The First Amendment is an amazing thing." Bannon, 63, accumulated millions from the 1980s through the early 2000s as a financier on Wall Street and in Hollywood, where he immersed himself in the nuances of film production and distribution. He had a yen for making movies and could sequester himself for days and weeks to write scripts and film treatments, former colleagues said. Drawing on lessons from both New York and Hollywood, Bannon was able to command substantial consulting fees from companies while serving as a part-time adviser for both financing and creative work. In 2004, Bannon made a political-oriented documentary, "In the Face of Evil: Reagan's War in Word and Deed," based on a book by Schweizer about the 40th president. During the movie's promotion, Bannon met a rising star of conservative media named Andrew Breitbart. But more important to Bannon's career as the auteur of agenda-driven documentaries was Bossie, who got his start as a political activist and investigator working in opposition to Bill Clinton and his Democratic allies. Bossie had served a controversial stint as the chief investigator for the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, under Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. By the mid-2000s, Bossie was the head of Citizens United, a conservative tax-exempt group in the District whose mission was to educate the public about the importance of "a strong national defense, Constitutionally limited government, free market economics, belief in God and Judeo-Christian values, and the recognition of the family as the basic social unit of our society." At the time, Bannon was working as chairman of the board for a media-distribution company in Los Angeles called Genius Products, which focused on independent films. Steve Bannon was running an investment banking company in Beverly Hills when his partner called with urgent news: a potential $10 billion deal was about to unfold in New York City involving a company they hoped to continue representing - and they didn't want to be left out of the action. Bannon,... Steve Bannon was running an investment banking company in Beverly Hills when his partner called with urgent news: a potential $10 billion deal was about to unfold in New York City involving a company they hoped to continue representing - and they didn't want to be left out of the action. Bannon,... "Steve really liked the idea of helping the smaller guy, the smaller independent filmmakers" who might not get attention from larger distributors, Trevor Drinkwater, chief executive of Genius, told The Post in an interview. Bossie and Bannon bonded over their shared interest in using film to spread a conservative message. Both men wanted to replicate what liberal activist Michael Moore had done two years earlier with his cinematic scorching of President George W. Bush in "Fahrenheit 9/11." "We wanted to deliver a message," Bossie told The Post. In 2006, Bossie envisioned a movie, to be called "Border War: The Battle Over Illegal Immigration," that would take viewers into drug- and human-trafficking tunnels under the U.S. border. Bannon agreed to serve as executive producer of the film. He agreed to use Genius, his fledgling company, to distribute it on DVD. It was the start of a lucrative, increasingly influential relationship that in the coming decade would help him rise in the conservative ranks - and increase the wealth Bannon had amassed on Wall Street and in Hollywood. According to a divorce filing submitted by his third wife in 2008, Bannon had assets worth $41 million. Corporate documents show Genius, a public company, started out paying his consulting firm, Bannon Strategic Advisors, $250,000 per year. Drinkwater said Bannon offered business advice and had ties to investment bankers and hedge-fund managers. "He had incredible connections everywhere. I don't think there was one meeting he couldn't get," Drinkwater said. Even as Genius struggled financially, Bannon continued earning his fees, about $1.5 million over five years, court records show. In May 2008, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Genius said: "We have a history of significant losses, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability." The company later went bankrupt. In 2010, Bannon and Drinkwater started a film-distribution company based in Santa Monica, California, called ARC Entertainment. At the same time, Bannon jumped headlong into his side career as a political-documentary filmmaker. It was a fertile time for a conservative filmmaking. The midterm elections were approaching, the tea party was coalescing in opposition to President Barack Obama and radical conservatives saw themselves at war with what they perceived as a federal government bent on imposing godless socialism. In January 2010, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in favor of Citizens United in a two-year-old lawsuit that the charity filed over election rules prohibiting them from spending money to promote an anti-Clinton documentary during the 2008 primary season. That decision allowed new forms of unlimited political spending by organizations such as Citizens United - an opening that was immediately seized upon by megadonors on the right opposed to the Obama administration. When Citizens United decided to move forward with additional films, Bossie turned to Bannon to write, direct and produce for Citizens United Productions, a for-profit company started by the nonprofit organization and an anonymous investor. Bossie declined to reveal the investor's identity. Tax filings examined by The Post show that Citizens United invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first movie, "Generation Zero." Bossie was co-producer. The film focused on the global financial crisis that began in 2008. It had the hallmarks of a Bannon production. Fast-cut editing. Ominous music. The use of images of tornadoes and nuclear explosions to symbolize the ravages of Wall Street's meltdown, along with footage of free-loving hippies to suggest that the blame lay with the political left. "He's an incredible visionary filmmaker and well read and he gets immersed in his subject matter," Bossie said of Bannon. "He's brilliant, a brilliant writer and director." Costs were kept down on the low-budget films by the use of stock footage and commentary from Republican luminaries. It is not clear from the public documents how much of the fees paid to Bannon or his companies went to production costs or overhead. In 2010, Bannon made the next two films, "Battle for America," a harsh critique of the Obama Administration, and big government, and "Fire from the Heartland," which spotlights the rise of conservative women. Citizens United Foundation Productions spent $1.7 million that year on the production and distribution of what it called "educational documentary films," while Citizens United spent $1.9 million on film production, according to financial filings. The flag fluttering above the U.S. Capitol is emblazoned with a crescent and star. Chants of "Allahu Akbar" rise from inside the building. That's the provocative opening scene of a documentary-style movie outlined 10 years ago by Steve Bannon that envisioned radical Muslims taking over the country... The flag fluttering above the U.S. Capitol is emblazoned with a crescent and star. Chants of "Allahu Akbar" rise from inside the building. That's the provocative opening scene of a documentary-style movie outlined 10 years ago by Steve Bannon that envisioned radical Muslims taking over the country... That same year, Bannon's filmmaking career got a boost from another conservative tax-exempt charity. Young America's Foundation in northern Virginia, hired Bannon Film Industries to begin work on at least three films, paying nearly $578,000 between 2010 and 2012, according to tax filings. That included two documentaries for the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, which the foundation manages, and "The Conservatives," a 29-minute short film meant to inspire conservative student leaders on college campuses. On its website, the foundation calls itself "the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement." It was led by a conservative activist, Ronald Robinson, who also sat on the boards of Citizens United and the Citizens United Foundation. Driven by a fount of ideas and restless energy, Bannon was becoming a tribune of the insurgent conservative vanguard. "I think he worked on a lot of things simultaneously," Drinkwater said. "That's his personality. He probably sleeps three hours a night and can do a lot of things at the same time well." In addition to his fees for writing, directing and producing, Bannon was receiving $22,500 a month, or $270,000 annually, in consulting fees from ARC Entertainment, his film-distribution company, according to a home lease application Bannon signed in 2013 that was obtained by The Post this spring. Kirk Wickstrom, chief financial officer of ARC Entertainment from 2010 to 2013, said that Bannon was the company's sole board member and played an advisory role. "He wasn't tremendously hands-on," Wickstrom said. "We didn't use him that much; mostly when deals came along, he'd take a look at them." In 2011, Bannon decided to make a film about Sarah Palin, a darling of the tea party and presumed presidential contender, to be known as "The Undefeated." According to one associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want national exposure, Bannon had developed a set of principles for his filmmaking. They would be built around "male-, testosterone-, spiritual-driven content." And Bannon would "never put [his] own money into any project." The producer of the Palin film was a Tallahassee, Florida-based company that Bannon had formed with a few investors in 2010. Bannon told some of his investors that he was treating "The Undefeated" as a moneymaking venture and expected solid returns, the associate said. Bannon's company, ARC Entertainment, would distribute it. Despite Bannon's optimism, the movie tanked after Palin backed away from a White House run. In 2011, Bannon forged an alliance with the wealthy Mercer family in New York. Robert Mercer was a hedge-fund billionaire who was on his way to becoming one of the most generous conservative political donors in the country. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer operated the Mercer Family Foundation, a fast-growing source of funding for conservative causes, with assets of nearly $38 million as of 2012. They began relying on Bannon for political advice. Bannon drafted a business plan for the family that called on them to invest $10 million in the fledgling Breitbart News operated by Bannon's friend Andrew Breitbart, according to the New Yorker magazine. Bannon joined the board of the news site. Documents show that money from the Mercer Family Foundation began flowing to some of the same charities that funded Bannon's films and other work. In 2012, the Mercer foundation donated $2 million to the nonprofit Citizens United Foundation, which then gave one of Bannon's consulting firms $300,000 as a "fund raising fee," according to IRS documents. New York and other states require that individuals or firms that raise money for nonprofit organizations register with the state. Bannon's firm was not registered in New York at the time, state officials told The Post. When asked about the fee, Bossie, president of both Citizens United and its foundation, described the fundraising label as a clerical error. He said the payment was actually related to film consulting that Bannon provided. In a statement, Bossie said the fee "has no material bearing on the organization's financial affairs and given the time that has transpired does not merit a correction" to the group's tax filing. An audit report for the Citizens United Foundation that year appears to contradict Bossie. It lists fundraising expenses of $301,200, according to a copy of the audit examined by The Post. After The Post asked about the discrepancy, officials in the New York Attorney General's Office last week issued letters to both Citizens United and Bannon's consulting firm seeking more information. Bannon would receive another $150,000 in fees after the Mercer Family Foundation donated $1 million to the Citizens United Foundation in 2013. In its annual filing to the IRS for that year, Citizens United described the $150,000 as a payment for both film consulting and fundraising, and the group's auditors listed $150,000 as the group's spending on fundraising. Other money flowed to Bannon for new political documentaries. Working with Citizens United, he was the writer, director and producer of "The Hope & The Change," an examination of Democrats disaffected with Obama, and "Occupy Unmasked," a salvo aimed at the political left and Wall Street protesters. That same year, Bannon collaborated with a conservative charity, Judicial Watch, on a film called "District of Corruption," a critique of the Obama administration and the money flooding into Washington. Judicial Watch, which describes itself as an accountability-oversight group, paid Bannon's Victory Film Project $382,143, documents show. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s chief strategist, claims he turned his Breitbart News website into the "go-to platform" of the alt-right, a fringe brand of conservatism. Here are a few terms the alt-right uses. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s chief strategist, claims he turned his Breitbart News website into the "go-to platform" of the alt-right, a fringe brand of conservatism. Here are a few terms the alt-right uses. In March 2012, Bannon formed his own nonprofit group, the GAI. In filings with the IRS seeking tax-exempt status he said it would operate as an "educational charity" to promote "economic freedom" and seek to expose corruption. Such groups are known as 501(c)(3) charities, a title related to a section of the tax code they fall under. The GAI was based in Tallahassee. Bannon served as chairman and executive director, earning an estimated $100,000 annually, documents show. His colleague, Schweizer, served as president and received an estimated $200,000. Robinson, named as a GAI director, was unpaid, the document shows. Bannon, Schweizer and Robinson were linked through nonprofit organizations and filmmaking work. Bannon and Schweizer had made the film about President Ronald Reagan together in 2004; more recently, they were colleagues at Breitbart News. Schweizer sat on the board of Robinson's Young America's Foundation, which had paid Bannon $404,904 to produce films in 2010 and 2011, documents show, and would pay him almost $173,000 in 2012. In the document seeking tax-exempt status for the GAI, Bannon signed a document under penalty of perjury repeatedly attesting that each of them "has no family or business relationships with any other persons involved with GAI." A GAI spokeswoman told The Post that the relationships were later disclosed in the group's annual filing with the IRS - submitted in November 2013, nine months after the GAI's tax-exempt status was approved. Charities are required to disclose business relationships among their directors on their initial applications for tax exemption so that the IRS can examine whether the organization is being formed for a proper public purpose. Robinson told The Post that he had not seen the application. "I do not know the definition of 'business relationship,' " he said. "That is an issue to take up with those who prepared it."

President-elect Trump has named Bannon as a chief strategist and senior counselor. The GAI would only have a relative handful of donors in the coming years. Its first $2 million infusion of cash came from another conservative charity. The Mercer Family Foundation and Donor's Trust, a conservative nonprofit group tied to the wealthy Koch brothers, would donate more than $7 million to the GAI over the following three years, documents show. A spokeswoman for the GAI previously told The Post the organization "is and always has been in total compliance with all 501(c)3 rules." She also said that the group has a "bipartisan track record of working with top investigative units in media on award-winning reports." Early on March 19, 2012, the same day that the IRS accepted the GAI application, Bannon took on yet another leadership role: He was named the executive chairman of Breitbart News, filling the void left by the unexpected death of Andrew Breitbart earlier that month. Wickstrom, the CFO of ARC Entertainment, said he was with Bannon on a business trip in New York when Bannon got the call that Breitbart had died. Bannon spent the day on the phone, he said. "He felt very much responsible for [Breitbart News]," Wickstrom said. Bannon immediately began to expand Breitbart's reach while also working with Schweizer and others to put the GAI on the political and journalistic map. In February 2013, Bannon said on a rental application that the Mercer-backed Breitbart News was paying him $62,500 per month, the equivalent of $750,000 a year. He also reported receiving $377,000 in pay between 2012 and 2015 from the GAI for working an average of 30 hours per week. In 2014 and 2015, Bannon took on additional paid positions in two Mercer-backed companies that were positioning themselves to play a role in the 2016 presidential election. Bannon became a vice president of Cambridge Analytica, a data-science firm, in June 2014. With Rebekah Mercer, he also co-founded another film-production firm called Glittering Steel LLC and became its chairman, documents show. Through it all, Bannon was managing Breitbart's 24/7 news operation and also hosted a radio program. Bannon often highlighted the GAI's work and invited its employees as guests on his show. As chairman of the GAI, Bannon approved spending more than $200,000 on advertising on Breitbart News's website, according to disclosures that the charity submitted to the IRS. Bannon also was maintaining ties to Bossie from Citizens United, and often invited Bossie onto his Breitbart News radio program. In 2015, the GAI also gave $125,000 to Citizens United Foundation, calling the donation "general public assistance." Citizens United and Bannon's Glittering Steel produced his 2016 "Torchbearer," featuring "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson, a film that Breitbart News said was a "clarion call for Christians and people of faith in America to engage their culture before it's too late." The first and last time I ever saw Stephen K. Bannon was last May at the Cannes Film Festival, where his film "Clinton Cash" was screening for overseas buyers. The documentary, a strategically timed takedown of Hillary Clinton centering on her alleged ethical lapses and dubious financial dealings,... The first and last time I ever saw Stephen K. Bannon was last May at the Cannes Film Festival, where his film "Clinton Cash" was screening for overseas buyers. The documentary, a strategically timed takedown of Hillary Clinton centering on her alleged ethical lapses and dubious financial dealings,... The efforts of Bannon's network culminated with release of "Clinton Cash," the book Schweizer wrote using researchers from the GAI. Bannon, Schweizer and others turned it into a movie with the help of Glittering Steel, which paid Bannon $167,500 in 2016, documents show. Bannon promoted the movie in the run-up to the presidential election. He invited Schweizer onto his radio program on April 29, 2016, to discuss the Clintons. "What is it about the permanent political class and how they're stealing from the audience that listens to this show and goes to Breitbart every day?" Bannon asked. Schweizer responded, "I mean, this film and 'Clinton Cash' . . . it's not a book about stuff that's happening in the abstract. It's about how a political class of leaders, personified by the Clintons . . . are systematically selling out the interests of the country for personal profit." On July 20, 2016, as the campaign was going into overdrive, Bannon again had Schweizer on Breitbart News's SiriusXM radio program, broadcast from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "These people are corrupt," Bannon said. "They are corrupt from stem to stern." Less than a month later, Bannon became the chief executive of Trump's campaign. Bossie, of Citizens United, joined as his deputy.

On Saturday, an aide to President Donald Trump took to Twitter to denounce a renegade House Republican and encouraged other Republicans to defeat the wayward lawmaker in a GOP primary next year. On Monday, liberal advocacy groups plan to deliver a petition to the political arm of Senate Democrats denouncing a pair of Democratic incumbents who intend to break ranks next week to support Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The groups plan to demand that Democrats refrain from spending any funds to re-elect Sens. Joe Manchin (W. Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), more conservative Democrats whose presence in their seats are the best defense against ceding them to Republicans. A little over two months into Donald Trump's presidency, Washington is experiencing fierce civil wars on either end of the ideological spectrum - an extraordinary development that has created a political climate unlike any in recent memory. Both Republicans and Democrats, reeling from different forms of defeat, have turned on their own in an attempt to punish those members of their party who don't conform to the prevailing orthodoxy on the biggest issues of the day. Outside political groups and President Trump himself have issued threats to these transgressors -- and, in at least one case, a conservative group has actually withdrawn advertising and on-the-ground resources aiding a GOP lawmaker. When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan pulled the plug on the GOP’s Obamcacare overhaul, lawmakers spilled out of the Capitol basement, angry, frustrated and stunned. But Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), leader of the conservative and rebellious House Freedom Caucus that led the fight against the bill, was... When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan pulled the plug on the GOP’s Obamcacare overhaul, lawmakers spilled out of the Capitol basement, angry, frustrated and stunned. But Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), leader of the conservative and rebellious House Freedom Caucus that led the fight against the bill, was... The casualty of the nonstop infighting is a lack of focus on the political middle ground where elections are won and where legislation must be forged in order to win enough votes to be enacted. Normally, the losing party spends many months after a presidential election in a soul-searching mission aimed at figuring out what went wrong, usually prompting a debate about whether to try and appeal more to centrists or seek further ideological purity aimed at turning out more base voters in the next election. Yet the 2016 election and its aftermath have increased tensions across the political spectrum, heightening the establishment versus anti-establishment feud in Republican circles and sparking a new wave of fury within Democratic ranks. The House's implosion on the health-care debate in late March and the Senate's debate over Gorsuch's nomination crystallize those internal wars. The president, according to Dan Scavino Jr.'s tweet, "is bringing auto jobs & plants back to Michigan. @justinamash is a liability." Scavino is the director of White House social media and a senior adviser to Trump, a role that would usually mean keeping a low profile and not issuing threats against a fellow Republican like Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.). Amash was part of the conservative House Freedom Caucus that helped take down the legislation that would have repealed some of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replaced it with a complex system of tax credits, which was supported by Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). Scavino issued a final edict to his 385,000 followers on Twitter on Saturday, about how to handle Amash: "Defeat him in primary." This followed several days of angry tweets from Trump himself, warning Freedom Caucus members to "get on the team" or else he would "fight" them, a seeming reference to primary challenges next year. The president singled out Amash and Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, by name for their recalcitrant ways. President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... President Donald Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence. His attack - starting with a tweet... Trump is getting his first experience with GOP infighting that has vexed Ryan and his predecessor, former speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, since Republicans won the House majority in the 2010 midterms. But it's not just far-right Republicans under political fire. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by allies of Ryan, pulled its ad campaign in support of Rep. David Young, R-Iowa, when he announced that the health legislation tilted too far to the right and would leave too many constituents without insurance in his middle-of-the-road district. The PAC had already placed a staffer on the ground in Des Moines, Iowa, to begin collecting data to help Young in his re-election race. The staffer was called home. The feuding has left Trump's entire agenda up in the air, as the issues ahead, particularly an overhaul of the entire tax code, are just as complex as overhauling the health-care industry. In normal times, one option would be to turn to Democrats for support, but, as Gorsuch's confirmation battle demonstrates, these are not normal times and almost no Democrat is willing to work with the president out of fear that liberal anti-Trump activists will take out their anger on them. One of Senate’s most serious jobs – confirming the president’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court – has devolved into a game of political chicken. Senators are heading toward an institution-defining showdown next week as Democrats promise to try to block President Trump’s nominee,... One of Senate’s most serious jobs – confirming the president’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court – has devolved into a game of political chicken. Senators are heading toward an institution-defining showdown next week as Democrats promise to try to block President Trump’s nominee,... Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has declared that he will round up enough votes to keep Gorsuch under the 60-vote threshold needed to choke off a filibuster. He told The Washington Post last week that it was "virtually impossible" for any senators to broker a last-minute deal to avoid that result, which will then prompt Republicans to change Senate rules on a party-line vote to end super-majority requirements for Supreme Court justices. So far, just Manchin and Heitkamp, from states that Trump won last year by more than 35 percentage points, have joined all 52 Republicans in supporting Gorsuch. The result is that a dozen liberal groups are rounding up signatures to try to prevent the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from supporting the senators. It could be a self-defeating move for Democrats: both Manchin and Heitkamp are widely considered the only possible members of their party who might be able to win in those deeply conservative states. One member of this coalition, We Will Replace You, is a new super PAC with a central goal of funding primary opponents against Democrats who make any positive overtures toward Trump. "The next crucial step is escalating our demands, and demonstrating that we won't accept anything less than full opposition," its mission statement says. Schumer has repeatedly said he would work with Trump if the president moved to the middle. Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current... Democrats in Congress have a new and somewhat surprising tool at their disposal in the era of one-party Republican rule in President Donald Trump's Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current... Yet the Democratic leader told The Post last week that, in a meeting with Trump earlier this year, Schumer told the president that his party would oppose all 21 names on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Schumer said, however, that he has not offered the president a single name of a candidate who would not be the victim of Democratic obstruction. One Democrat, Sen. Chris Coons (Del.), made a slight effort to try to find a compromise on Gorsuch. But the effort was immediately pilloried by liberal groups demanding a filibuster. The talks collapsed, in a fashion that sums up much of the current state of Washington. "There is not a lot of common ground and trust to work on, but I'm open to anyone who's got a reasonable suggestion," Coons said last week.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats to reach out to President Donald Trump's supporters to promote a progressive agenda that includes guaranteed health care for all Americans as part of a strategy to rebuild the party. Sanders told a boisterous crowd Tuesday night in Louisville that Trump has reneged on his promises to working-class voters. He said Democrats should reach out to disillusioned Trump supporters as the out-of-power party tries to recover from last year's election losses. "You don't stand with the working people of this country by supporting health care legislation that throws 24 million people off of health insurance," former presidential candidate Sanders said of the languishing health care overhaul backed by Trump. Sanders and Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez took their nationwide tour to Kentucky, where downtrodden Democrats saw their series of election losses mount last November when Republicans claimed the state House. Trump won 118 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Democrats who once dominated Kentucky politics have since lost the governor's mansion and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. Republicans hold both U.S. Senate seats and all but one of the state's U.S. House seats. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, called for a grass-roots resurgence in which progressives run for offices ranging from local school board to Congress. He said the party's strategy should include building a strong base in all 50 states, not just on both coasts. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez. "Real change ... never, ever takes place from the top on down," he said. "It is always from the bottom on up." Sanders and Perez are seeking to jump-start grass-roots opposition to Trump by focusing on such issues as raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the state's only Democratic congressman, spoke in favor of a "single-payer" health care system, drawing sustained applause from the crowd. Yarmuth, who represents a Louisville-area district, said the "single-player" plan would loom as the biggest advantage that Democrats would have in next year's election if the national party embraces it. Touching on a vital issue to Kentucky's coalfields, Sanders embraced legislation to protect health care and pension benefits for tens of thousands of retired coal miners. Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained roars of approval from a friendly crowd on Monday as he called for a radical transformation of the Democratic Party into a grassroots movement founded on the tenets of his unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign: fighting against the billionaire... Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders gained roars of approval from a friendly crowd on Monday as he called for a radical transformation of the Democratic Party into a grassroots movement founded on the tenets of his unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign: fighting against the billionaire... He ventured into a politically volatile issue in coal-friendly Kentucky by noting that scientists are "virtually unanimous" in saying climate change is real and caused by human activity. Sanders endorsed efforts to transform energy policies away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy sources. "But when we do that, we do not forget about the people who kept the lights on for decades," he said. Sanders said he supports legislation that would rebuild coal-based communities hurt by the decline of coal. Earlier in the day, Sanders met with six Kentuckians at a Frankfort coffee shop. Sanders told reporters he did not come to Kentucky "to convince anybody," but said it was "absurd" that Kentucky's elected officials, including the Senate Majority Leader McConnell, would push so hard for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The act has resulted in more than 400,000 people getting health insurance through an expanded Medicaid program in Kentucky. "I suspect that the Democratic Party here in Kentucky has not done the kind of job that it should have done," Sanders said. "It's an investment. If people are getting health care, it's an investment." Most Kentucky Democrats have tried to distance themselves from the Affordable Care Act, mostly because of its association with former President Barack Obama. The exception has been former Gov. Steve Beshear, who embraced the law and delivered the Democratic response to Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress earlier this year. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said Kentucky can't afford to keep the Affordable Care Act, which will cost taxpayers an extra $257 million in the state's most recent spending plan. "Kentuckians have roundly rejected the ultra-liberal, anti-jobs platform of coastal elites like Sanders and Perez," Kentucky Republican Party spokesman Tres Watson said.

After a string of televised debates, four party-sponsored "future forums" and three months of person-to-person lobbying, the race to lead the Democratic National Committee is coming to an end - with a vote on Saturday that might leave Democrats with new divisions. According to multiple campaigns, former labor secretary Thomas Perez has the largest share of the DNC's 447 voting members ready to support him. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., was running behind him. In the last week, both were endorsed by rivals who were seen to have a few dozen votes between them; before that, Perez claimed to be just 44 votes away from victory. "We're bringing that black and brown coalition together, y'all," said South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday morning during a Black History Month breakfast event where he reiterated his endorsement of Perez. The next DNC chairman will take over a party financially drained by the 2016 election but cheered by protests galvanized on a near-daily basis by an unpopular Republican president. The chairman needs to rebuild a bench that was decimated by the 2010 and 2014 midterms, with races in 2017 and 2018 giving the party its last chance, for a decade, to take power in states where gerrymandering of House district boundaries has built a powerful House GOP majority. There is also, of course, the 2020 presidential election and the lack of a clear field to challenge Trump. Some Democrats, who increasingly see Perez as the next chairman, are bracing for protests no matter who wins. Progressive news outlets have attacked Perez as a stalking horse for the party's establishment; some prominent donors have said that Ellison, who would be the first Muslim chairman of a major political party, has been too critical of Israel. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of Ellison's earliest backers, said in a letter distributed by the Ellison campaign that he trusts the congressman on Israel and as a fighter against anti-Semitism. But a race that began with multiple Democratic leaders endorsing Ellison, who was encouraged to run by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has revealed the limits of "Berniecrats" inside the party structure. Supporters of Ellison and Perez have acknowledged that a victory for Perez would come with a backlash from the left. Just days before Democratic activists pick a new party chair, the contest to head the Democratic National Committee remains fluid, as national leaders grapple with how to turn an outpouring of liberal protest against President Donald Trump into political gains. A tight race between front-runners... Just days before Democratic activists pick a new party chair, the contest to head the Democratic National Committee remains fluid, as national leaders grapple with how to turn an outpouring of liberal protest against President Donald Trump into political gains. A tight race between front-runners... "It would be a challenge, especially in states where Bernie did well," said Brandon Dillon, the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party and an Ellison supporter. "It would definitely lead to some conversations with people who are just now getting involved with the party," said Deborah Langhoff, a DNC member from Louisiana who endorsed Perez. On policy and on their prescriptions for the party, Perez and Ellison have few substantive differences. Ellison has taken pains in public forums to say that Perez was "an ally" in former President Barack Obama's administration; both men have promised to pour resources into state and territorial Democratic parties, reversing what was seen as a trend toward centralization during the Obama years. But outside of the DNC, progressive writers and organizers have begun to ring alarms about an Ellison defeat. On Friday morning, a number of groups that had endorsed Ellison, including MoveOn.org, 350 Action and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, asked DNC members "to be heroes" and back the congressman's campaign. "If Keith Ellison is DNC Chair, we can hit the ground running - and because of the pre-existing trust that exists between Keith and the grassroots, every state party would have a head start harnessing the power of the resistance," they wrote. On Thursday and Friday, The New Republic and The Intercept published long pieces asking why Perez needed to run in the first place, highlighting the criticism of Ellison from donors. "If the plan to sink Ellison succeeds, the message that will be heard - fairly or not - is that the Democratic Party continues to venerate loyalty to its oligarchical donors above all else," wrote The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald. Ellison himself has avoided that tone - and has discouraged supporters from lobbying DNC members. In 2016, many DNC members, who enjoyed superdelegate status at the party's convention, were deluged by Sanders supporters. While Sanders has called some DNC members on Ellison's behalf, the senator has warned supporters - sometimes in vain - not to repeat the unsuccessful email and phone-call lobbying of 2016. "When I see some of the emails, I just ignore them," Tony Coelho, a former California congressman who was one of the party's best high-dollar fundraisers, and who is now a Perez-supporting DNC member. "When they call, you know who it is, because they don't leave voice mail." While Sanders supporters have won party leadership positions since the senator's campaign ended, most of the DNC's membership backed Hillary Clinton for president. There were cheers on Friday morning when the former secretary of state appeared in a video message, saying that "ideas we championed are now inspiring leaders and activists across our country." "Whoever wins - and I really hope it's Keith - will have a huge responsibility of healing, motivating and activating people," said American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, who backed Clinton for president. A third DNC candidate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, spent Friday hoping that Democrats would dodge a backlash by deadlocking and then giving him a chance. At a lunch for supporters, Buttigieg estimated that he had around 30 votes, and told reporters that scores of DNC members have told him he was their second choice if the race dragged on. That assessment was echoed by Buttigieg's highest-profile supporter - former presidential candidate and DNC chairman Howard Dean. At the lunch, Dean described Buttigieg as the candidate who could lead a "50-year strategy" for the party (a contrast with Dean's own "50-state strategy"), and went further than any candidate in criticizing party leadership. "I don't want to say anything bad about the other candidates, because I like them all, but I think Chuck Schumer's endorsement is the kiss of death," Dean said. "I had to say no to Chuck Schumer when he demanded $5 million. I said, 'Chuck, you're not getting it for the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]' - I'm putting it into local races in Maryland, and South Carolina, and Michigan!" Dean shouted the last words, making a joke out of the infamous speech he gave after losing the 2004 Iowa caucuses. Asked about the remarks, spokesmen for Schumer and Ellison declined to comment. And in the hallway outside of the lunch, Dean's brother Jim, who led the progressive group Democracy for America, was offering green "Keith for DNC" shirts to anyone who walked by.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made last bids for support in Michigan's Democratic primary Tuesday, with both arguing they would be able to navigate the gridlock in Washington that's spawned anger among voters of both political parties. In back-to-back appearances at a town hall hosted by Fox News in Detroit, the two candidates picked up where they left off after Sunday's debate in Flint, Mich., answering questions on the economy, national security, abortion rights, education and working with Republicans. For the most part, Clinton and Sanders passed over questions designed to pit them against each other. Asked whether he's more trustworthy than Clinton, Sanders said, "I will let the people of the United States make that decision." Clinton, asked whether she views Sanders as an opponent or an ally, called the Vermont senator an ally. "If I am so fortunate, I hope to work with him because the issues he has raised, the passion he has demonstrated, the people he has attracted are going to be very important in the general election, but equally following the election to try to get things done," she said. Asked if he would be willing to become Clinton's running mate, Sanders said he is "talking about running this campaign to win." Clinton said she was focused on the Michigan primary, not who her running mate might be. Sanders is running out of opportunities to challenge Clinton's lead in the Democratic presidential race. She is already half-way to winning enough delegates to secure the nomination. That means Sanders needs a major score in the next round of delegate-rich primaries: Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi and contests one week later in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. As Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debated about the auto bailout, Sanders interrupted Clinton, saying, "Excuse me, I'm talking." March 6, 2016. (AP) As Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debated about the auto bailout, Sanders interrupted Clinton, saying, "Excuse me, I'm talking." March 6, 2016. (AP) Sanders is emphasizing his opposition to free-trade accords that he says have led to the decline of manufacturing jobs, a potentially potent issue in the state that is home to the U.S. auto industry. "One of the strong differences of opinion that Secretary Clinton and I have, I have helped lead the opposition against every one of these terrible trade programs," Sanders said. "I don't believe American workers should be forced to compete against desperate people around the world who are making pennies an hour." Anticipating that line of attack, Clinton took Sanders by surprise during CNN's Sunday night debate when she criticized him for voting against the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bailout of the financial industry that also provided $85 billion in relief to the automobile industry. "I voted to save the auto industry," Clinton said Sunday. "He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference." Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for president. On Monday, Sanders was on the offensive, telling an audience in Kalamazoo, Mich., that Clinton "went out of her way to mischaracterize" his vote. Sanders said he voted for the auto bailout when it came before the Senate as a separate bill that ultimately failed, and later voted against TARP. The senator has said Clinton's comments on the auto bailout are an attempt to distract from her past support for various trade deals and Wall Street. Michigan is a crucial state for Sanders, who is fighting a growing perception that his campaign is more about pushing his agenda than actually winning the nomination. Despite winning caucuses in Kansas, Nebraska and Maine over the weekend, Sanders has yet to win a large, delegate-rich state. There are 130 delegates up for grabs in Michigan. After a series of victories, including eight Super Tuesday contests, Clinton leads Sanders by almost 200 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses. When super delegates party members who are free to chose who they will support are taken into account, Clinton has 1,130 of the 2,383 needed to win the nomination, compared with 499 for Sanders, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Sanders has hoped that his opposition to trade deals will resonate with the Michigan's blue collar workers. According to a Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic primary voters in the state released Monday, Clinton leads Sanders by 13 points, 55 percent to 42 percent. The two Democrats also are scheduled to take part in a debate Wednesday in Florida. Bloomberg

President Barack Obama is traveling to the Capitol to give congressional Democrats advice on how to combat the Republican drive to dismantle his health care overhaul. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is meeting with GOP lawmakers to discuss the best way to send Obama's cherished law to its graveyard and replace it with — well, something. The separate strategy sessions were coming on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress. In 16 days, Republican Donald Trump replaces Obama at the White House, putting the party's longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach. Plenty of questions remain, including the repeal bill's details, costs and when it would take effect. Republicans also face divisions over the next step — replacement legislation — that will likely take months or years to resolve. While they can hardly prevent the GOP repeal effort from proceeding, the president and House and Senate Democrats were meeting Wednesday to discuss how to best defend a law that's extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans and which Obama considers one of the proudest pillars of his legacy. Congressional Republicans, despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act, are struggling with what parts of the law to roll back and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate, to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... Congressional Republicans, despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act, are struggling with what parts of the law to roll back and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate, to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... "The more the people understand what's included in the Affordable Care Act and how they benefit from it, the more popular the program is, and the harder it is for Republicans to have political support for tearing it down," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday, using the law's formal name. "The president's message to them is that they should be out there telling the stories of their constituents who are benefiting from this law," Earnest said. "I think that's certainly the most important thing they can do." Pence was meeting Wednesday morning with House Republicans to discuss their health care drive and planned to attend a lunch with Senate Republicans. Republicans eager to show quick action against Obama's health care law took an initial procedural step Tuesday, introducing a budget bill that would have to be considered under a parliamentary procedure that would prevent Democrats from using a Senate filibuster to protect the health care law. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin, but it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, a procedural roadblock that can kill legislation. Democratic congressional leaders and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have called for a Jan. 15 "Day of Action" to oppose any cuts to health-care plans or subsidies from the incoming Trump administration, the latest example of the Vermont senator pushing his (briefly) adopted party toward more activism. Democratic congressional leaders and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have called for a Jan. 15 "Day of Action" to oppose any cuts to health-care plans or subsidies from the incoming Trump administration, the latest example of the Vermont senator pushing his (briefly) adopted party toward more activism. The Senate was expected to complete the budget by next week. House approval would follow. "This is the first step toward relief for Americans struggling under Obamacare," said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The budget legislation gives congressional committees until Jan. 27 — a blink of an eye for lawmakers — to write legislation repealing major parts of the health care law. Likely targets include the law's tax penalties for people who don't obtain insurance, its requirement that many companies cover workers and tax increases on higher-earning individuals and many health care firms. Aware they have no chance of quickly agreeing on replacement legislation, Republicans plan to delay when their repeal would actually take effect. A range of 18 months to three years — perhaps longer — has been under discussion. Trump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage. As they race to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act, President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are leaving behind nearly everyone but their base voters and a handful of conservative activists. Not a single major organization representing patients, physicians, hospitals... As they race to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act, President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are leaving behind nearly everyone but their base voters and a handful of conservative activists. Not a single major organization representing patients, physicians, hospitals... Republicans don't want to abruptly end health care coverage for millions of voters who live in GOP-represented districts and states, or cause chaos in health care markets and prompt insurance companies to stop selling policies. So they are considering including provisions in their repeal bill to protect consumers and insurers during the transition period. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., a member of the GOP Senate leadership, said that could include money to temporarily continue helping people afford to buy coverage and language letting the Department of Health and Human Services help stabilize insurance markets. "Everyone realizes there's going to have to be a phase-in, phase-out period," Thune said Tuesday. Underscoring one challenge facing Republicans, a report Wednesday from a nonpartisan anti-deficit group estimated that repealing the health care law entirely would add to federal deficits, and that replacement legislation would require significant funding. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis found that complete repeal would add up to $350 billion to federal deficits over a decade. That's because the Medicare cuts and tax increases used to finance Obama's law exceed the amount of money spent to expand the breadth of coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in December 2015 that an earlier bill repealing much but not all of Obama's law would save around $300 billion over 10 years. Obama vetoed that bill. Associated Press

President Donald Trump nears the 100-day mark of his administration as the least popular chief executive in modern times, a president whose voters remain largely satisfied with his performance, but one whose base of support has not expanded since he took the oath of office, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Trump's first months in office have produced some tangible successes. Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U.S. companies to keep jobs in this country. Those who say the economy is getting better outnumber those who say it's getting worse by the biggest margin in 15 years in Post-ABC polling. But the president's balance sheet overall tilts toward the negative. Majorities of Americans say Trump has not accomplished much during his first months as president. Meanwhile, he shows little improvement on his temperament and honesty, and while he has gained ground on empathy, more than 6 in 10 still say he does not understand the problems of people like them. With a week remaining before his 100th day in office, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative accomplishment, having been dealt a major setback when Republicans in Congress decided not to proceed with a vote on a health-care bill supported by the White House. His clearest achievement is the successful nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Executive actions on trade, immigration, climate and government organization have pointed the direction Trump wants to take the country, though his controversial proposed entry ban that affects a number of Muslim-majority nations remains blocked by the courts. Trump and others in his administration have attacked the courts, accusing them of overreach, but nearly 6 in 10 people see the courts' actions as a legitimate role for the judicial branch. Overseas, he has demonstrated his willingness to use military force, with targeted strikes in Syria and the use of one of the biggest non-nuclear devices in the U.S. arsenal in Afghanistan. But tensions with North Korea remain high, and the administration's policy in the Middle East remains cloudy. President Donald Trump returned to his populist "America first" message Tuesday, visiting a state key to his presidential victory where he signed an executive order to discourage businesses from hiring low-wage workers abroad and to require the government to buy more from U.S. firms. Appearing... President Donald Trump returned to his populist "America first" message Tuesday, visiting a state key to his presidential victory where he signed an executive order to discourage businesses from hiring low-wage workers abroad and to require the government to buy more from U.S. firms. Appearing... The 100-day marker is an artificial measuring post for any president, but by comparison, Trump has reached this point in his presidency faring worse to much worse than other recent presidents. An electorate that was deeply divided throughout the 2016 campaign remains so today, with opposition seemingly hardened and unyielding on most questions regarding his presidency. The president's approval rating stands at 42 percent, the lowest recorded at this stage of a presidency dating to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump's 53 percent disapproval rating is 14 percentage points higher than Bill Clinton's 39 percent disapproval in April 1993, the worst before Trump. Eight years ago, then-president Barack Obama's approval was 69 percent, his disapproval 26 percent. President Donald Trump managed to get elected without a popular-vote majority and without positive favorable ratings because he successfully stoked Clinton Derangement Syndrome. In retrospect, it's stunning that he managed to convince voters that Hillary Clinton was the more corrupt, dishonest... President Donald Trump managed to get elected without a popular-vote majority and without positive favorable ratings because he successfully stoked Clinton Derangement Syndrome. In retrospect, it's stunning that he managed to convince voters that Hillary Clinton was the more corrupt, dishonest... The Post-ABC poll finds 43 percent of Americans said they strongly disapprove of Trump's performance. That's also the worst by far of any president since George H.W. Bush by more than double. In the spring of 1993, 21 percent said they strongly disapproved of Clinton's performance. Americans split at 35 percent apiece on whether Trump is doing a better or worse job than expected, with the rest saying he's neither above nor below their expectations. There are no signs of major slippage in support among those who voted for Trump. His approval rating among those who cast ballots for him stands at 94 percent. Among Republicans, it is 84 percent. Asked of those who voted for him whether they regret doing so, 2 percent say they do, while 96 percent say supporting Trump was the right thing to do. When asked whether they would vote for him again, 96 percent say they would, which is higher than the 85 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who say they would support her again. Trump is also satisfying the substantial share of the electorate that voted for him with some reservation. Among Trump voters who say they were "somewhat enthusiastic" or less excited about supporting him, 88 percent approve of his current performance, and 79 percent say he understands the problems of people like them. Bill Clinton also had a rocky start to his presidency, which colored public judgments of his presidency by the 100-day mark. Although 42 percent say Trump has accomplished either a great deal or a good amount so far, that is slightly higher than the 37 percent who said the same about Clinton in 1993. Similarly, judgments on whether campaign promises have been kept put Trump on about equal footing with Bill Clinton: 44 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Also, Trump's 53 percent positive rating on strong leadership is almost identical to that of George W. Bush at this point in his presidency, but much lower than Obama's 77 percent rating. Of those who say Trump has not accomplished much, 47 percent pin the blame on him while about a quarter blame congressional Republicans. Seven percent say Democrats are to blame. One of Trump's biggest deficiencies, compared with those of other presidents, is whether he is honest and trustworthy. Fewer than 4 in 10 (38 percent) say he is. At this point in their presidencies, 74 percent said Obama was honest, 62 percent said George W. Bush was honest, and a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed 61 percent said Clinton was honest. Another gap is on the question of whether Trump can be trusted in a crisis. The poll finds that 43 percent - about the same as Trump's approval rating - say he can be trusted; 73 percent said so for Obama and 65 percent for George W. Bush at this point in their presidencies. On the specific question of how Trump has dealt with North Korea, 46 percent say he has been about right in his posture, 37 percent say he is too aggressive and 7 percent say he is too cautious. On most questions about his performance or characteristics, Trump receives more negative than positive ratings. The most notable exception is his effort to pressure U.S. companies on the issues of keeping jobs at home, where 73 percent of Americans approve, including 54 percent of Democrats. Another issue where the public sides with Trump rather than his critics is whether it is a conflict of interest for Trump to spend time at his own properties. A 54 percent majority say he has the right to travel where he wants to go. But on another question, about 6 in 10 Americans say they disapprove of the major White House roles Trump has given to his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Trump has net negative ratings on such questions as temperament - just as he did during the campaign - as well as on judgment to serve as president, and on whether he operates from a consistent set of principles. He has said he likes to be unpredictable. Half disapprove of the major changes he has proposed for government spending, while nearly 6 in 10 say he is out of touch with the concerns of most people. But on this question, the public is even harsher in judging the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Democrats have lost considerable ground on this front. The 28 percent who say the party is in touch with concerns of most Americans is down from 48 percent in 2014 and the biggest drop is among self-identified Democrats, from 83 percent saying they are in touch to 52 percent today. That is a reminder that whatever challenges Trump is having, Democrats, for all the energy apparent at the grass roots, have their own problems. The Post-ABC survey reveals a persistent gender gap, with women generally more negative toward the president than men, including double-digit gaps on Trump's attributes such as honesty and temperament. Just over one-third of women (35 percent) approve of the way he is handling the job of president, compared with 48 percent of men. Even fewer women, 29 percent, say they approve of the changes he is proposing for government spending, compared with 45 percent of men. Despite the public's skepticism of Trump's first 100 days, the survey finds little evidence that voters would render a different verdict from last November, when Trump won key states needed to secure victory in the electoral college despite Clinton winning more votes nationwide. The new survey finds 46 percent saying they voted for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump, similar to her two-point national vote margin. Asked how they would vote if the election were held today, 43 say they would support Trump and 40 percent say Clinton. The Post-ABC poll was conducted April 17-20 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults interviewed on cellular and landline phones. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The Washington Post's Emily Guskin contributed to this report.

Apprentices no more, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are now at the helm of the Trump Organization and adjusting to the reality presented by their father's presidency. They're eyeing ways to use the new lease on the family fame by expanding the brand into parts of the United States that embrace him. Some business has slowed as a result of the pledge to stall international dealmaking while Trump is president. But a U.S. push is planned, and two new hotel chains are being considered — a four-star brand and a less luxurious line — possibly in states where Trump triumphed over Democrat Hillary Clinton last November. "I think it makes it naturally easier if you're going into a place that's not adversarial to you," Donald Trump Jr. said in a recent interview. The Trump Organization is a private, family-run business that owns billions of dollars' worth of hotels, office buildings, golf courses and management and licensing agreements. Although foreign deals are on hold, the company will complete existing projects, including ones in India, the United Arab Emirates and the Dominican Republic. Leaders of a House investigations panel asked the Trump Organization on Friday for specifics on how it will donate its profits from foreign government payments to the U.S. Treasury. Before taking office, President Donald Trump promised to donate profits from foreign governments paying for services... Leaders of a House investigations panel asked the Trump Organization on Friday for specifics on how it will donate its profits from foreign government payments to the U.S. Treasury. Before taking office, President Donald Trump promised to donate profits from foreign governments paying for services... Because overseas markets have been hotter for the Trump brand, the company could lose some new revenue, the president's sons suggested. Last fall, the company announced the creation of a four-star hotel chain called Scion, which is meant to offer upscale service in U.S. cities that could not support a full-fledged Trump luxury property. More than two dozen letters of intent have been signed, though no ground has been broken yet. Among the possible locations being considered: Texas, parts of the South, and perhaps the nation's capital, where the hotel would exist with the Trump luxury property in the former home of the Old Post Office not far from the White House. The company is also in the very early stages of considering a three-star hotel chain. Experts said the plan would not seem to run afoul of any ethics standards, even if the hotels ended up in some of the economically depressed regions whose voters rallied for Trump and may not be able to afford a luxury brand. It would be no different from cashing in on the name of a nonpolitical celebrity, they said. The Trump Organization has settled a legal dispute with a second celebrity chef who backed out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump's hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. The agreement between Trump and famed chef Geoffrey Zakarian, announced Monday by lawyers, comes three days after the Trump...

The agreement between Trump and famed chef Geoffrey Zakarian, announced Monday by lawyers, comes three days after the Trump... Similarly, daughter Ivanka Trump has made a pitch for Trump's blue-collar supporters by replacing her high-end jewelry line with a mass-market brand. "It would not seem to blur any lines with the presidency," said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University. She said that while "questions can be raised" about some of the company's behavior, a pitch into Trump-friendly states seems like "a reasonable business strategy." Any new investment, particularly if it involves foreign funds, will face additional scrutiny, including a review by an in-house and outside ethics counsel, Donald Trump Jr. said. "It's a complicated procedure that changes the dynamic. There are plenty of deals that two years ago or eight years from now, 'Oh, yeah, you can do this,'" he said. "Today, we have to take that much more seriously. There is an optical component that has to be taken into account." During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was one of the most ardent and visible supporters of his father's candidacy.

During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was one of the most ardent and visible supporters of his father's candidacy. The eldest son of Donald Trump traveled nationwide, giving speeches, holding fundraisers and appearing on television to stump for his dad - and even advocating for some... He bristled at the idea that his father ran for president to enrich himself or his family, as some critics contended during the campaign. "He spent $75 million of his own money to run against 17 incredibly seasoned Republican candidates to then go against Hillary Clinton," Donald Trump Jr. said. "No one in their right mind would do that. That's not a good business model! I get it, it sells papers, it creates headlines. But it's ridiculous." Donald Trump Jr. said he barely spoke to his father during his first weeks in office. That changed after the younger Trump's 5-year-old son, Tristan, was hurt in a skiing accident. Eric Trump said he does talk to his father more regularly but insists that any discussions about the family business are limited to broad strokes and adheres to the guidelines the president laid out in January. "We don't talk about the business. At most it's 'How's Turnberry? Turnberry's great,'" Eric Trump said, referring to a Trump golf property in Scotland. He would tell his father, if asked, "A profit or loss in a quarter, that's it." In this Oct. 26, 2016 file photo, Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, gives a thumbs-up as he waits to go on a live television interview outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington. In this Oct. 26, 2016 file photo, Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, gives a thumbs-up as he waits to go on a live television interview outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington. "That doesn't talk about any business sectors, that doesn't talk about any assets, that doesn't talk about anything specific in the business. That is a pure number, one number on a piece of paper," Eric Trump said. "That's more than permissible. None of these laws even apply to him — he's the president — but that is more than permissible in a trust structure." Experts disagree, noting that it is not a true trust structure because Trump retained ownership of the company. "As long as President Trump insists on owning the Trump Organization, the conflicts of interest that may occur run directly to him and the so-called firewall plays no role in preventing them," said Fred Wertheimer, head of the ethics watchdog group Democracy 21. "It's an illusion and does not protect the American people." Both Eric and Donald Trump Jr. said they missed their father's presence. Eric Trump said he sometimes looks upon the stack of $1 bills that he won during a series of friendly business bets with his father. Twenty-four hours before taking the oath of office, President Trump strutted into the presidential ballroom of the Trump International Hotel to toast congressional leaders, top donors and the people he had picked to fill out his Cabinet. Trump joked that “a total genius must have built this place,”...

The elder Trump would use the bills, or a newspaper clipping about a Trump property, as a means of communicating to his sons, and his trademark scrawl would carry his congratulations — or his wishes — to those he was training to someday lead his company. "It was his way of saying 'Get this done' or 'Great job, ET - this is going to be amazing,'" said Eric Trump. "It's a simple way of communicating but I learned a lot. I miss that."

When the president-elect's son Eric Trump jetted to Uruguay in early January for a Trump Organization promotional trip, U.S. taxpayers were left footing a bill of nearly $100,000 in hotel rooms for Secret Service and embassy staff. It was a high-profile jaunt out of the country for Eric, the fresh-faced executive of the Trump Organization who, like his father, pledged to keep the company separate from the presidency. Eric mingled with real estate brokers, dined at an open-air beachfront eatery and spoke to hundreds at an "ultra exclusive" Trump Tower Punta del Este evening party celebrating his visit. The Uruguayan trip shows how the government is unavoidably entangled with the Trump company as a result of the president's refusal to divest his ownership stake. In this case, government agencies are forced to pay to support business operations that ultimately help to enrich the president himself. Though the Trumps have pledged a division of business and government, they will nevertheless depend on the publicly funded protection granted to the first family as they travel the globe promoting their brand. A spokeswoman for Eric Trump declined to make him available for an interview and did not provide answers to a list of detailed questions about the trip. Before taking office, President Trump promised to place his assets in a trust designed to erect a wall between him and the businesses that made him wealthy. But newly released documents show that Trump himself is the sole beneficiary of the trust and it is legally controlled by his oldest son and... Before taking office, President Trump promised to place his assets in a trust designed to erect a wall between him and the businesses that made him wealthy. But newly released documents show that Trump himself is the sole beneficiary of the trust and it is legally controlled by his oldest son and... Eric Trump's trip in early January to the coastal resort town appeared to be brief - perhaps as short as two nights, according to a review of local press clips and social media. The bill for the Secret Service's hotel rooms in Uruguay totaled $88,320. The U.S. Embassy in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay, paid an additional $9,510 for its staff to stay in hotel rooms to "support" the Secret Service detail for the "VIP visit," according to purchasing orders reviewed by The Washington Post. "This is an example of the blurring of the line between the personal interest in the family business and the government," said Kathleen Clark, an expert on government ethics and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Despite the use of public funds, government agencies would not provide key details connected to the trip, including the duration of the stay, the name of the hotel or the number of booked rooms. A spokesman from the Secret Service, citing security concerns, declined to comment. Before Christmas, Eric Trump said he planned to "suspend" his charitable foundation, ceasing all its fundraising, while his father was president. "No new money will come into the ETF bank account," Eric Trump said then, referring to the Eric Trump Foundation. The aim was to prevent the appearance... Before Christmas, Eric Trump said he planned to "suspend" his charitable foundation, ceasing all its fundraising, while his father was president. "No new money will come into the ETF bank account," Eric Trump said then, referring to the Eric Trump Foundation. The aim was to prevent the appearance... The money for the hotel rooms was paid through the State Department, but a spokesman there declined to comment on the trip. She instead referred reporters to the White House and back to the Secret Service, whose spokesman once again declined to comment. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment. "There is a public benefit to providing Secret Service protection," Clark said. "But what was the public benefit from State Department personnel participating in this private business trip to the coastal town? It raises the specter of the use of public resources for private gain." Immediate family members of presidents have for decades been guaranteed taxpayer-funded safeguards, and their safety is paramount to national security, especially as they travel to foreign and potentially dangerous hot spots. In 1917, Congress first authorized the then-Secret Service Division of the U.S. Treasury Department to protect the immediate family of the president. In 1984, a statute extended that protection for other key individuals, including the immediate family of the vice president. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton even authorized Secret Service protection for their adult daughters for an unspecified period of time after the presidents left office. "The Secret Service does not have an option as to when it is, where it is, nor as to how much it costs, and whether it's domestic or international," said W. Ralph Basham, former director of the service. "Think about the consequences of something happening to one of the children. The security of it outweighs the expenses of it." Amid controversy over President Trump’s refusal to divest himself from his business interests, the head of his hotel management company hinted at plans to more than triple its domestic hotel operations over the next few years. Eric Danziger, chief executive of Trump Hotels, said he would like to...

Eric Danziger, chief executive of Trump Hotels, said he would like to... While Eric Trump was in Uruguay, the full presence of U.S. security operations did not go unnoticed by the local media and paparazzi. La Nación, an Argentine publication, began its article about the visit with a scene-setter describing two Secret Service agents inside the Punta del Este showroom. Four more agents tried, unsuccessfully, to blend in with the crowd of real estate buyers outside, La Nación wrote. A local photographer encountered Eric Trump at La Huella, a restaurant described as the "ultimate in chic beach eating" and renowned for its grilled seafood entrees. "He had lunch there for about an hour and a half with some friends and acquaintances," photographer Cristian Cordoba said in an email to The Post. "Secret Service was very close by monitoring. He was very kind and courteous with everyone that wanted to say hi to him. He even shook my hand after I took his picture. He said he loved the food and the place and would love to come back." A well-known pop singer from Argentina, Maxi Trusso, performed at the Punta del Este party honoring Eric Trump. Trusso later told the local press that he wrote a song about Donald Trump at Eric's request. Trusso titled the composition "Free and Stronger." He also said that he was invited to sing at the inauguration but declined the offer. A liberal watchdog group says it plans to file a lawsuit against President Donald Trump in federal court on Monday, alleging that he is violating a little-known constitutional provision that bars him from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments.

A liberal watchdog group says it plans to file a lawsuit against President Donald Trump in federal court on Monday, alleging that he is violating a little-known constitutional provision that bars him from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. The group, Citizens for Responsibility... The Trumps, who do not own the Punta del Este project, licensed their name to its developers, who have paid Trump's company between $100,000 and $1 million, according to Trump's financial disclosure filing in May. The 26-story tower is under construction. Its condos - which start at $550,000 and climb to $8 million - are expected to be finished in late 2018. Tower advertisements list amenities including waterfall pools, a massage room and a private theater. The developer, YY Development Group, did not respond to requests for comment. But the chief executive, Juan Jose Cugliandolo, told the Associated Press last month that two-thirds of the condos were sold. Cugliandolo said of Eric Trump's trip, "It honors us that he would come this summer, days before his father takes office," the Associated Press reported. During an interview on the trip, Eric Trump fielded questions from the local media about political issues, including the president of Argentina and how his policies had affected the Trump property in Uruguay. "I don't speak politics," he said, according to a video of the interview. "It's not my world. I'm a business guy." But the reporter pressed again, and Eric Trump said that he had a favorable opinion of Argentina's president for "opening up the country," which had helped business and helped the economy of Uruguay and Argentina. He was also asked about his father and if he would ever join the administration. Eric Trump told La Nación that the relationship between the Trump Organization and his father's administration would be completely separate, like "church and state." President Donald Trump's real estate and merchandising business filed paperwork in Florida Monday removing Trump as an officer in various corporate entities, a sign that he is following through on his pledge to shift away from managing his businesses during his time in the White House.

President Donald Trump's real estate and merchandising business filed paperwork in Florida Monday removing Trump as an officer in various corporate entities, a sign that he is following through on his pledge to shift away from managing his businesses during his time in the White House. Trump's... But ethical experts say that the steps Donald Trump announced to facilitate such a separation, including placing his business into a trust overseen by Eric, Donald Trump Jr. and a longtime company executive, are not enough to eliminate concerns about conflicts of interest. "Having refused to sever his own personal financial interests, [the president] is now sending his emissaries, his sons, out to line his own pockets, and he's subsidizing that activity with taxpayer dollars," said Norm Eisen, a former President Barack Obama administration ethics adviser who is part of a lawsuit accusing Trump of violating a constitutional provision barring presidents from taking payments from foreign governments. It is unusual, although not unprecedented, for trips of presidential family members to focus on the development of private moneymaking opportunities. In 1989, Jeb Bush drew criticism after he traveled to Nigeria on a business trip less than two months after his father, George H.W. Bush, was sworn in as president. "The president's children should not be deprived of career opportunities just because they are members of the first family," the White House press secretary said in 1989. Jeb Bush, through his spokeswoman, declined an interview request. During his interview with the media in Uruguay, Eric was asked about how his life would change under his father's administration. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida has doubled its new-member fees to $200,000 due to growing interest since the election, a major spike that is already drawing criticism that the president is profiting off his rise to the White House.

President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida has doubled its new-member fees to $200,000 due to growing interest since the election, a major spike that is already drawing criticism that the president is profiting off his rise to the White House. The increase, first reported by CNBC... "We're going to have an amazing company, and he's going to do amazing things for the United States," he said to the local media. "He's going to be an incredible commander in chief. And I'm not going to be involved in politics, and he's not going to be involved in the business." He also said that once his father moved to Washington, he would be headed back to New York to run the company with his brother. But there are early signs that Eric and Don Jr. will be spending plenty of time in Washington. Several days ago, the brothers sat side-by-side in the front row during Trump's White House announcement of Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. Afterward, Don Jr. posted on social media that he had enjoyed chatting with Gorsuch about their shared love for fly-fishing. Later this month, Eric and Don Jr. are expected to travel to Vancouver in celebration of the grand opening of the new Trump International Hotel & Tower. The trip is expected to bring the Trump brothers together with wealthy Malaysian developer Tony Tiah Thee Kian and his son, Joo Kim Tiah, head of the Vancouver project. Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush who joined Eisen in the lawsuit, called the family's Secret Service protection a "worthwhile expenditure of taxpayer money." But Painter said he worried that it could be misread as boosting the Trump brand. "All of this has an air of legitimacy: The connection to the U.S. government, and the suggestion that if you do business with this company you'll ingratiate yourself with the Trump administration," Painter said. The implication is "if you do a good deal with us, you'll be in good with the United States. And the Secret Service presence just exacerbates that."

Donald Trump’s bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and three lawsuits over his defunct Trump University are on a collision course. The legal troubles emerged as a common theme in Thursday night’s televised Republican debate, as Trump’s top rivals repeatedly needled him over the allegations of fraud surrounding his real estate school. And as one of the cases nears trial, it appears more likely than ever that Trump, the GOP front-runner, will be called to testify in a courtroom here, quite possibly during the home stretch of the campaign later this year. The San Diego lawsuits A handful of students sued the real estate mogul in 2010, alleging his Trump University was a sham full of misleading promises. The students said in a class-action lawsuit that they had paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trump’s secrets to real estate success. According to the complaint filed in San Diego federal court, they were encouraged to sign up for more expensive levels of instruction, which were to include personal mentoring by experts “handpicked” by Trump. But instead, they say, the seminars were more like infomercials. The lawsuit alleges that the for-profit university’s promises that advanced students could make tens of thousands of dollars each month were bogus, and that the school instead left many in debt. Trump has argued that he can’t be held personally liable because he didn’t run daily operations at the university — although he says he did handpick the instructors. He also disagreed with allegations that the program was worthless. In a television interview, one of Trump’s lawyers said the students failed to reap any benefits because of their own ineptitude, not because of the program. Trump reacted to the lawsuit by countersuing for defamation, but that suit was dismissed. A second, similar class-action lawsuit against Trump was filed in San Diego in 2013 by Art Cohen, a California businessman who attended seminars in Silicon Valley. T.J. Thompson, a real estate agent in Baltimore, said in an interview Friday that she just wants her money back. She said she and her partner got upsold on the Elite $3,500 membership, excited for what it could do for their careers. “I liken it to if I was a 6-foot-6 senior in college and Michael Jordan told me, ‘If you come to my university I can get you in the NBA,’” said Thompson, 58. But, she said, as they attended multiple seminars and continued to get upsold to put down more money, they got little in return. Donald Trump's claim that he can't release his tax records because they're being audited by the Internal Revenue Service doesn't hold up, the agency said Friday. During Thursday night's final GOP debate before Super Tuesday, when numerous states hold their primaries, the real estate developer and... Donald Trump's claim that he can't release his tax records because they're being audited by the Internal Revenue Service doesn't hold up, the agency said Friday. During Thursday night's final GOP debate before Super Tuesday, when numerous states hold their primaries, the real estate developer and... “We’ve been asking for our money back for five years now,” she said. The New York case New York’s state attorney general filed a $40-million lawsuit in 2013 on similar grounds. He says many students expected to meet Trump during seminars but instead got a picture on a life-size cardboard cutout. “While consumers were encouraged to call their credit card companies during breaks to increase their credit limits to have access to funds to do real estate deals, the real reason Trump University asked consumers to request higher credit limits was so they could use the credit to pay for the expensive Elite programs,” the attorney general’s office said. Trump again fired back with a defamation complaint, this time against New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman, but it was dismissed. That lawsuit, and several warnings from the state’s Education Department, prompted the unlicensed online school to drop “University” from its title. Trump renamed it the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, although the school has not operated since 2010. Debate fodder Trump’s legal troubles hit the prime-time spotlight Thursday in what was arguably the most combative of the Republican debates so far. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida more than once referred to Trump’s real estate academy as a fake university, while Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas relished the implications of a presidential candidate being put on the witness stand. “I want you to think about — if this man is the nominee — having the Republican nominee on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud,” Cruz said. “You don’t think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?” And Rubio alleged: “There are people who borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University, and they’re suing now — $36,000 to go to a university that’s a fake school. And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump. That’s what they got for $36,000.” When Trump was able to finally respond without interruption, he appeared confident. “It’s something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don’t want to do it, out of principle,” he said. “The people that took the course all signed — most, many — many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.... “And believe me, I’ll win that case. That’s an easy case.” Thompson, the Maryland real estate agent, said she didn’t catch the debate live but tuned in to online clips the next day. “I wanted to high-five Rubio,” she said. What’s next The case closest to trial is the 2010 San Diego suit. Of the four representative plaintiffs named in the suit, there are two from California and one each from Florida and New York. But now the lead plaintiff, Corona del Mar resident Tarla Makaeff, wants out. In a motion to the judge, Makaeff’s lawyer says her client has endured health problems, family loss and financial troubles since the case began, and she is ready to let the other three class representatives — including Chula Vista resident Sonny Low — carry the case forward. “Subjecting herself to the intense media attention and likely barbs from Trump and his agents and followers simply would not be healthy for her,” the motion argues. Her lawyer goes on to say that although Trump was famous before the lawsuit was filed, no one could have anticipated he’d be the focus of such intense media scrutiny as a political figure. Makaeff’s lawyer said that even after Trump’s defamation suit was dismissed, her client has lived in fear of financial ruin, and that “she still has great trepidation about retaliation.” A hearing on her potential exit is set for March 11. A trial date has not been confirmed for the San Diego suit, but August is being considered — close to the November general election. A pretrial hearing is set for May 6. Last week, each side submitted witness lists for the trial. Trump was on both, with a footnote on the plaintiff’s list that there was an understanding he would be testifying live. If for whatever reason he ends up not getting to court, his deposition testimony could be used instead. kristina.davis@utsandiego.com Twitter: @kristinadavis Davis writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The Senate on Monday confirmed billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary as President Donald Trump adds to his economic team. The vote was 72-27. Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, Ross said the Trump administration will work quickly to re-do the North American Free Trade Agreement. That's the massive trade pact with Canada and Mexico that has boosted trade but still stings laid-off workers across the Midwest. Senators from both political parties were deferential to Ross at his nearly four-hour confirmation hearing, which was much more subdued than the confirmation hearings of other Trump nominees. Former commerce secretaries have praised him, including one who served under former President Barack Obama. "Mr. Ross will bring decades of business, entrepreneurial and civic experience to this important position," said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., chairman of the Commerce Committee. "I believe his extensive management experience in the private sector, and his understanding of the challenges faced by workers and businesses alike, will equip him well for the job of leading the Department of Commerce." Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized Ross' business ties to Russia and the way he ran a mortgage lender during the housing crisis. "Mr. Ross has extensive ties to Russia. He plans to keep making money from his major oil shipping companies while working as Commerce Secretary. He's made billions off the backs of struggling home owners," Warren said Monday. "He is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat." If confirmed by the Senate, the 79-year-old veteran investor will spearhead trade policy and business development in the new administration. If confirmed by the Senate, the 79-year-old veteran investor will spearhead trade policy and business development in the new administration. As part of his ethics agreement, Ross is giving up his position at Diamond S. Shipping, but he will retain a stake in the company, which ships petroleum and other products. As part of the agreement, Ross has promised not to take any action as commerce secretary that would benefit any company in which he has a financial interest. At his confirmation hearing, Ross was not asked about business ties to Russia or his work as a mortgage lender, and he did not address the issues. Senators did note that Ross is divesting from much of his business empire. Worth an estimated $2.9 billion, Ross has extensive business ties around the globe. In 2000, he founded WL Ross & Co., a private equity firm. As part of his ethics agreement, Ross will divest from the firm. So far, the Senate has confirmed 15 out of 22 Trump Cabinet or Cabinet-level picks requiring confirmation. Senators also were expected to move forward on Trump's nomination of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department. If Zinke clears a procedural vote set for late Monday a final vote on confirmation could occur on Tuesday or Wednesday. More than any other officer of his generation, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster's military career has been defined by a willingness to dissent - often forcefully.

More than any other officer of his generation, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster's military career has been defined by a willingness to dissent - often forcefully. In "Dereliction of Duty," the book he wrote in the 1990s, McMaster blasted the nation's top generals for their unwillingness to tell a domineering... During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized U.S. trade deals, including NAFTA. Trump's stance on trade is at odds with many Republicans in Congress, but it endeared him to some voters in the Midwest who believe trade deals cost American jobs. NAFTA was negotiated and signed by President Bill Clinton, with broad support among Republicans in Congress. Ross said all free trade agreements should be systematically re-opened every few years to make sure they are working in the best interests of the U.S. Ross said he is pro-free trade but noted his close relationship with the United Steelworkers union as proof that he will fight to protect American jobs. The union has endorsed him. The commerce secretary has several roles in promoting American business interests in the U.S. and abroad. The department handles trade issues, working to attract foreign investment to the U.S. The department also oversees agencies that manage fisheries, weather forecasting and the Census Bureau, which will conduct a count in 2020. Ross said he has experience at that agency; he was a census-taker while he attended business school.

The idea started with a public Google document. In the weeks after Donald Trump won last year’s presidential election and Republicans kept control of Congress, Sarah Dohl, along with a handful of friends and former Capitol Hill colleagues, wanted Americans — mostly distraught Democrats — to know their voices could still be heard. Not expecting much, they published online a 26-page document in mid-December, outlining a succinct idea: resist. Its title, “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda,” quickly drew interest. George Takei, the actor who starred in the television series “Star Trek,” tweeted it to his 2.2 million followers. So, too, did former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who worked in the Clinton administration. “We just had no idea it would turn into this huge movement,” Dohl, 33, said Saturday from her house in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. “We thought our moms might read it.” What at first started with a small group of young progressives batting around ideas on how to move forward under a Trump administration has blossomed into a national movement, known as Indivisible. The mission centers on grass-roots advocacy targeting members of Congress inclined to work with the new administration and those who, in Indivisible’s view, don’t do enough to oppose it. In keeping with the loose structure of other movements such as Black Lives Matter, Indivisible isn’t a hierarchical organization with a national headquarters and local chapters. Instead, it’s a collection of groups committed to the same goal, employing tactics and operating on principles shared by Indivisible’s founders online. Early on, the focus was attacking Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a freshman from a safe seat in Chicago's suburbs, was just about to deliver his speech against the American Health Care Act when he heard a commotion on the House floor. The bill was being pulled. Democrats, who up until that moment thought the Republicans might... Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a freshman from a safe seat in Chicago's suburbs, was just about to deliver his speech against the American Health Care Act when he heard a commotion on the House floor. The bill was being pulled. Democrats, who up until that moment thought the Republicans might... Members of the movement have caused representatives to flee town halls and, at times, cancel public events altogether. They’ve corralled constituents, visited district offices and made phone calls en masse demanding answers. Not all people who flooded congressional town halls in recent weeks were part of — or had even heard of — Indivisible. But many were. “Every member of Congress cares about how their constituents view them and the narrative being formed in their districts,” said Dohl, who has held several jobs on Capitol Hill, including communications director for Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, whose district includes parts of Austin, Texas. “And we’re not just focused on Republicans. This is about Democrats standing up and having a spine and pushing back against Trump and Republicans.” A chapter within the Indivisible guide is titled “How your member of Congress thinks and how to use that to save Democracy.” It offers up a simple point: “To influence your own Member of Congress (MoC), you have to understand one thing: every House member runs for office every two years and every Senator runs for election every six years. Functionally speaking, MoCs are always either running for office or getting ready for their next election — a fact that shapes everything they do.” The strategy, said Dohl, echoes the tea party movement that sprang up in 2009. At the time, President Obama’s efforts to pass the Affordable Care Act caused a conservative uproar. Images of constituents, angered by the legislation and jabbing fingers in lawmakers’ faces, filled television screens and front pages nationwide. The next election cycle, Democrats, who at the time had controlled both chambers of Congress, lost the House. Now, members of the movement hope it’s the reverse. How does a political activist keep track of the proliferating invitations to march, write postcards, knit pink hats or show up at congressional town hall meetings? Protests have heated up in Chicago since President Donald Trump's inauguration, and so too have online methods for organizing them. How does a political activist keep track of the proliferating invitations to march, write postcards, knit pink hats or show up at congressional town hall meetings? Protests have heated up in Chicago since President Donald Trump's inauguration, and so too have online methods for organizing them. “We’re seeing people who have never been involved in politics now motivated to speak up,” said Ezra Levin, who came up with the idea for the online guide and is now president of Indivisible Guide, which recently registered as nonprofit group. He worked with Dohl on Capitol Hill in 2009, during the rise of the tea party. On Saturday, the two celebrated the GOP collapse on health care. A day earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled a bill that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, because it did not have enough support. Many in the Freedom Caucus, among the most conservative members of Congress, thought the bill did not dismantle Obamacare enough. Democrats and moderate Republicans thought it went too far. Levin, 31, credits Indivisible groups for influencing moderates such as Rep. Barbara Comstock, a Republican who represents a swing district in Virginia. For weeks, Comstock declined requests from constituents — some of whom are associated with Indivisible — for an in-person town hall. Her Capitol Hill and district offices were also flooded with phone calls from constituents seeking more access to her. On Friday, hours before the bill was pulled, Comstock said she would not support it. “This is setting the tone for members of Congress to know that constituents are paying attention,” Levin said. “And they’re not going to stop. This is going forward for months and years.” Laynette Evans, 64, a career coach and resume writer, is among the early organizers of Indivisible Reno. The Reno group has about 1,100 Facebook members and has met a handful of times in recent months to talk about how to get their representatives at all levels of government — Democrats and Republicans alike — to hear them out on issues including health care and immigration. “It’s putting politicians on notice,” said Evans, a Democrat. “With the election of Donald Trump, I think more people are becoming engaged in politics and how our country is being governed.” In January, a day after Trump’s inauguration, millions of people joined women’s marches nationwide. As protests of Trump have ensued, several states have sought to pass legislation that would discourage or criminalize protest. And Trump has described protesters — those at town halls or marching in the streets — as paid professionals who specialize in disrupting Republicans. After the failure to repeal of Obamacare, Trump has indicated he’s ready to move on to other issues, such as tax reform. Whatever the proposal, Trump and Republicans will probably face Indivisible, Levin said. The resistance, Levin said, is not going away. kurtis.lee@latimes.com Twitter: @kurtisalee

Democrats chose former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new national chairman Saturday over a liberal Minnesota congressman, capping a divisive campaign that reflected the depths of the party's electoral failures as well as the energy from resistance to President Donald Trump. Perez, the first Latino to hold the post, edged Rep. Keith Ellison in the second round of voting by Democratic National Committee members gathered in Atlanta. The new chairman must rebuild a party that in the last decade has lost about 1,000 elected posts from the White House to Congress to the 50 statehouses, a power deficit Democrats have not seen nationally in 90 years. In a nod to his winning margin of 35 votes out of 435 cast, to say nothing of the lingering friction between old-guard Democrats and outspoken upstarts, Perez tapped Ellison to serve as deputy chair. "We are all in this together," Perez said, calling on Democrats to fight "the worst president in the history of the United States." Ellison, who had backing from many liberals, including 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, added his own call for unity and noted that he and Perez both want to rebuild state and local Democratic parties across the country. "We don't have the luxury of walking out of this room divided," Ellison said, as the erstwhile rivals stood together on stage as some young Ellison supporters jeered from the gallery. Trump chimed in via Twitter: "Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!" After a string of televised debates, four party-sponsored "future forums" and three months of person-to-person lobbying, the race to lead the Democratic National Committee is coming to an end - with a vote on Saturday that might leave Democrats with new divisions. According to multiple campaigns,... After a string of televised debates, four party-sponsored "future forums" and three months of person-to-person lobbying, the race to lead the Democratic National Committee is coming to an end - with a vote on Saturday that might leave Democrats with new divisions. According to multiple campaigns,... Republicans control the White House, Congress and 33 governorships, while the GOP is one Senate confirmation from a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Despite President Barack Obama's personal electoral successes, the party suffered crushing defeats, losing the House majority in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. Perez told party activists earlier in the day that Democrats face a "crisis of confidence" and "a crisis of relevance." The new chairman first entered the race upon urging from Obama and his inner circle. The former president released a statement praising both men after the vote. "I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity," Obama said, "and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much." The son of Dominican immigrants, Perez comes to the job with a demonstrably liberal record as a civil rights attorney and backer of organized labor, but he carried the establishment label as a Maryland resident who's spent years in the Washington orbit, working in the Justice Department and ultimately as an Obama Cabinet officer. Former House Speaker John Boehner predicted on Thursday that a full repeal and replacement of "Obamacare" is "not going to happen." The Ohio Republican, who was forced out by conservatives in 2015, said he started laughing when he heard President Donald Trump and Republicans promise swift action... Former House Speaker John Boehner predicted on Thursday that a full repeal and replacement of "Obamacare" is "not going to happen." The Ohio Republican, who was forced out by conservatives in 2015, said he started laughing when he heard President Donald Trump and Republicans promise swift action... Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed him; one of Obama's closest aides, Valerie Jarrett, made calls to DNC members on Perez's behalf as late as Friday night. Perez will not be the undisputed "leader of the party," even with Democrats out of power. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California will remain the highest ranking Democrats in Washington. But Perez must now join with Schumer and Pelosi as part cheerleader, part fundraiser, part organizer and recruiter, part public messenger, helping frame the party's arguments and identity, while charting a strategy to turn energy into votes in upcoming elections. Perez and Ellison appeared together for a joint news conference afterward in a session that was originally planned to be the winner's opportunity to address reporters. Perez said they "are going to put our values in action" for a country he described as "fearful" over Trump's priorities. Besides his endorsement from Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Ellison had backing from Schumer, who is not regarded as a hero of party liberals. Liberal groups that backed Ellison ranged from guarded to despondent with the outcome. Sanders released a statement congratulating Perez but warned "it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working." Jim Dean, chair of Democracy for America, called Perez's election "incredibly disappointing" and said the "resistance will persist ... with or without the leadership of the Democratic National Committee." Jeff Weaver, who managed Sanders' presidential campaign and now runs the offshoot "Our Revolution" group, said Perez and Ellison now must prove themselves as a leadership duo. "Do they really invest in 50 state parties? Are they really going to engage with people in the streets?" Weaver asked. "Are they really going to bring those people into the party, so that you have a much broader cross-section of Democratically aligned voters represented?" Ellison told reporters he "trusts" Perez, and he encouraged liberal activists to do the same. Perez succeeds Chairwoman Donna Brazile, who led the party as interim chief in the fallout from disclosure of the DNC hacking. Brazile said the party has worked with cybersecurity experts to address vulnerabilities. She chided Trump for his mockery of DNC cybersecurity and his doubts that Russians are at fault, as U.S. intelligence officials have said. "No, Donald Trump," Brazile said, "you can't go to Staples and buy anti-Russian hacking software."

After President Trump on Friday described the media and what he terms "fake news" as "the enemy of the people," his administration exacted some revenge. The White House press briefing, normally an on-camera affair open to all reporters with press credentials, was turned into an exclusive event for certain outlets hand-picked by the administration. On the list were Trump-friendly outlets such as Breitbart News, the Washington Times and OANN, a conservative television network that employs former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a commentator. Off the list were some of Trump's favorite punching bags including the New York Times and CNN. A correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune was also excluded. The off-camera briefing with Sean Spicer, the press secretary, was not solely for conservative outlets. Several mainstream reporters were also allowed in, as were pool representatives who transmit news events to a far larger group of reporters. The Associated Press and Time magazine were also invited but declined to participate in solidarity with other news organizations that were denied entry. The White House Correspondents' Association protested, as did editors at several of the organizations that were excluded. In a statement, Times editor Davan Maharaj said that it was "unfortunate that the Los Angeles Times has been excluded from a White House press briefing today." "The public has a right to know, and that means being informed by a variety of news sources, not just those filtered by the White House press office in hopes of getting friendly coverage," Maharaj said. "Regardless of access, The Times will continue to report on the Trump administration without fear or favor," he added.

President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Wednesday directing his interior secretary to review the designation of tens of millions of acres of land as "national monuments," an action that could upend protections put in place in Utah and other states as Trump tries to rack up accomplishments in his first 100 days. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the president to declare federal lands as monuments and restrict how the lands can be used. "The executive order will direct me as the secretary to review prior monument designations and to suggest legislative changes or modifications to the monuments," Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters at the White House Tuesday evening. While Zinke acknowledged criticism that the act has been over-used by past presidents, he insisted he'd approach the topic with an open mind. "I'm not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be," he said. Former President Barack Obama infuriated Utah Republicans when he created the Bears Ears National Monument in late December on more than 1 million acres of land that's sacred to Native Americans and home to tens of thousands of archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings. Republicans in the state said it was an egregious abuse of executive power and have asked Trump to take the unusual step of reversing the designation, arguing it will stymie growth by closing the area to new commercial and energy development. The Antiquities Act does not give the president explicit power to undo a designation and no president has ever taken such a step. The order is one of a handful the president is set to sign this week as he tries to rack up accomplishments ahead of his 100th day in office. The president has used executive orders aggressively over the last three months, despite railing against their use by Obama when he was campaigning. Zinke said the order, which Trump will sign during a visit to his department, will cover several dozen monuments across the country designated since 1996 that total 100,000 acres or more, from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah to the Bears Ears in southeastern Utah. He'll provide an interim report in 45 days in which he'll provide a recommendation on Bears Ears and a final report within 120 days. Over the last 20 years, Zinke said, tens of millions of acres have been designated as national monuments, limiting their use for farming, timber harvesting, mining and oil and gas exploration, and other commercial uses. Though "by and large," Zinke said, he feels the designations have done "a great service to the public," he said he worries about overuse and overreach. "I think the concern that I have and the president has is that when you designate a monument, the local community affected should have a voice," he said. Some, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have hailed the order as the end of "massive federal land grabs" by presidents dating to Bill Clinton. But Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said that if Trump truly wants to make America great again, he should use the Antiquities Act to protect and conserve America's public lands. In New Mexico, Obama's designation of Rio Grande del Norte National Monument and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument have preserved important lands while boosting the economy, Heinrich said, a story that has been repeated across the country. "If this sweeping review is an excuse to cut out the public and scale back protections, I think this president is going to find a very resistant public,'" Heinrich said. Recent polls have shown strong support for national parks and monuments, said Christy Goldfuss, who directed the White House Council on Environmental Quality under Obama. Kristina Waggoner, vice president of the Boulder-Escalante Chamber of Commerce in Utah, said business near the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument in southern Utah are booming, driven by sharp increases in tourism since the area was designated in 1996 by President Bill Clinton. "I'm here today to support the monument and my 3-year-old son," Waggoner said on a conference call with reporters organized by a pro-Obama group. "Once our land is gone, it's gone forever."

President Donald Trump on Thursday made a messy case that he "inherited a mess" from his predecessor. Economic stats and territorial losses of Islamic State insurgents don't support his assertions about the problems handed to him on those fronts. A look at some of his claims in a news conference Thursday and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: "To be honest I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess." THE FACTS: A mess is in the eye of the beholder. But by almost every economic measure, President Barack Obama inherited a far worse situation when he became president in 2009 than he left for Trump. He had to deal with the worst downturn since the Depression. Unemployment was spiking, the stock market crashing, the auto industry failing and millions of Americans risked losing their homes to foreclosure when Obama took the oath of office. None of those statistics is as dire for Trump. Unemployment is 4.8 percent, compared with a peak of 10 percent during Obama's first year as president. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was cratering until March 2009, only to rebound roughly 200 percent over the rest of Obama's term— gains that have continued under Trump on the promise of tax and regulatory cuts. President Trump appeared Thursday at a news conference to announce his replacement choice for Labor secretary. Trump went on to address a wide-range of topics, including Russia, his plans for a new executive order on a travel ban, “fake news,” leaks, his electoral victory, his wife, Melania, and... President Trump appeared Thursday at a news conference to announce his replacement choice for Labor secretary. Trump went on to address a wide-range of topics, including Russia, his plans for a new executive order on a travel ban, “fake news,” leaks, his electoral victory, his wife, Melania, and... When Trump assumed office last month, a greater percentage of the country had health insurance, incomes were rising and the country was adding jobs. The Trump administration has noted that a smaller proportion of the population is working or looking for jobs. But even this measure began to turn around toward the end of the Obama era. Yet it's true that jobs at factories and coal mines have been disappearing for more than three decades, while many Americans with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes fall after adjusting for inflation. The home ownership rate has slipped even as the economy has improved, leaving many pockets of the country feeling left out of a recovery that technically began more than seven years ago. TRUMP: "ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited." THE FACTS: The Islamic State group began to lose ground before Trump took office, not just in Iraq and Syria but also in Libya. The gradual military progress achieved in Iraq during Obama's final two years has pushed IS to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main Iraqi stronghold. It remains a potent danger beyond its shrunken territory, encouraging adherents to stage acts of terrorism. The analogy with cancer is an echo of Obama's last defense secretary, Ash Carter, who repeatedly cast Obama's counter-IS campaign as an effort to reverse the extremists' "metastasis" beyond the "parent tumor" in Iraq and Syria. TRUMP: "I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved. THE FACTS:  Did he just say a "fine-tuned machine"? Trump's first month has been consumed by a series of missteps and firestorms, and produced far less significant legislation than Obama enacted during his first month. Aggrieved and spoiling for a fight, Donald Trump used a marathon encounter with reporters Thursday to denounce the "criminal" leaks that took down his top national security adviser and revived questions about his own ties to Russia. But he offered only a lawyerly denial that his campaign aides... Aggrieved and spoiling for a fight, Donald Trump used a marathon encounter with reporters Thursday to denounce the "criminal" leaks that took down his top national security adviser and revived questions about his own ties to Russia. But he offered only a lawyerly denial that his campaign aides... Republican-led congressional committees will investigate the Trump team's relations with Russians before he took office and the flood of leaks that altogether forced out his national security adviser in record time. His pick for labor secretary withdrew because he didn't have enough Republican support. By many measures, the administration is in near paralysis in its earliest days, leaving allies unsettled and many in Congress anxious about what Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., called the "constant disruption." To many Republicans — never mind Democrats — the "fine-tuned machine" seems in danger of its wheels coming off. In his first month, Obama signed a $787 billion stimulus package into law, as well as a law expanding health care for children and the Lilly Ledbetter bill on equal pay for women. Trump has vigorously produced executive orders, which don't require congressional approval and typically have narrow effect. The one with far-reaching consequences — banning entry by refugees and by visitors from seven countries — has been blocked by courts. Trump's biggest initiatives, such as tax cuts and a replacement for Obama's health care law, have not emerged. On Thursday he was signing into law a rollback of Obama-era regulations on mining near streams. Congress has sent him little else. TRUMP, bragging again about his Electoral College vote total: "We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before, so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan." THE FACTS: Not even close. In the seven previous elections, the winner of five of those contests won a larger Electoral College majority than Trump. They were George H.W. Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996; and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. When a reporter pointed out that Trump was overstating his winning margin, the president said:  "Well, I don't know, I was given that information." He then called it "a very substantial victory." Asked for the first time publicly to address the dismissal of Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, President Donald Trump was clear Wednesday in his frustration. But the president’s target was not Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, nor his conduct. “Gen. Flynn is a wonderful man,”... Asked for the first time publicly to address the dismissal of Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, President Donald Trump was clear Wednesday in his frustration. But the president’s target was not Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, nor his conduct. “Gen. Flynn is a wonderful man,”... Trump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes because of the defection of two electors in December, but he had won enough states in November to get to 306. TRUMP, saying the appeals court that blocked his selective travel ban "has been overturned at a record number." THE FACTS: Other appeals courts have seen their decisions overturned at a higher rate than the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit that froze his action on immigration. In the most recent full term, the Supreme Court reversed 8 of the 11 cases from the 9th Circuit. But the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit went 0 for 3 — that is, the Supreme Court reversed all three cases it heard from that circuit. And over the past five years, five federal appeals courts were reversed at a higher rate than the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest of the 13 federal courts of appeals. In raw numbers, more cases are heard and reversed from the 9th Circuit year in and year out. But as a percentage of cases the Supreme Court hears, the liberal-leaning circuit fares somewhat better, according to statistical compilations by Scotusblog. Most cases decided by appeals courts aren't appealed to the Supreme Court, and the high court only accepts a small percentage of those for review. But the very act of the Supreme Court's agreeing to hear a case means the odds are it will be overturned; the court reverses about two-thirds of the cases it hears.

In a recorded midnight apology, Donald Trump declared, "I was wrong and I apologize," after being caught in a recording making shockingly vulgar and sexually charged comments. Yet he also defiantly dismissed the revelations as "nothing more than a distraction" from a decade ago and signaled he would close his presidential campaign by arguing rival Hillary Clinton has committed greater sins against women. "I've said some foolish things," Trump said in a video posted on his Facebook page early Saturday. "But there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims." Despite calls by numerous Republicans for him to resign, Trump was defiant Saturday, telling the Washington Post “I’d never withdraw. I’ve never withdrawn in my life." Trump added, "I have tremendous support.” Trump's 90-second apology video capped a jarring day that threatened to sink the billionaire businessman's White House campaign, sending Republicans into a panic with just over a month until Election Day and on the cusp of Sunday's crucial presidential debate. One by one Friday, outraged GOP lawmakers condemned Trump's comments in a 2005 video obtained and released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC News. In the video, Trump is heard describing attempts to have sex with a married woman. He also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. "When you're a star they let you do it," Trump says. "You can do anything." He adds seconds later, "Grab them by the p----. You can do anything." Trump was slapped by his own running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who said he was "offended by the words and actions" Trump described in the video. "I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them," the Republican vice presidential nominee said. Having canceled a scheduled appearance in Wisconsin on Saturday afternoon, Pence cited Sunday night's presidential debate as an opportunity for Trump to "show what is in his heart." Several of the Republicans who want Trump out say Pence should take his place as the nominee. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was "sickened" by Trump's comments, while a brief response from GOP's chairman was surprisingly terse. "No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever," said Reince Priebus, who had stood by Trump through his past provocative comments. Ryan added tartly that Trump was "no longer attending" a joint campaign appearance set for Saturday in Wisconsin. Trump himself later said in a statement that he would be preparing for Sunday night's debate instead. Other Republicans, painfully aware of Trump's possible impact on their own political fates, were quick to chime in. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a big Trump supporter, called Trump's words "inexcusable." But for some Republican officials, Trump had finally gone too far. By the time Trump posted his video apology, several Republican members of Congress had called on Trump to abandon the race. Among them was Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who called Trump's words "some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine." New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is locked in a close race, called his comments "totally inappropriate and offensive" and said she is dropping her support for Trump and will instead write in vice presidential running mate Mike Pence's name for president. "As disappointed as I've been with his antics throughout this campaign, I thought supporting the nominee was the best thing for our country and our party," Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement. "Now, it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country and our party is for Trump to step aside and allow a responsible, respectable Republican to lead the ticket." Utah Sen. Mike Lee called on Trump to drop out of the race, posting a live video on his Facebook page early Saturday: "You, sir, are the distraction. Your conduct, sir, is the distraction." Lee added that the goal of the GOP is to defeat the Democratic nominee and for that reason, he says, Trump should step aside. The current governor of Utah rescinded his endorsement Friday and former Utah governor, Chinese ambassador and 2012 presidential candidate Jon Huntsman called on Trump to resign and let Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, take the top of the Republican ticket. Nevada Senate candidate Joe Heck said he was withdrawing his support: "I can no longer look past this pattern of behavior and inappropriate comments from Donald Trump." And South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership team, offered a sharp rebuke as well: "Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately." Recordings just part of a bad Friday For more than a year, Trump's outrageous and often outlandish comments have given Republicans fits. But with some notable exceptions — including nearly all the party's living past presidents and White House nominees — GOP officials have at least nominally thrown their support behind him. Some of that support has been driven by a belief that Trump needs to at least be competitive in the November election in order to give candidates in down-ballot races a chance to win. The question many Republicans now face is whether the balance will now tip and supporting Trump becomes the riskier position. Even before the recording's revelation on Friday, Trump was struggling to steady his campaign. Earlier that same day, he claimed without evidence that the U.S. Border Patrol had been ordered to allow immigrants to illegally cross the border to vote in the upcoming election during a round table discussion with the Border Patrol officers' union. "They are letting people pour into the country so they can go ahead and vote," Trump said. A union spokesperson was forced to clarify that both Trump and a union leader seated next to him at the time had mischaracterized the situation during comments in front of reporters. Trump also said that "the Central Park Five" -- five black teenage boys convicted in the brutal rape of a 28-year-old white woman jogging through Central Park -- were actually guilty of the crime for which they were exonerated. In 2002, another man confessed to the crime and DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene. The five who were convicted received a $41 million settlement from New York state in 2014. "They admitted they were guilty," Trump said in a statement to CNN that was published Friday. "The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous." All this after he had an uneven performance in the first debate and in the following days, bewilderingly feuded with a beauty queen he had shamed for gaining weight. That incident stunned Republicans, particularly given Trump's desperate need to shore up support among women. But the businessman's comments about the Miss Universe contestant pale in comparison to his words in the newly released recording. On it, Trump is caught on a live microphone while talking with Billy Bush of "Access Hollywood." The candidate is heard saying "I did try and f--- her. She was married." He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman's body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women. "Access Hollywood" said an Associated Press story about Trump's lewd behind-the-scenes comments as star of "The Apprentice" led it to dig through its archives and turn up the previously unaired footage from 2005. It was recorded during a bus ride while Trump was on his way to tape an episode of the soap opera "Days of Our Lives." Trump issued a short apology Friday afternoon, saying he was sorry "if anyone was offended." As he did hours later, he shifted attention toward the Clintons, saying the former president "has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close." Trump has spent months hinting he might make the Clintons' marital issues and their handling of the president's affairs a campaign issue. Earlier this week, he said he didn't plan to raise the matters in Sunday's town hall-style debate, but his early morning video suggests he may have changed his mind. The Republican desperately needs a standout performance in the debate. With his invitation to Wisconsin rescinded, he said he would spend Saturday in New York preparing for the faceoff with Clinton. Pence, Trump's running mate, planned to replace him at the Wisconsin event. Coming off a widely praised performance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Pence ignored questions shouted by reporters in Rossford, Ohio, where he was campaigning Friday with his daughter. Clinton dodges bullet? As Friday became consumed by Trump's vulgarity, Republicans bemoaned another lost opportunity to chip away at Clinton. The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta, including some with excerpts from speeches she gave to Wall Street executives and others — speeches she has declined to release despite demands from Trump. The excerpts include Clinton seeming to put herself in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated from. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her dream was "a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders." But a distracted Trump didn't seem to notice, focusing instead on pushing attention toward Bill Clinton's infidelities even as he apologized for his intemperate remarks. "We will discuss this more in the coming days," he said at the end of his midnight video. "See you at the debate on Sunday." Associated Press

Donald Trump's campaign has begun formally vetting possible running mates, with former House speaker Newt Gingrich emerging as the leading candidate, followed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But there are more than a half-dozen others being discussed as possibilities, according to several people with knowledge of the process. Given Trump's unpredictability, campaign associates caution that the presumptive Republican nominee could still shake up his shortlist. But with little more than two weeks before the start of the Republican National Convention, Gingrich and Christie have been asked to submit documents and are being cast as favorites for the post inside the campaign. Gingrich in particular is the beneficiary of a drumbeat of support from Trump confidants such as Ben Carson. A number of senators - including Jeff Sessions (Alabama) and Bob Corker (Tennessee) - are also being reviewed as viable picks, although the extent to which they are being vetted is unclear. A longer shot on Trump's radar is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a heavyweight on the right who could bolster Trump's tepid support among some conservative activists. But Pence is immersed in his reelection race and Trump is said to want a more electric politician at his side rather than a low-profile figure. Most of his primary rivals are reluctant to sign on, and tensions with Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, remain raw. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, stands with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at a campaign event Thursday, May 19, 2016, in Lawrenceville, N.J. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, stands with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at a campaign event Thursday, May 19, 2016, in Lawrenceville, N.J. Details of the running-mate search were provided by five people with knowledge of the process who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with campaign officials. Gingrich, who said on "Fox News Sunday" over the weekend that "nobody has called me" from the Trump campaign about the possibility of being vice president, declined to comment. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also declined to comment. Christie's office did not respond to an inquiry. The contenders under the most serious consideration, such as Gingrich and Christie, have been asked by attorney Arthur Culvahouse Jr. to answer more than 100 questions and to provide reams of personal and professional files that include tax records and any articles or books they have published. Culvahouse, a former White House counsel who is managing the vetting for Trump, was the lawyer who vetted then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for the GOP vice-presidential nomination during the 2008 campaign. The narrowing list of running-mate possibilities comes at the end of a turbulent period for Trump, who has struggled to raise money since clinching the GOP nomination and has stumbled through a series of self-inflicted controversies, including a racially charged attack on a sitting federal judge and a continuing outcry over his rhetoric against Muslims and other minorities. The presumptive Republican nominee continues to indicate that he will probably choose someone who could balance his brash populist persona with a political profile that includes deep experience in Washington or ties to the party establishment, the people familiar with the search said. The timing of Trump's announcement was for months expected to happen close to the convention. But campaign aides are now discussing moving it up, perhaps to later next week so the ticket can generate headlines and coverage - and win over party leaders - ahead of the party gathering in Cleveland. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday he has not had any conversations with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about serving as his running mate and suggested it would be premature to rule it in or out because the spot hasn't been offered. "You should never turn... Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday he has not had any conversations with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about serving as his running mate and suggested it would be premature to rule it in or out because the spot hasn't been offered. "You should never turn... With Gingrich, 73, or Christie, 53, the 70-year-old mogul would be joined by a well-connected Republican who shares his combative style and his ease at being an ubiquitous media presence. Both men have won Trump's favor by actively supporting him - Gingrich primarily through television appearances and Christie through behind-the-scenes talks with party leaders and leading GOP donors. Their experience facing down and cutting deals with Democrats has also drawn the interest of Trump, who has acknowledged that he would be a novice at working directly with lawmakers. Sessions and Corker are among the other names mentioned by people who have spoken with Trump officials. Sessions, a conservative populist who was the first senator to endorse Trump last year, has seen many of his trusted aides take on high-ranking roles in the Trump campaign. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has voiced support for some of Trump's views. Sens. Richard Burr (North Carolina), Tom Cotton (Arkansas) and John Thune (South Dakota) have also been bandied about in Trump Tower as options. Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, who previously served in the House, are two of the leading women in the mix. But shortcomings for many of these candidates have made their chances seem less likely to Trump advisers. Pence, Thune and Burr would bring heft and have held leadership positions, but they are focused on their reelection bids. Corker is well liked by campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but his recent public criticisms of Trump's tone and statements have not been welcomed by the candidate. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump met with Bob Corker in New York on Monday, intensifying speculation that the U.S. senator from Tennessee may be on Trump's vice presidential shortlist. Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Corker described the get-together at Trump... Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump met with Bob Corker in New York on Monday, intensifying speculation that the U.S. senator from Tennessee may be on Trump's vice presidential shortlist. Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Corker described the get-together at Trump... Cruz is seen as someone Trump would like to bring into the fold because of his political capital with the conservative movement. But their bitter clashes during the primary have left a mark, and Cruz has so far declined to endorse Trump. That has not stopped members of Trump's team from reaching out to members of Cruz's circle and trying for a reconciliation. Trump's desire for a governing partner is not the only factor that has been mentioned in discussions among aides. Contenders' rapport with the mogul and their ability to comfortably communicate and defend his nontraditional platform are also crucial, the people familiar with the process said. Less central have been the candidates' home states or regional influence, given that Trump sees the campaign as a nationalized political war that is largely being fought on television. Trump's inclination toward naming a seasoned figure has been encouraged by Manafort, the longtime GOP insider who has taken full control of the process following Trump's firing of Corey Lewandowski, who had been campaign manager. Yet even as Manafort steers the selection and as members of Trump's orbit - especially his children and son-in-law Jared Kushner - informally weigh in, there is a collective understanding within the campaign that Trump's voice is the only voice that matters. One person involved in the process suggested the ultimate decision will come down to a committee of one: Trump. "This is in his head," the person said. "It's up to him." Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor who has become close with Trump during the campaign, said in an interview that while he has not spoken to Trump about the vice-presidential slot, Trump has made clear that he "wants someone who can help get his legislative agenda through Congress." "I think that is how he is going," Jeffress said. "He'd be coming in as an outsider, and that has fueled his popularity. But he is the first to admit that he doesn't know all the ways of Washington. So to actually push what he wants through, he's willing to reach out and get somebody to lend a hand."

President Donald Trump and White House officials pressed congressional Republicans on Sunday to use the looming threat of a government shutdown to win funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top priority for the administration as it nears the symbolic 100-day mark. Trump wants funding to be included in a spending measure that would keep the government open past April 28, a determined effort that has prompted a possible standoff with lawmakers in both parties, who hope to avert a federal closure next weekend. Trump's push for fast action on his pledge to build the border wall is part of a mounting and, at times, tense scramble inside the administration to kick-start the president's agenda, even if it risks dire political consequences. It follows weeks of frustration within the White House over inaction and stalemates on Capitol Hill over big-ticket items such as health care and tax cuts. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post that the president and his advisers remain "strong" in their commitment to securing funding for border security and a wall. "This is what the president ran on," Priebus said. "We want to get to a place this week where border-security money is being directed to the Department of Homeland Security so that we can begin surveillance and preliminary work, and then we will keep working on getting DHS what it needs for the structure." The timing promises a week of high drama on the Hill. The Senate returns Monday night, and the House returns Tuesday from a two-week recess, leaving just three days when both chambers will be in session to wrangle out a funding agreement. Negotiators worked throughout the break, but thus far a deal has not been struck. The wall, which experts say would cost $21.6 billion and take three and a half years to construct, has emerged as a crucial sticking point for the White House, with the president insisting privately and publicly that progress toward its funding and eventual construction must be showcased this week. "Congress is right to be nervous, but that's Trump's style to be aggressive, ambitious, right out of 'The Art of the Deal,'" said William Bennett, a conservative commentator and close friend of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. "Everyone seems to be getting used to that and how Trump doesn't want the half loaf but the whole loaf." In a tweet Sunday, Trump elbowed Democrats who have resisted his call to include wall funding. He chastised them for not wanting "money from the budget going to the border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs" and gang activity, in his view. Trump added that he would continue to ask Mexico to pay for the project, another bold proclamation he made during the campaign. Meanwhile, he said, he will press Congress for funding "so we can get started early" on the "badly needed border wall." It remained unclear Sunday whether moderates within the GOP could convince the White House to avoid a shutdown. Democrats have insisted that they will not vote for any spending bill that gives the White House money or flexibility to begin construction of a border barrier. They believe that the GOP will have to either abandon Trump's demand or assume political responsibility if a shutdown occurs. "The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Building a wall is not an answer. Not here or any place." Inside the White House on Sunday, West Wing aides made calls to congressional allies, while the president tweeted and reached out to several advisers, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump's tweets included a shot at Democrats in which he drew parallels between border-wall funding and continued federal payments for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Some Trump associates said that they believe Democrats may be willing to deal on border funding if those payments are put on the table this week during cross-party talks. "ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going — otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought," Trump tweeted. He later followed: "The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members." The tweets did little to assuage concerns created earlier in the day when White House budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested that Trump might not sign a spending bill that does not meet his demands. "Will he sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall?" Chris Wallace, host of "Fox News Sunday," asked Mulvaney during a televised interview. "We don't know yet," Mulvaney responded. Mulvaney said the White House expects Democrats to cave on the border wall in exchange for guaranteed payments under the ACA. But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., have already rejected a White House offer to build into the spending bill a dollar-for-dollar match in wall funding and federal health-care payments. Negotiators want the stopgap measure to keep government open by keeping spending flat, including money to keep the ACA going. Trump is hoping to open that up for negotiation in exchange for wall money. Democrats believe that voters will blame Trump for a shutdown, particularly if congressional leaders omit wall funding from a spending deal. Democrats and GOP leaders appeared to be nearing a spending agreement last week before Trump ramped up his demands. Aides hailed the budget talks as one of the only active discussions in which Democrats and Republicans maintained common ground. One clear area of agreement was not to include border funding in the stopgap budget. Democrats agreed to include other border-security measures, including money for new drones to patrol the border, but it was agreed that the wall itself should be debated separately, after the government is kept open. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among a group of prominent Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they hope to avoid a border wall fight this week. "I think that's a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018," Rubio said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "If we can do some of that now, that would be great. But we cannot shut down the government right now. Mulvaney's hard-line stance is also odds with a White House faction convinced that a government shutdown would be cataclysmic for an administration already struggling to prove its ability to govern, according to GOP aides in the White House and Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks. Republican leaders have signaled that they will concentrate this week on keeping the government open, even if that means ignoring White House calls for action on other major priorities, such as rewriting the tax code and overhauling the ACA. Trump has pushed his staff in recent days to prod House Republicans for final revisions in a health-care proposal that can win support from both the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group. And that task led advisers over the weekend to rely especially on three key players — Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Tuesday Group; Rep. Mark Meadows R-N.C., chairman of the Freedom Caucus; and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House GOP chief deputy whip - to finalize legislation. But the White House's efforts to work directly with various House coalitions and piece together a compromise health-care package has led to private unease on Capitol Hill, where some GOP members close to the leadership have grumbled that Trump aides are setting up the party for defeat or a stumble should the tweaked health bill not have as strong support as the White House has suggested. Trump's advisers, aware of those concerns, still plowed forward Sunday on crafting the bill's language, citing the president's desire for action. There were ongoing conversations about the timing for a health vote, with Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or even sometime in early May, if necessary, discussed as options. Ryan addressed that pressure in a conference call Saturday afternoon, in which he told GOP members that while he hoped that they would continue health-care talks, his top priority will be the stopgap spending bill. "Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support." Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call. The Washington Post's Abby Phillip and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton holds a commanding lead in her native state over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of next Tuesday's Illinois primary election, a new Chicago Tribune poll has found. The survey showed Clinton outpacing Sanders by a better than 2-to-1 margin, with 67 percent saying they'd vote for the former secretary of state and 25 percent saying they'd back the Vermont senator. Another 8 percent were undecided. Clinton swept nearly every demographic and geographic category among Illinois Democratic voters. And nearly 4 of 5 voters had a favorable opinion of Clinton, who was born in Chicago and grew up in suburban Park Ridge, compared to about 6 in 10 with a favorable view of Sanders. Themes that have emerged nationally throughout Clinton's and Sanders' duel for the nomination were evident in the Illinois poll. Clinton, who's also a former first lady and U.S. senator, continued to perform best among women and minority voters while Sanders, who has pitched a message of economic revolution, received his strongest support from younger and more liberal voters. Even if Sanders doesn't end up with much of Illinois' popular vote next week, he can still win some nominating delegates to the national convention because, like the other Democratic primaries and caucuses, it's not a winner-take-all contest. There are 182 delegates at stake in Illinois. Of that total, 102 will be awarded proportionately based on the vote for president in each of the state's 18 congressional districts, as long as a candidate gets at least 15 percent in a particular district. Republican Donald Trump leads his three rivals in Illinois' presidential primary, according to a new Chicago Tribune poll that shows many of the fissures affecting the GOP nationally have come to the Midwest.

Republican Donald Trump leads his three rivals in Illinois' presidential primary, according to a new Chicago Tribune poll that shows many of the fissures affecting the GOP nationally have come to the Midwest. The survey, conducted Wednesday through Sunday, also found Trump holds his advantage despite... Nationally, Clinton so far has collected 1,130 delegates to 499 for Sanders, with 2,383 delegates needed to wrap up the nomination at this summer's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clinton's lead has been bolstered by the support of hundreds of so-called superdelegates — party leaders and elected officials who are free to support whomever they choose regardless of a state's election results. The proportional delegate format places emphasis on having a statewide organization win in each congressional district, and the Tribune poll showed Clinton with a sizable lead in all regions. In Chicago and Cook County, Clinton led Sanders 71 percent to 20 percent. In the suburban collar counties, Clinton led 73 percent to 23 percent. And in the 96 Downstate counties, Clinton had 60 percent to 31 percent over Sanders. So far during the campaign, Clinton has earned her biggest victories in states with a high percentage of minority voters, such as South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia. The Tribune poll showed that trend could continue in Illinois, where a large base of minority voters live in and near Chicago. As Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debated about the auto bailout, Sanders interrupted Clinton, saying, "Excuse me, I'm talking." March 6, 2016. (AP) As Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debated about the auto bailout, Sanders interrupted Clinton, saying, "Excuse me, I'm talking." March 6, 2016. (AP) The survey found Clinton's strongest support came from African-Americans, with 76 percent of black voters saying they'd vote for her compared with 16 percent for Sanders. An overwhelming 85 percent of black voters had a favorable impression of Clinton while just 4 percent had an unfavorable view. By contrast, only 44 percent of black voters said they had a favorable view of Sanders while 18 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion. Among Hispanics, Clinton led Sanders 74 percent to 19 percent. Similar to the numbers with black voters, nearly 75 percent of Hispanic voters had a favorable impression of Clinton while just 48 percent said the same about Sanders. Clinton also led 70 percent to 22 percent among moderate voters. Sanders fared better among voters who identified themselves as liberal, but Clinton still led in that group 59 percent to 35 percent. The one bright spot in the poll for Sanders: Like other states, he held the upper hand with the youngest voters in Illinois. Among Democratic voters ages 18 to 35, Sanders had 56 percent to 44 percent for Clinton. But voters ages 36 to 49 broke for Clinton, 51 percent to 43 percent. She also dominated among voters older than 50, with nearly 70 percent of voters favoring Clinton. The poll also showed Clinton's and Sanders' backers have a different set of priorities that mirror their chosen candidates. Asked to choose their most important quality in a presidential contender, 37 percent of Sanders' voters listed "strong moral character," while "a true progressive" came in second with 26 percent. Among Clinton voters, 57 percent said having the necessary experience was the most important attribute followed by 16 percent who said the ability to win in November was the top quality needed in a candidate. Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for president. Clinton's and Sanders' supporters did agree on the top two issues they believed were most important in the presidential race: the economy, followed by gun control. Overall, 45 percent of Democratic voters said the economy was most important, followed by 17 percent who said gun control, 13 percent who said national security, 12 percent who said the Affordable Care Act and 6 percent who answered criminal justice reform. Voters' income had little impact on who they'd vote for in the primary — Clinton received about 70 percent support across income levels. The Research America Inc. poll was conducted from March 2-6, featuring landline and cellphone interviews of 600 registered Illinois voters who said they are likely to vote or have already cast a ballot in the Democratic primary. It has an error margin of 4.1 percentage points. bruthhart@tribpub.com Twitter @BillRuthhart

President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday he will nominate lawyer Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative, picking an experienced trade official who has questioned the conservative movement's commitment to free trade. Lighthizer, who served as deputy USTR under President Ronald Reagan, would play a key role in Trump's trade agenda. The president-elect has vigorously opposed the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, but has said he would ink one-on-one trade deals with individual countries. Trump has also signaled a tough stance on trade with China, including levying a hefty tariff on Chinese imports. "Ambassador Lighthizer is going to do an outstanding job representing the United States as we fight for good trade deals that put the American worker first," Trump said Tuesday in a statement announcing his pick. "He has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity." Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. Lighthizer, who played a senior role during Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, has more recently worked on trade issues as a lawyer, representing manufacturing, agricultural and high-tech companies, according to his law firm biography. Lighthizer's bio also states that he focused on "market-opening trade actions on behalf of U.S. companies seeking access to foreign markets." Yet in 2008, he openly questioned GOP presidential nominee John McCain's commitment to free trade in a New York Times opinion article. "Mr. McCain may be a conservative. But his unbridled free-trade policies don't help make that case," Lighthizer wrote at the time, suggesting that free trade had long been popular among liberals. "Moreover, many American conservatives have opposed free trade. Jesse Helms, the most outspoken conservative in the Senate for three decades, was no free trader. Neither was Alexander Hamilton, who could be considered the founder of American conservatism," he wrote. Sonny Perdue III, the former governor of Georgia, is president-elect Donald Trump's leading candidate to be his U.S. secretary of agriculture, according to a person familiar with the matter. Perdue, 70, would succeed Tom Vilsack. Perdue met with Trump Nov. 30 and afterward said they talked about...

Meanwhile, Trump returned to his New York headquarters Monday after spending the holidays at his private club in South Florida. With less than three weeks until his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump is expected to fill out a handful of remaining Cabinet-level posts in the coming days. In addition to the USTR, Trump is also weighing picks to lead the departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, as well as a director of national intelligence. In addition, Trump is still filling out some top White House positions. Trump has already signaled that he plans to spread work on his trade policies beyond USTR. His transition team has said billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Trump's nominee to head the Commerce Department, will play a lead role on trade. The president-elect has also named economist Peter Navarro to a newly created White House National Trade Council. Trump indicated Tuesday that Lighthizer would work "in close coordination" with Ross and Navarro. Lighthizer declared his allegiance to Trump's approach on trade. "I am fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans," he said. Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether critical computer networks can ever be protected from intruders, alarming cybersecurity experts who say his comments could upend more than a decade of national cybersecurity policy and put both government and private data at risk. Asked late Saturday about Russian hacking allegations and his cybersecurity plans, Trump told reporters that "no computer is safe" and that, for intelligence officials, "hacking is a very hard thing to prove." "You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier," he said as he entered a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. "I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly," Trump said earlier last week. He tweets prolifically but says he rarely uses any other communications technology more advanced than the telephone. "The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the kind of security that you need." Since President George W. Bush moved to develop a comprehensive national cybersecurity policy after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has made a top priority of preserving the integrity of the public- and private-sector computer networks that enable modern commerce and society. Trump delivered a campaign address in October that deemed cybersecurity "a major priority for both the government and the private sector" and said that cyberattacks from both state and non-state actors "constitute one of our most critical national security concerns." President-elect Donald Trump says that "no computer is safe" when it comes to keeping information private, expressing new skepticism about the security of online communications his administration is likely to use for everything from day-to-day planning to international relations.

President-elect Donald Trump says that "no computer is safe" when it comes to keeping information private, expressing new skepticism about the security of online communications his administration is likely to use for everything from day-to-day planning to international relations. Trump rarely uses... But the U.S. intelligence community's determination that Russia engaged in a state-sponsored hacking effort aimed at electing Trump has prompted the president-elect to openly question the reliability of that assessment while simultaneously taking aim at the broader notion of cybersecurity. Experts said Sunday that Trump's comments and his handling of the Russian hacking allegations could embolden foreign hackers and undermine the U.S. government's ability to respond to them. Michael Sulmeyer, a former Defense Department policy adviser who directs the cybersecurity project for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, referred to one of Trump's earliest efforts - during a presidential debate in September - to cast doubt on allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. "This is not some issue about a 400-pound hacker in a bedroom who might be mischievous," Sulmeyer said. "These are real threats to our country, and the concerning part for me is to see how this issue has become politicized and made partisan." A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by President Barack Obama's administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials. While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials... A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by President Barack Obama's administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials. While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials... Although some Republicans have pushed for a sharper response to the Russian hacking - notably Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) - many others have joined Trump in playing down the intense coverage and debate. "Russia spying on the U.S. is not news," said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a top Trump ally. "It's what they do. A lot is being made about something that's already known. To all the people acting shocked, it's as if they're shocked there is gambling going on in a casino." Transition spokesman Sean Spicer, slated to become White House communications director upon Trump's inauguration, said Sunday that intelligence officials will brief Trump this week on the election-related hacking. He suggested on ABC's "This Week" that the retaliatory sanctions President Barack Obama imposed against Russia last week - which included the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence agents - may not have been justified. "The question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?" Spicer said. "Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but you have to think about that." Spicer compared the Obama administration's sharp response to the recent Russian hacking with its reaction to last year's revelation that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole the personal data of millions of federal employees. "Not one thing happened," he said. "So there is a question about whether there's a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response." Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, drew a sharp distinction between the two cases and called on Trump "to stop denigrating the intelligence community." "They didn't just steal data; they weaponized it," he said of Russia, also on the ABC program. "They dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the United States. That is not something China has ever done." Ari Schwartz, who served as the top cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council in 2015, said in an interview that Spicer misjudged the Obama administration's response to the employee data hack. Private talks with the Chinese government, he said, resulted in a demonstrable decline in state-sponsored hacking. "We came up with ways of dealing with them and working with them," Schwartz said. "It proves that the sanctions work. Even the threat of the sanctions have changed Chinese behavior." Trump's recent comments, Schwartz said, point to a possible recalibration of cybersecurity policy - one that could shift the careful balance of innovation and security embraced by both Bush and Obama. "We're not going back to the world of couriers and letter-writing; we're going to continue to do things online," he said. "There are ways to do it where you can manage risk, and that's really what the goal should be here - to get to the point where we can have the efficiencies and the benefits and still be secure." What remains unclear is to what degree Trump's views on cybersecurity will remain filtered through the prism of the Russian hacking affair. In his October campaign speech, he pledged to undertake a comprehensive review of national cybersecurity systems, create law enforcement task forces to combat cybercriminals and strengthen the military's Cyber Command. In a sign that he plans to follow through on those plans, last week he chose Thomas P. Bossert, a Bush administration official who played a central role in cybersecurity planning, as his top White House assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. On the Russian hacking, Trump said Saturday that he knows "things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation." Asked what he was referring to, he said, "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday" - an apparent reference to his upcoming intelligence briefings. As long as Trump openly doubts the intelligence community's ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks, he could find it difficult to identify, fend off and retaliate against cyberattackers. He has publicly compared the intelligence community's Russian hacking assessment to its erroneous determination that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction - a comparison Spicer repeated Sunday. Said Sulmeyer: "If they don't want to make a full-fledged apology or correction about Russian hacking, okay, but at some point, they're going to have to come out and explain their understanding of the threat and what they want to do about it. If we see that soon, I think that's a good sign. If that slips, I think that will be an indicator that they are not prioritizing it and they are leaving the American people at greater risk." The Washington Post's Robert Costa and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.

President-elect Donald Trump says that "no computer is safe" when it comes to keeping information private, expressing new skepticism about the security of online communications his administration is likely to use for everything from day-to-day planning to international relations. Trump rarely uses email or computers despite his frequent tweeting. "You know, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way. Because I'll tell you what: No computer is safe," Trump told reporters during his annual New Year's Eve bash. "I don't care what they say." Trump has repeatedly cast aside allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the presidential election through hacking. President Barack Obama earlier this week ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds and expelled 35 diplomats the U.S. said were really spies. The Russian government has denied the allegations. Trump, who has said that he plans to meet with intelligence officials next week to learn more about the allegations, said he wants U.S. officials "to be sure because it's a pretty serious charge." He pointed to intelligence failures over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the U.S. invasion, and declared himself an expert in the area. "I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else," he said. He added, cryptically, that he also knows "things that other people don't know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation." Stung by new punishments, Russia is looking straight past President Barack Obama to Donald Trump in hopes the president-elect will reverse the tough U.S. stance toward Moscow of the last eight years. In a stunning embrace of a longtime U.S. adversary, Trump is siding with Russian President Vladimir... Stung by new punishments, Russia is looking straight past President Barack Obama to Donald Trump in hopes the president-elect will reverse the tough U.S. stance toward Moscow of the last eight years. In a stunning embrace of a longtime U.S. adversary, Trump is siding with Russian President Vladimir... Trump made the comments during his annual New Year's Eve bash at his Mar-a-Lago club. Hundreds of guests gathered in the club's grand ballroom, including action star Sylvester Stallone and romance novel model Fabio. Reporters were invited to watch as guests arrived. Earlier in the day, Trump ditched his press pool, traveling to play golf at one of his clubs without a pool of journalists on hand to ensure the public has knowledge of his whereabouts. A member of Trump's golf club in Jupiter, Florida, posted a photo on Twitter of Trump on the greens Saturday morning and said about 25 U.S. Secret Service agents accompanied the president-elect. Reporters had not been advised of the visit to the club. Transition aide Stephanie Grisham confirmed that Trump had made a "last-minute trip" to Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, which is about a half-hour drive from Mar-a-Lago, where Trump has been spending the holidays. He returned to the estate at midafternoon. Eric Trump, left, and his wife, Lara Yunaska, arrive for a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 31, 2016, in Palm Beach, Fla. Eric Trump, left, and his wife, Lara Yunaska, arrive for a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 31, 2016, in Palm Beach, Fla. Grisham said that she and other aides weren't aware of the trip and "appreciate everyone's understanding." "We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don't anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration," she said in a statement. Trump, both as a candidate and during the transition, has often scoffed at tradition, such as allowing a group of reporters to follow him at all times to ensure the public knows where he is. Not long after his election, Trump went out to dinner with his family in Manhattan without informing the pool of his whereabouts. The practice is meant to ensure that journalists are on hand to witness, on behalf of the public, the activities of the president or president-elect, rather than relying on secondhand accounts. The White House also depends on having journalists nearby at all times to relay the president's first comments on breaking news. Trump aides appear to have made an effort in recent weeks to offer additional access, allowing reporters to camp out outside a doorway at Mar-a-Lago to document staff and Cabinet candidates' arrivals and departures. Aides also are providing information about his meeting schedule. Every president and president-elect in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when leaving the White House grounds. News organizations take turns serving in the small group, paying their way and sharing the material collected in the pool with the larger press corps. Before he went golfing Saturday, Trump tweeted an unusual New Year's message to friends and foes: "Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!" With the arrival of 2017, another New Year's message moved on Trump's Twitter account at about midnight. This one was decidedly more upbeat and carefully prepared — illustrated with a photo that included his holiday message next to it, including a hashtag and abbreviation referring to his campaign slogan: Make America Great Again. "To all Americans- HappyNewYear & many blessings to you all! Looking forward to a wonderful & prosperous 2017 as we work together to #MAGA." Associated Press

A wave of first-time candidates eager to fight President Donald Trump and his young administration plan to challenge House Republican incumbents, giving Democratic Party leaders hope that they can capitalize on the anger and intensity at grass-roots protests and town hall meetings across the country this year. At least 15 declared candidates or contenders on the verge of announcing have emerged in districts that Democrats must win to take back the House, including in several districts where the party did not seriously compete in 2014 or 2016, according to party officials. Democrats need 24 new seats to retake control of the House - a tall order that no party leader publicly says is possible, at least not yet. Still, less than 100 days into Trump's presidency, the early interest gives Democrats a chance to compete more aggressively in districts where they haven't fielded challengers in recent cycles - and perhaps chip away at the GOP's seven-year control of the House. "This is unprecedented," said Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily's List, the progressive organization that trains and recruits women to run for political office. During the 2016 cycle, her group spoke with about 900 women interested in running for school board, state legislature or Congress. This year, they've heard from more than 11,000 women in all 50 states - with a few dozen seriously considering House races, she said. Democratic strategists are trying to take advantage of the groundswell of engagement. They have moved initial staff to key districts they are targeting, including several in California, Virginia and Texas. With the first two elections over in a series of off-season special House races, the Republican party’s biggest challenge is obvious: President Trump. Republicans had hoped the protests that marked Trump’s inauguration and early presidency would peter out over time. So far, that’s not happened.... With the first two elections over in a series of off-season special House races, the Republican party’s biggest challenge is obvious: President Trump. Republicans had hoped the protests that marked Trump’s inauguration and early presidency would peter out over time. So far, that’s not happened.... In a bid to pick up as many as five more seats from Republican incumbents in California, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has moved its eight-member western regional political team to offices in Irvine, California, - the first time the team has been permanently stationed outside of Washington since 2000. The goal is to defeat Reps. Mimi Walters, Edward Royce, Dana Rohrabacher, Steve Knight and Darrell Issa, all of whom won reelection last year in districts that Hillary Clinton won. A Georgia congressional election is headed to a high-stakes runoff that's shaping up as a referendum on President Donald Trump ahead of crucial midterm elections next year. Democrat Jon Ossoff, a little-known 30-year-old former congressional staffer, fell a few percentage points shy of an outright... A Georgia congressional election is headed to a high-stakes runoff that's shaping up as a referendum on President Donald Trump ahead of crucial midterm elections next year. Democrat Jon Ossoff, a little-known 30-year-old former congressional staffer, fell a few percentage points shy of an outright... And they are actively recruiting candidates in the most competitive districts. Staff at the DCCC - responsible for electing more Democrats to the House - say they've spoken with more than 300 potential candidates in 70 districts nationwide, a figure that they believe will allow the party to compete in several long-held Republican districts like the one in Georgia where the first round of a special election this week earned outsized national attention. Congressional Republicans cautioned that the Democrats' activity includes no evidence of an advantage in next year's midterm elections. They noted that Democrats have to focus more on recruiting because they control less of the map and need to make gains. And they caution that early recruits might not line up with the demands of Democratic voters. Democrats "are getting a bit out front of themselves in not recognizing that their candidates are going to have difficulty getting through primaries," said Jesse Hunt, national press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "Their base is demanding all-out destruction and candidates with rigid ideology whose sole purpose is to oppose Donald Trump and the Republican agenda. That's going to run up against some of what Washington Democrats want to do." NRCC officials said they have spoken with more than 100 potential candidates about challenging Democrats, especially in a handful of Midwestern districts that could become vacant as Democratic incumbents retire or seek higher office. And so far, Republicans retain a financial advantage in this election cycle despite Democrats' apparent enthusiasm advantage: While the DCCC raised $31 million in the first quarter - including 120,000 online donations from first-time givers - the House GOP's campaign arm raised $36 million. Liberal activists and Democratic organizers said the key ingredient this year is the grass-roots urgency, but the hope is to combine that with organizing heft. In the fierce battleground of Northern Virginia, Democratic State Sen. Jennifer Wexton is a prime example. A former prosecutor, Wexton was wooed by Democrats in 2016 to challenge Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., but she declined - and the two-term lawmaker prevailed in one of the most expensive and competitive House races last year. On Friday, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report declared Comstock's seat a "toss up" after Wexton decided to jump in - a decision that resulted partly from conversations with fellow Democrats and partly from attending the Women's March on Washington and other protests that opened her eyes to the extent of the outrage spurred by Trump's election. "I've never seen anything like that it my life, it was amazing and very inspiring," Wexton said. "I went to Dulles Airport during the Muslim ban and same thing there. All the people who had come out to protest in solidarity with immigrants and the volunteer attorneys who were there. I mean that was amazing." A scientist in California, military veterans in Colorado and Virginia, Latino activists in Florida and Texas ,and women business executives in several states are making similar decisions. Cristobal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund, which trains Latino Democratic candidates up and down the ballot, said that at this same point two years ago, the group had held "just a handful" of conversations with potential congressional candidates. This year, he's talked to 12 potential candidates about challenging Republican congressmen in Texas, Florida and Virginia. Thanks to his anti-immigrant rhetoric and plans to build a border wall, "Donald Trump is the best Latino political organizer in history," Alex said. "I've never seen anything like it" added physicist Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a former Democratic congressman from New Jersey. Holt said he used to get one or two inquiries a year from fellow scientists interested in entering politics. But in the past five months, more than a dozen people have reached out. "There's a widespread and deep concern that there is an eroding appreciation of science," Holt said. "That didn't start in November, but now it's reached a crescendo." The landscape is different in the Senate. Republicans have a distinct advantage in 2018, when 25 Democrats will be defending Senate seats, including 10 in states that Trump won last year. But Republicans are struggling to find candidates to challenge Democrats next year. Several prominent, well-funded contenders in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Montana, Indiana and elsewhere have declined to launch Senate campaigns. Democrats, hoping to win Senate races in Arizona and Nevada, also have yet to find recruits. The National Republican Senatorial Committee declined to comment on its recruiting plan. But one national GOP strategist, who like many contacted declined to be named publicly for fear of retribution from the White House or congressional leaders, said that concerns with Trump's sagging popularity are a leading factor for wary Republican candidates. "Presumably, if you're running as a Republican in 2018, you're running to implement his agenda," said the operative. "There are a lot of Republicans who are uneasy with big elements of Trump's agenda and you're seeing that reflected in challenges with candidate recruitment." In the House, the recent focus by Democrats on Georgia's 6th Congressional District, an Atlanta-area seat until recently held by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, is part of a plan to more actively support candidates in Republican-held districts that last year voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and had never voted to elect former president Barack Obama. Beginning in February, the DCCC began hiring field staffers in 20 districts - a mix of perennial swing districts in Florida, Colorado, Iowa, New York and Pennsylvania, plus GOP-held districts that voted for Clinton in California, Texas and Kansas. While staffers are usually hired or deployed in these areas, the party started doing it two weeks after Trump's inauguration in response to the grass-roots-level organizing that sparked large marches, airport protests and rowdy town hall meetings. Several of these fresh Democratic recruits will face battle-tested, well-funded GOP incumbents who can rely on national Republicans or well-funded super PACs for financial support. Such backing has helped suppress support for previous Democratic opponents, who may have earned early buzz and support but fizzled closer to Election Day. Potential recruits say that the DCCC is cautioning potential candidates that competing in dozens of new Republican-friendly districts will be expensive and could stretch resources. "They were realistic. They're not selling a false bill of goods," said Miguel Solis, a Dallas school board member who had considered running against Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, but declined because of family commitments. He said he had nearly a dozen conversations with senior Democratic lawmakers about the race. "The numbers suggest it can be done, but it's going to take a significant coalition of independents, moderate Republicans and a significant turnout of Democrats to win it," Solis said. In some cases, it also requires getting past primaries in expensive media markets. At least two other Democrats who are expected to run against Sessions, a former NFL player and former State Department official, will face just that. That isn't stopping many Democrats from jumping in. In Colorado, the DCCC is working with Jason Crow, an attorney and former Army Ranger who has decided to challenge Rep. Mike Coffman, a perennial Democratic target. Crow said the decision was clear for him. "If we're not OK with the state of affairs in D.C., and if we're not OK with the direction of our country," he said, "we're not going to fix it by electing the same kind of people with the same way of thinking than we've had in the past." In addition to Crow, several military veterans are planning to run as Democrats. In the San Diego area, Josh Butner, a former Navy SEAL, is challenging Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who is a Marine. In central Virginia, former Marine Roger Dean Huffstetler is running against Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va. The Washington Post's Sarah Kaplan and Jenna Portnoy contributed to this report.

President Barack Obama lifted the veil on his retirement Monday at a University of Chicago forum, engaging students with a message calling on them to use empathy and listen to those with whom they disagree. "I have to say that there's a reason why I'm always optimistic when things look like they're sometimes not going the way I want. And that is because of young people like this," Obama said in wrapping up the 80-minute forum on civic engagement, the closest he came to addressing his successor, President Donald Trump. Indeed, there were no direct references to Trump, the Republican-controlled Congress or the continued attempts to repeal and replace his signature Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, or a host of executive orders the new president has used to overturn Obama policies. Instead, the former president returned to the school where he was once a senior lecturer in constitutional law and opened the session by asking an audience filled with students, "What's been going on since I've been gone?" The forum, a discussion with six young adults, including four students, featured Obama largely delivering bromides from a historical perspective of his years as an organizer, state senator, U.S. senator and president. "I am the first to acknowledge I did not set the world on fire, nor did I transform these communities in any significant way," he said of his days as a community organizer on the South Side. "But it did change me. This community gave me more than I was able to give in return. This community taught me that ordinary people, when working together, can do extraordinary things," he said. Barack Obama's return to Chicago this week reminded me of an old tradition in the Southern black church. It's called homecoming. The Great Migration left African-American families splintered, as many headed north in search of opportunities unavailable to them in the South. Homecoming Sunday was... Barack Obama's return to Chicago this week reminded me of an old tradition in the Southern black church. It's called homecoming. The Great Migration left African-American families splintered, as many headed north in search of opportunities unavailable to them in the South. Homecoming Sunday was... Of his organizing days, Obama said it was important to spend time "listening and finding out what they're interested in and connecting their immediate needs to policies that have influence on their immediate concerns." "Listen to understand rather than listen to respond. That will save you a lot of heartache and grief," said Obama, who added that it was a lesson he learned in marriage. Obama also counseled students who have an interest in politics to be careful about their use of social media, but encouraged them to "own" any mistakes the unforgiving medium may show from their past. "If you had pictures of everything I did in high school, I probably wouldn't be president of the United States," he said. It was Obama's first public visit to Chicago, his adopted hometown, since he delivered a presidential farewell address at McCormick Place in January, just days before his two terms in the White House ended. And it was Obama's first public event since leaving office Jan. 20, ending a three-month vacation that included jaunts to foreign lands and launching a series of talks and paid speeches and appearances both in the U.S. and internationally. His visit also came just days before Trump marks his first 100 days in office, a symbolic deadline the new president has both ridiculed and set as a schedule for his administration's first major accomplishments. A Trump White House official on Monday questioned Obama's decision to resume a public schedule so quickly, saying they did not recall it happening when Obama first took office following George W. Bush's presidency. Obama's office noted that other past presidents of both parties used public venues earlier than Obama. Former President Barack Obama, on a two-day visit to Chicago that began Sunday, met privately with at-risk young men on the South Side to talk about gang violence, jobs skills and employment, a spokesman said. The meeting was with participants in a program created by Obama's longtime friend and... Former President Barack Obama, on a two-day visit to Chicago that began Sunday, met privately with at-risk young men on the South Side to talk about gang violence, jobs skills and employment, a spokesman said. The meeting was with participants in a program created by Obama's longtime friend and... Some Democrats had been hoping for a resurgence of Obama in the public eye as the party struggles in the aftermath of Trump's defeat of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and tries to reformulate its leadership amid divisions between its Clinton establishment wing and progressives who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign. But other Democrats have said they must be forward-looking rather than rely on the former president to help rebuild the party. For his part, Obama made it clear that in the future he would be tackling issues he cared about — but wouldn't be doing so on Monday. The former president's event, dubbed a "Conversation on Civic Engagement," was held at the university's Logan Center for the Arts. Calls to encourage civic involvement and to end bipartisan gridlock had been hallmarks of Obama's speeches during his final months in office. "Although there are all kinds of issues that I care about and all kinds of issues that I intend to work on, the single most important thing I can do is to help in any way I can prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton and to take their own crack at changing the world," Obama said. "Because the one thing that I'm absolutely convinced of is that, yes, we confront a whole range of challenges from economic inequality and lack of opportunity to a criminal justice system that is too often skewed in ways that are unproductive to climate change, to issues related to violence. All those problems are serious, they're daunting but they're not insolvable. What is preventing us from tackling them and making more progress really has to do with our politics and our civic life," he said. Obama lamented that in today's culture, institutions where Americans often found common ground to work together on issues — such as churches, unions and rotary clubs — have declined in membership. "People don't have some of the same habits of being together on a common project that they used to. We've become a more individualistic society," he said. President Barack Obama gives his farewell address at McCormick Place in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. And with individuals searching the internet for facts that back up their views, it has "people having entirely separate conversations" and "you really don't have to confront people who have a different experience," he said. Obama said he effectively "lucked out" in his 2004 run for the U.S. Senate in Illinois because in addition to a base of support in Chicago, he spent time traveling around the rest of the state "under the radar so political ads didn't characterize me and so people would meet me." As a result, even in rural, heavily Republican Downstate counties, "People got a frame of reference that my values were not much different from theirs," he said. "Your ability to create trust and relationships makes all the difference," said Obama, who added that it's "hard to do in this current environment, but it's not impossible." "Immigration is a good example of an issue that stirs up so much passion, and in some cases misinformation, that it's hard for us to have a good healthy conversation about it," he said. One of the forum participants, Harish Patel, who lost a Democratic primary for Illinois House last year, asked Obama how to deal with failure. Obama's lone ballot loss came in 2000, when he lost by a 2-to-1 margin in a failed primary challenge of U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush. "When I thought about that race, what I was reminded of was the degree of which it was probably the sole time in my whole career I ran because it was the next thing rather than on the theory on what I wanted to do," Obama said. Acknowledging it may be cliché, Obama said, "Worry less about what you want to be and worry more about what you want to do." In addition to Patel, a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Obama also spoke with Tiffany Brown, a doctoral graduate of Chicago State University and graduate of Kenwood Academy High School; Ramuel Figueroa, an undergraduate at Roosevelt University; Max Freedman, an undergraduate at U. of C.; Kelsey McClear, an undergraduate at Loyola University; and Ayanna Watkins, a senior at Kenwood.

Republican Donald Trump leads his three rivals in Illinois' presidential primary, according to a new Chicago Tribune poll that shows many of the fissures affecting the GOP nationally have come to the Midwest. The survey, conducted Wednesday through Sunday, also found Trump holds his advantage despite having the highest unfavorable rating of any of the Republican contenders ahead of next Tuesday's election. Overall, Trump had the support of 32 percent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 22 percent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 18 percent. An additional 7 percent were undecided. The poll of 600 registered voters likely to cast a ballot in the Republican primary has an error margin of 4.1 percentage points. The wealthy real estate mogul and former reality TV star led in all areas of the state and among male and female voters, including white suburban women, who tend to be more socially moderate and are a key swing demographic. Trump's backers said not being a government insider was the most important quality in a presidential candidate. Additionally, the fragmented results illustrate GOP establishment concerns in trying to deny Trump the nomination. Each of Trump's three opponents have claimed they are the strongest to take on the front-runner. But with no one willing to drop out, no candidate can emerge to directly challenge Trump. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton holds a commanding lead in her native state over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of next Tuesday's Illinois primary election, a new Chicago Tribune poll has found. The survey showed Clinton outpacing Sanders by a better than 2-to-1 margin, with...

Bernie Sanders ahead of next Tuesday's Illinois primary election, a new Chicago Tribune poll has found. The survey showed Clinton outpacing Sanders by a better than 2-to-1 margin, with... The winner of Illinois' Republican primary gets 15 national convention nominating delegates. Voters directly elect an additional 54 delegates, three from each of the state's 18 congressional districts. The candidates in delegate contests are pledged to individual presidential contenders. It is the delegate math that leading Republicans are watching as the party's establishment tries to find a path to prevent Trump from gaining the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination this summer in Cleveland. Heading into Tuesday's voting in Michigan, Trump has 384 delegates to 300 for Cruz. Florida and Ohio hold winner-take-all Republican contests March 15, the same day as Illinois' primary. Rubio has vowed to defeat Trump in his home state to revitalize his campaign, while Kasich is looking to his home state to help launch a Midwest turnaround. The Tribune poll was conducted as several outside groups, including super political action committees affiliated with rival candidates, are unloading millions of dollars in TV ads to go after Trump in Illinois, including the expensive Chicago market. So far, however, Trump led his opponents across Illinois, the survey found. That could benefit him by boosting the prospects of his delegate candidates in each congressional district. In the Republican vote-rich collar counties outside Cook County, Trump had 37 percent to 23 percent for Rubio, 21 percent for Kasich and 13 percent for Cruz. In Cook County, Trump had 30 percent support compared with 25 percent for Cruz, 21 percent for Kasich and 20 percent for Rubio. Throughout the suburbs, 5 percent were undecided. The contest is closest in Illinois' Downstate 96 counties, which include some of the state's most rural and evangelical areas. There, Trump had 29 percent to Cruz's 27 percent, ahead of Rubio's 19 percent and Kasich's 15 percent. An additional 9 percent were undecided. Though he's faced questions about the extent of his faith, Trump still led among the 46 percent of voters statewide who consider themselves evangelical or born-again Christian. Among that group, Trump had 30 percent to 25 percent for Cruz, the conservative senator who has sought to appeal to faith-based voters. Cruz, on the other hand, had an advantage among the one-third of GOP voters who consider themselves very conservative: 36 percent to 28 percent for Trump, 19 percent for Rubio and 9 percent for Kasich. Among the one-third of voters who say they are fairly conservative, Trump had 36 percent to 21 percent for Rubio, followed by 18 percent for Cruz and 17 percent for Kasich. Trump's lead in Illinois comes despite 42 percent of Republican voters holding an unfavorable opinion of him — far more than the 31 percent of voters who view Cruz unfavorably. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 50 percent of Cook County voters, 49 percent of white suburban women and 47 percent of women voters statewide. Republican candidate for president Donald Trump. Even though large percentages of those voters held a dim view of Trump, he still leads the field among those groups because of how their support splits among the four candidates. Trump scored 30 percent to 22 percent for Rubio among women statewide, and 38 percent to 22 percent over Rubio among white suburban women. Of all voters statewide, 46 percent of voters view Trump favorably, while 48 percent have a similar opinion of Cruz. Kasich is viewed most favorably among the candidates — 54 percent to 14 percent unfavorably — though 23 percent have no opinion of him. Rubio is considered favorably by 51 percent, while 29 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the Florida senator and 19 percent have no opinion. The divisions within Illinois Republicans are most evident when it comes to the most important quality they want to see in a president. Overall, 26 percent said moral character was most important, followed by 18 percent each who said not having an insider candidate or winning in the fall. An additional 17 percent said having a true conservative candidate was most important, while 15 percent cited experience. But among Trump supporters, 43 percent said not being an insider was the most important candidate trait. Among Cruz backers, 41 percent said being a true conservative was most important. For Rubio voters, 33 percent said moral character was the top quality, while 35 percent of Kasich backers said experience was most significant. Given a list of issues to rank as the most important concern to them, 32 percent of voters cited the large size of government. That was followed by 26 percent who said the state of the economy, 20 percent who chose national security, 13 percent who picked the nation's budget deficit and 6 percent who chose abortion. For Trump, Cruz and Rubio supporters, big government was their leading concern, while Kasich backers said the economy topped their list. For supporters of all the candidates, abortion was cited the least often as the top concern, from 2 percent of Trump voters to 12 percent of Rubio's backers. With a field of remaining candidates that includes a famous businessman, two first-term senators and a governor who previously served in Congress, about two-thirds of GOP voters in the state said they were either very or somewhat satisfied with the presidential choices being presented to them, while 35 percent were not very or not at all satisfied. Only 38 percent of those voters who identified themselves as very conservative were very satisfied with the field, while 46 percent of self-identified moderates were not very or not at all satisfied. Tribune polling also found that Democrats were more satisfied than Republicans with their choices for president. Republican candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz. A total of 83 percent of Democrats surveyed were very or somewhat satisfied with the options of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders compared with 64 percent satisfaction on the Republican side. Only 15 percent of Democrats were not very or not at all satisfied with the two-person presidential field, compared with the 35 percent of Republican primary voters who were unsatisfied looking at their choices. With the election a week away, candidates and high-profile surrogates from both parties will hit Illinois to try to drum up last-minute support. On the Democratic side, former President Bill Clinton will appear at a Tuesday get-out-the-vote event at an Evanston synagogue for his wife. Among Republicans, Kasich is in Lisle and Palatine on Wednesday, while Trump headlines a Friday rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago that's already attracted promises of protests. Cruz is scheduled to speak at a GOP fundraiser honoring Gov. Bruce Rauner at a downtown hotel. rap30@aol.com

Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Topspin Democratic Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan skipped a group meeting with Republican President Donald Trump on Tuesday, a move that she says was intended to be a boycott of the new president’s policies. Madigan was in Washington, D.C., for a meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General. She declined to attend a meeting at the White House with about two dozen other attorneys general from the group, her office said. “The president has threatened our civil rights and civil liberties in a way we haven’t seen in decades,” Madigan said in a statement. “He has put Wall Street bankers in the administration to protect the greed that brought our country to financial collapse. I declined his invitation on behalf of the many Americans harmed by his actions.” President Donald Trump briefly returned to a favorite target during his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, assailing gun violence in Chicago while pressing support for law enforcement to ensure public safety. Trump said it was essential to "break the cycle of poverty"... President Donald Trump briefly returned to a favorite target during his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, assailing gun violence in Chicago while pressing support for law enforcement to ensure public safety. Trump said it was essential to "break the cycle of poverty"... The snub of the Republican president by the Madigan, daughter of Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, came just days after Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner also avoided an encounter with the new president. Rauner, who was in the Washington over the weekend for a gathering of governors, skipped a dinner for governors hosted at the White House. That's in contrast to Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat who met with Trump in December and traveled to Washington earlier this month for meetings with high-ranking White House officials. (Kim Geiger) What's on tap *Mayor Rahm Emanuel will announce that Hickory Farms has relocated its corporate headquarters from Ohio to Chicago. *Gov.

From the notebook *Senators split over Ross: Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth voted different ways on the confirmation of new Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a rare occurrence so far as President Donald Trump’s picks move through the Senate. Durbin voted against Ross’ confirmation, and Duckworth voted for him. In January, Duckworth’s office said she raised concerns about the loss of jobs Downstate in a meeting with then-nominee Ross. “Illegal dumping of foreign steel has forced American companies to lower production and shutter factories, particularly in my state of Illinois, where these practices contributed to 2,000 Granite City steelworkers getting laid off – through no fault of their own – just days after Christmas,” Duckworth said in a statement at the time. “I was pleased Mr. Ross agreed to work with me to crack down on currency manipulation and by his commitment to make timely enforcement of trade laws a priority.” In many previous confirmation votes, including for higher-profile offices like secretary of state, Democrats Durbin and Duckworth have voted the same way.

President-elect Donald Trump plans to pick investor Wilbur Ross, who became a billionaire by acquiring and restructuring troubled companies, for Commerce Department secretary, said two people familiar with the transition. An announcement may come Wednesday, according to the people, who asked for anonymity. Ross would oversee a sprawling agency of almost 47,000 that describes itself as “the voice of U.S. business within the President’s Cabinet.” Under the Commerce umbrella are entities as diverse as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which provides official macroeconomic statistics about the U.S. economy; and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which among other things tracks hurricanes and has a key role in monitoring the effects of climate change. Ross, 79, a longtime Democrat, backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. He emerged as an advocate for Trump’s trade and economic agenda when the real estate developer was still seen as a long shot against Democrat Hillary Clinton, and denounced Romney for criticizing Trump. As Commerce secretary, Ross would be charged with executing some of Trump’s most ambitious plans. The president-elect campaigned on promises to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, slap tariffs on U.S. companies that move abroad and then try to sell goods back into the country, take a tough approach to China including naming it a currency manipulator, revive the U.S. steel industry, and spend big on infrastructure. His appeal to blue-collar white workers in the Rust Belt helped sweep him to victory. “Trump’s pro-growth agenda will get this economy growing,” Ross wrote in a joint opinion piece in October for RealClearPolicy with CKE Restaurants Inc. chief executive officer Andy Puzder and economist Peter Navarro. “It is a solemn promise based on a solid set of interactive and highly synergistic policies designed to free the American economy from the chains that have been wrapped around it during the Obama-Clinton years.” Reaching deep into conservative territory, President-elect Donald Trump chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce "Obamacare" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare.

Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce "Obamacare" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine... Ross, in an interview with CNBC in June, called for “a more radical, new approach to the government” to help middle-class and lower middle-class Americans who have “not really benefited by the last 10 to 15 years of economic activity and they’re sick and tired of it.” Ross’ seminal deal, starting in 2002, cobbled once-iconic steel-making companies into International Steel Group Inc., what was then the nation’s second-largest integrated steelmaker. He and his backers in 2004 announced the sale of the Ohio-based firm for about $4.5 billion to Indian-born, U.K.-based steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, reaping more than an eightfold profit, about $2.9 billion. Ross also put together deals in the coal mining, automotive parts and textile industries, among others. If the Republican-controlled Senate confirms Ross after Trump is inaugurated in January, the investor would succeed another billionaire, Obama appointee Penny Pritzker. The Chicago hotelier was one of the wealthiest Cabinet secretaries in history, disclosing assets in the range of $400 million to $2.2 billion, not counting more than $50 million in Hyatt Hotels stock. She is now worth about $3 billion, according to a Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimate. Ross’ net worth matches Pritzker’s at some $2.9 billion. Ross’ previous dealings with Trump include representing bondholders in the bankruptcy of his Taj Mahal Casino Resort, which at the time was Atlantic City, N.J.’s biggest and flashiest gambling house, helping them to recover their debts. The deal gave creditors a 50 percent stake, but also allowed Trump to remain as chairman, according to Associated Press accounts at the time. It came more than 12 hours after Trump missed a $47.3 million interest payment on $675 million worth of high-yield bonds used to finance the gambling house. Bondholders had threatened to seize control of the Taj Mahal in what could have been a protracted fight, according to the news service. Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, is in line to be appointed as deputy secretary of commerce, according to a person familiar with transition planning for President-elect Donald Trump.

Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, is in line to be appointed as deputy secretary of commerce, according to a person familiar with transition planning for President-elect Donald Trump. Trump is also expected to nominate investor Wilbur Ross, who became a billionaire by acquiring and restructuring... “We could have foreclosed, and he would have been gone,” Ross told the New York Post. Ross, a New Jersey native, earned a bachelor’s degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard Business School before working on Wall Street as a bankruptcy specialist at Rothschild Inc. He opened his own firm, WL Ross & Co., in 2000, where he serves as chairman and chief strategy officer. Ross bet billions by combining companies in U.S. industries such as steel, coal, auto parts and textiles that were threatened by overseas competition and onerous labor contracts. Ross strove to keep on labor’s good side even as his taste in investments made them natural enemies. “Leaders of some of the big industrial unions, the steelworkers, the autoworkers — they understand the dynamics of the industry at least as well as the senior management of the companies,” Ross said in a 2010 interview with Charlie Rose. Leo Gerard, who led the United Steelworkers when Ross bought LTV, lauded the investor for revitalizing the company, although officials at other unions judged him less kindly.

Steven Mnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and later ran a hedge fund, was picked by Trump as the next U.S. Treasury secretary, a person familiar with the decision said on Tuesday. Trump last week picked Betsy DeVos, a charter schools activist who has given millions to conservative causes, as his secretary of Education. She is the daughter-in-law of billionaire Richard DeVos Sr., who co-founded Alticor, the parent company of direct-seller Amway. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has assailed Trump about what she called a slew of “special interests, Wall Street elites and insiders” joining the White House transition team. Bloomberg

Reaching deep into conservative territory, President-elect Donald Trump chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce "Obamacare" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine Chao, to lead the Department of Transportation. Both have long ties to Washington. Price, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after more than a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare — a position Trump opposed in the campaign. Chao, who was the first Asian-American woman to serve in a president's Cabinet, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The selections came as Trump spent Tuesday with advisers in his Manhattan skyscraper, racing through meetings with prospective administration hires as high-profile vacancies loom — none bigger than secretary of State. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, on the shortlist for the nation's chief diplomat, was to have a private dinner with the incoming president. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., arrives at Trump Tower on Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., arrives at Trump Tower on Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. At the same time, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein delivered $3.5 million to the state of Wisconsin to guarantee a recount in one of the states that fueled Trump's unexpected victory. Stein, who is also pursuing recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, has raised concerns that the results may have been hacked. Trump has assailed the Green Party effort as a scam and separately has made unsupported claims of voter fraud in other states. Meanwhile, Price's selection raised questions about the incoming president's commitment to Medicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedly vowed to preserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP efforts on Capitol Hill to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a change that if enacted, would likely dramatically reduce government spending on the health care program that serves an estimated 57 million people. Mitt Romney praised President-elect Donald Trump after they met for a second time on Tuesday night, saying he has "increasing hope" that the president-elect can lead the country to a "better future."The 2012 Republican presidential nominee dined with Trump in Manhattan Tuesday night as Trump weighs... Mitt Romney praised President-elect Donald Trump after they met for a second time on Tuesday night, saying he has "increasing hope" that the president-elect can lead the country to a "better future."The 2012 Republican presidential nominee dined with Trump in Manhattan Tuesday night as Trump weighs... Trump did not address Price's position on Medicare in a statement released by his transition team. The team did not respond to subsequent questions about it. "Chairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity," Trump said. "He is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American." Trump, in a 2015 interview promoted on his campaign website, pledged not to cut expensive entitlement programs that Republicans have fought for years to cut to help reduce the federal deficit. "I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican's going to cut," Trump told the Daily Signal. He later changed his mind on Medicaid, embracing the GOP concept of turning the program over to the states with a fixed amount of federal "block grant" funding. Like any Cabinet official, Price would carry out the wishes of the president. And a sweeping Medicare initiative would have to go through Congress with some Democratic support, which would be unlikely.

Bernie Sanders charged that Price "has a long history of wanting to do exactly the opposite of what Trump campaigned on." "Rep. Price has a long history of wanting to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. What hypocrisy!" Sanders said in a statement. Like Price, Chao is well-known in Washington, having led the Department of Labor for several years under President George W. Bush. Her record at the Labor Department suggests she would bring a light hand to safety enforcement as transportation secretary. Under Chao at Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn't issue a single significant new safety regulation for four years. Mine safety inspectors were cut and inspections reduced. Whether it's integrating drones into the national airspace, deploying self-driving cars or "some other new technology, she's not going to be especially inclined to second guess the industry when they say that this will be safe," said Thomas McGarity, a University of Texas law professor and author of "Freedom to Harm," a book about the Labor Department that includes Chao's tenure. Both Price and Chao would require Senate confirmation. Major Cabinet vacancies remain.

As congressional Democrats prepare to deal with a Republican White House, they appear ready to take the opposite approach, effectively challenging President-elect... After his meeting, Corker told reporters, "The world needs to know that the secretary of state is someone who speaks fully for the president," a possible jab at Romney, who aggressively opposed Trump's candidacy. Transition aides said Trump was likely at least a few days away from a decision. Even as he weighed crucial Cabinet decisions, Trump appeared distracted by outside issues — or eager to create distractions himself. He tweeted that "nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag." He warned that those who do should face "perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!" Trump offered no context for his message. The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment, and Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday he doesn't support Trump's approach. "I support the First Amendment," he said. Trump's team also announced that Seema Verma has been chosen to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Associated Press

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner kept his distance from President Donald Trump during a weekend visit to Washington, D.C., where he participated in a gathering of governors but didn't meet with the president and skipped a White House dinner that was attended by 46 other governors. Rauner did not attend the National Governors Association dinner with the president, a fellow Republican, even as Trump has made a habit of bashing Chicago over its persistent problems with violent crime. The governor's response to the new president's statements about Chicago has been similar to his stance during the campaign: He has often avoided the topic, even veering away from uttering the president's name. On Monday, the most Rauner revealed is he's been in "communication" with members of the "Trump administration" on "violence issues." "The folks who are developing the policy — different from, you know, media discussion — the policy that we're actually going to implement, we're in conversations, I'm personally in conversations with folks developing that," Rauner told reporters Monday when asked to respond to the perception that he's been distancing himself from Trump. The governor did not give specifics about what policy was being considered, nor did he say whom he was talking with from Trump's administration. Pressed on whether he was avoiding Trump, Rauner said he'd "meet with the president any time." A longtime businessman and first-term politician like Trump, Rauner is up for re-election in 2018 in a state where the Republican president lost last year by a significant margin. That alone could make being close to Trump a politically tricky prospect. Adding to that, Rauner spent the campaign keeping his distance from the presidential race and Trump's candidacy. The governor, for example, skipped the Republican National Convention where Trump was nominated. But that didn't stop Democrats from running ads connecting him to Trump, and it's likely they'll consider the same playbook in the upcoming campaign. President Donald Trump on Thursday again publicly invoked Chicago violence before a national audience, this time speaking of "two Chicagos" during a wide-ranging news conference in the White House's East Room. Near the end of the roughly 80-minute event, Trump responded to a reporter's question... President Donald Trump on Thursday again publicly invoked Chicago violence before a national audience, this time speaking of "two Chicagos" during a wide-ranging news conference in the White House's East Room. Near the end of the roughly 80-minute event, Trump responded to a reporter's question... Still, it is unusual for a governor to keep such a distance from a White House controlled by his own party. By contrast, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, met with Trump in December and traveled to Washington earlier this month for meetings with high-ranking officials on Trump's team, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is the director of Trump's National Economic Council. When asked since Trump's election, Rauner has pointed to a few friends in Trump's administration. He said Monday that he is "close personal friends" with two of Trump's "most senior advisers": former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, now Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, and Jon Lerner, a pollster and longtime adviser to Haley. "As I've mentioned, I've talked with him on the phone," Rauner said of Trump. "I have a very close, good working relationship with Vice President Pence, many leaders in the transition team." kgeiger@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimgeiger

For years, Illinois lawmakers and governors have turned to the state's road fund in times of financial distress, repeatedly using money drivers cough up at the pump and secretary of state's office to patch budget holes instead of repaving highways or repairing railways. But that money pot soon could be declared off limits. Voters will see a question on the Nov. 8 ballot asking if the Illinois Constitution should be changed to prevent the state from raiding funds intended to be used on transportation projects. If the so-called Safe Roads Amendment is approved, all money collected through gas taxes, tolls, driver's license fees and vehicle registration stickers would be put into what amounts to a budget "lockbox." That means those dollars could only be used for transportation-related expenses, such as road construction, enforcing traffic laws, mass transit and expanding airports. What's behind this out-of-nowhere push to preserve the road funds? As is usually the case in politics, just follow the money. The referendum is heavily backed by those who would most directly benefit — asphalt companies, contractors, engineers, excavators, carpenters and labor unions whose members lift the shovels and lay the pavement. As of early October, Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding has raised $3.3 million to build support for the ballot initiative among the public, including a $1 million television ad buy. Among the largest contributions is $1 million from the Fight Back Fund, headed by Marc Poulos, executive director of the Indiana, Illinois, Iowa Foundation for Fair Contracting, which represents the powerful International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150. The fund is classified as a tax-exempt political advocacy group, meaning it does not have to disclose its donors, though Poulos said it's funded largely by union members. In comic book movies, transportation infrastructure problems are easy to spot. Bridges fall. Asphalt shatters. And unless Ironman funds the repairs out of his personal fortune, big public debt issues are ahead. In real life, damage to roads and rails tends to be gradual, though ultimately just... In comic book movies, transportation infrastructure problems are easy to spot. Bridges fall. Asphalt shatters. And unless Ironman funds the repairs out of his personal fortune, big public debt issues are ahead. In real life, damage to roads and rails tends to be gradual, though ultimately just... That's led to some criticism, mostly from newspaper editorial boards, that the proposed change amounts to a windfall for unions. Meanwhile, other groups like the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan budget watchdog, argue the amendment would eliminate the flexibility the state may need to tap into special funds given the ongoing budget crisis. Those arguments come as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has spent much of his tenure attempting to limit the power of unions in Illinois, which he says have too much influence over the legislature and state government. Democrats, meanwhile, have only strengthened their resolve to protect their traditional political allies in organized labor, contending Rauner's attacks on unions would undermine the middle class. If Rauner has objections to the constitutional amendment, he's not sharing them publicly. Asked whether he had concerns the measure would tie his hands or amount to a jackpot for unions, Rauner said, "There's a lot of pluses and minuses to it." Voters will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed change to the Illinois Constitution that would prevent cash-strapped state government from raiding funds intended to be used on transportation projects.

Voters will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed change to the Illinois Constitution that would prevent cash-strapped state government from raiding funds intended to be used on transportation projects. If the constitutional amendment is approved Nov. 8, all money raised through various transportation-related... "At this point, it's in front of the voters," Rauner said. "Let's let the voters decide." Indeed, Rauner had no say in whether the question ended up on the ballot. That was up to lawmakers, who during the spring session voted overwhelmingly to put the amendment question on the fall ballot. Just four legislators voted against the proposal. The measure's popularity at the Capitol is a demonstration of what's at stake politically. Lawmakers like to cut ribbons on new projects back home, but with less money to go around amid the state's historic budget impasse, opportunities for good publicity are few and far between. While transportation advocates have called for a tax hike to pay for transportation projects, that's a tough sell at any time, but especially during an election year. Protecting those dollars through a constitutional amendment was a more palatable option. Anti-tax Republicans would benefit from the influx of transit money that drivers already are forking over, and Democrats can keep unions happy as they ask for labor's help on the campaign trail as Rauner pours millions of dollars of his own money into House and Senate contests as he seeks to diminish Democratic control of state government. Furthermore, advocates like the Metropolitan Planning Council note the change could help ease the way for an eventual tax increase to modernize the state's aging infrastructure, saying people can't be asked to pay more if there's no guarantee the money will go to upgrading roads and bridges. It's not just road builders who are backing the amendment. Dozens of organizations have lined up behind the proposal, uniting conservative groups with agricultural interests, the business community and unions. Their reasons are varied. The anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity argues the change will force more transparency and honesty when it comes to budget-making, saying taxpayers should know where their money is going. Unions want to put members to work. Businesses want to make it easier to distribute and transport products, and to make sure their workers can report for duty on time. "There are an awful lot of arguments in favor," said Todd Maisch, president of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. "For us, it really starts at the very obvious notion of how important our transportation infrastructure is to the Illinois economy. "When you think of the importance of agriculture to the Illinois economy, if you can't get agriculture products from the field to the elevator or the processing plant because of the inability to put fully loaded trucks on certain rural stretches, that's a very real and immediate concern." Instead of paying for services out of one pot of money, state government relies on a complex system that includes hundreds of specialized funds. In theory, fees and taxes are paid by users of a specific service, which in turn are used to operate related programs. For instance, fishers buy special licenses, and the money collected is then used to stock or maintain waterways. But with state government facing a severe cash shortage, those special funds are often inviting targets for lawmakers and governors looking to keep universities open, pay for programs for the elderly and provide food for prisoners. That's particularly true for the Road Fund, which is one of the largest and most flush funds because every driver pays into it through gas taxes, registration and other license fees. And since that money usually isn't spent until the summer construction months, it has all winter to swell again — making it seem like an easy source of money when lawmakers and the governor turn to crafting a budget each spring. Last year, Rauner and lawmakers agreed to drain $500 million from various transportation-related funds as they sought to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole. Of that, $250 million came from the state's Road Fund. Another $50 million came from a fund earmarked for construction. The Road Fund had a balance of more than $1 billion to start the month. If that money is tapped for day-to-day government operations, however, that means less money for summer construction projects. "I think people can recognize that it's a tough way to run any business, when from year to year you are not certain about what kind of revenue is coming in to sustain the running of the business, how many people you can keep on the payroll," said Mike Sturino, president and CEO of the Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association. "What that really leads us to is a boom-and-bust cycle, and that is an inefficient and more wasteful way of doing it." Taking money from the gas fund at a time when the gas fund gets less money is a double whammy when transportation spending already has fallen behind the state's wish list. The Metropolitan Planning Council estimates Illinois must pour an extra $43 billion into transportation during the next 10 years to do away with a maintenance backlog and bring roads, bridges and highways into good condition. Illinois imposes a base tax of 19 cents per gallon for gasoline and 21.5 cents a gallon for diesel, though other fractions of a penny are added on to pay for costs associated with environmental cleanup and underground fuel storage. The state gas tax has not increased since 1991, and money raised has remained relatively flat as vehicles become increasingly fuel-efficient but construction costs go up. "Our concern is that we need a lot more funding for transportation, but one of the obstacles to doing that is polls show pretty clearly that people don't trust government, period, in some respects, but they don't trust that an increase in the gas tax would actually be used for transportation, and there's good reason for that," said Jim Reilly, an Illinois government veteran who is now a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Planning Council focused on transportation issues. "So to us, the two things tie together. We do think that if we can get the lockbox amendment, people would be more willing to raise taxes," Reilly said. Other supporters don't see a path to more money anytime soon given the standoff between the Republican governor and Democratic lawmakers, saying the amendment is designed to take politics out of the equation. "Transportation funding should not be feast or famine. It should not be pay as you go, we should not have to rely on a governor or lawmakers coming in who say, 'We are going to spend on transportation.' We should be doing this every day," said Poulos, director of the union group. "We don't believe in the tenure of this governor that Democrats and Republicans are going to come to a position where they can agree on some kind of a (transportation funding) bill, so we look at this as protecting what we have," Poulos said. Amending the state's constitution is not an easy undertaking, and this latest effort emerged from a decade-old legal challenge by ABATE of Illinois, a motorcycle advocacy group. In 2003 and 2004, then-Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich received approval from lawmakers to sweep $1.2 million from the Cycle Rider Safety Training Fund, which is funded in part through motorcycle registration fees. ABATE sued, arguing the money came from fees levied for the specific purpose of funding the safety training and therefore was an "irrevocable trust" that should be protected. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the dollars were public money and the state had the ability to tap into the fund when it wanted, adding that designating the fund as off-limits would place an "unconstitutional restraint" on the actions of future legislatures. Put simply, one legislature cannot tie a future legislature's hands when it comes to spending. Hence, the push for constitutional protections for transportation money. For the push to be successful, it must get "yes" votes either from at least 60 percent of people who vote on the amendment itself, or by a majority of those voting in the election overall. To try to hit those benchmarks, advocates are airing scare-tactic TV ads. The 30-second spot features black-and-white shots of deteriorating roads and bridges and warns that without proper investment, "it's not a matter of if disaster will strike, but when." Thirty states already have constitutional restrictions on how transportation funds can be spent, including Wisconsin, where voters approved a similar lockbox measure in 2014. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com Twitter @moniquegarcia

Appointed Ald. Sophia King claimed victory Tuesday night against four challengers in Chicago's 4th Ward special election and avoided a runoff contest. With all precincts reporting, King had about 64 percent of the unofficial vote. A distant second was attorney Ebony Lucas, who was backed by about 18 percent of voters. Three other candidates hovered around 6 percent. King boasted high-level endorsements, including former President Barack Obama, whom she calls a friend and neighbor; Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, the ward's former alderman; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose Operation Rainbow/PUSH headquarters are in the ward. King acknowledged that support in her victory speech. "I have to take a small moment to thank President Obama. History will tell, but I think he'll go down as one of the best presidents ever," King told about 100 supporters gathered at Little Black Pearl in North Kenwood. "I'm just happy to have known him that way." King also talked up the 4th Ward as "a treasure." "We have a long, beautiful political tradition, mostly an independent tradition I hope to pick up and revive," she said. "But friends, our city and neighborhoods are facing a lot of challenges. We can't stop working until every corner of this ward and this city can be traveled safely by our children. We have to take a hard look at ourselves and really ask how we got here." The candidates were vying to serve out the remaining two years of the term of former Ald. Will Burns, who resigned last year to take a job with Airbnb. In April, Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed King to the seat until Tuesday's special election. Ald. Joe Moore, 49th, congratulates Ald. Sophia King as she celebrates her victory in a special election for the 4th Ward aldermanic seat at Little Black Pearl on Feb. 28, 2017. Ald. Joe Moore, 49th, congratulates Ald. Sophia King as she celebrates her victory in a special election for the 4th Ward aldermanic seat at Little Black Pearl on Feb. 28, 2017. King not only had the advantage of incumbency but also many high-level endorsements and an ample campaign fund. She collected campaign contributions approaching $250,000 — nearly three times as much as her opponents combined, which allowed her to blanket the ward with signs and bombard homes with mailers. Even those advantages didn't guarantee an election night victory, however, given that an off-year special election in a single ward was expected to draw a small turnout — which came in at about 18 percent. In such a contest, a candidate with the ability to get voters to the polls can score an upset. King's opponents in the 4th Ward, which stretches along the lakefront from the south tip of the Loop to the south edge of Hyde Park, tried to portray her as too beholden to the city powers that be, particularly Emanuel. The mayoral appointee sought to counter that portrayal by noting her history as an educator and detailing her long community involvement. She is the former president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council, helped create Ariel Community Academy and is president of Harriet's Daughters, a not-for-profit group she founded in 2010 "to secure opportunities for employment and creation of wealth among African-American communities." As alderman, she's allied with neighboring Ald. Pat Dowell, 3rd, to expand Safe Passage routes to local schools and worked to ensure new retail outlets in her ward hired local residents. King, a member of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus that's often at odds with Emanuel, also pointed to situations in which she has voted with mayoral opponents during her 10-month stint on the City Council. Last week, she voted against the mayor's plan for spending unclaimed property-tax rebate money, contending more of the money should have gone directly to neighborhood crime-prevention efforts. hdardick@chicagotribune.com bruthhart@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal Twitter @BillRuthhart

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has earmarked $16 million in special tax money to try to jump-start the fortunes of struggling shopping areas in eight neighborhoods on the South, Southwest and West sides, the city announced Tuesday. The Thrive Zones program will rely on money raised in tax increment financing districts to pay for $9 million in grants businesses can apply for to rehab buildings within the retail districts. The city is set to partner with local chambers of commerce and community groups to give out up to $7 million more to pay for infrastructure upgrades like new streetlights, as well as business programs to help entrepreneurs succeed in those areas, according to Emanuel's office. The commercial corridors targeted in the program are all in neighborhoods with large minority populations: Austin, Back of the Yards, Bronzeville, Chatham, Englewood, South Shore, West Humboldt Park and West Pullman. Black and Latino aldermen have long complained about a lack of attention and money from the city to keep up their once-bustling local shopping districts. While the Thrive Zones program might not have enough money to reverse commercial decline in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods, it gives Emanuel a chance to hand out contracts and build alliances in these areas. And it could give him something else to mention to counter criticism that he cares most about the success of downtown and other wealthier neighborhoods. TIF money can be controversial as the city and Chicago Public Schools make cuts and raise taxes to make ends meet. For up to 23 years, the special districts freeze the level of tax payments from properties within specified borders. As the value of the properties therein increases, the money that would usually go to higher tax payments toward government budgets instead goes to a fund to pay for local improvements. Critics have decried the TIF districts as mayoral slush funds. Emanuel repeatedly has declared TIF money not dedicated to specific projects as surpluses, returning tens of millions of dollars to the general fund budgets of the school district and other government entities. The Emanuel administration also announced this week that it would accept applications for $4 million in grants through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund program. Emanuel created this fund last year to allow developers to construct bigger buildings near downtown in exchange for payments that would go toward promoting commercial developments on the West, South and Southwest sides. jebyrne@chicaagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne

Donald Trump campaigned as an outsider who would upend years of Washington, District of Columbia, orthodoxy in matters of both war and peace - an approach that helped him assemble the unconventional coalition that ultimately won him the presidency. But in recent days, the president has done an about-face and embraced many of the policy positions he once scorned as the trappings of a foolhardy establishment. Trump voiced support for NATO, which he called "obsolete" during the campaign. He walked back his pledge to label China a currency manipulator and endorsed the Export-Import Bank, which he had opposed. These and other recent flip-flops have soothed the nerves of many Republicans who worried he was looking to upend too much of the status quo. But they could also alienate some supporters, who see Washington co-opting yet another politician elected to reform the government. President Donald Trump on Wednesday gave his full support to NATO reaffirming the United State's commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it "obsolete," a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically... President Donald Trump on Wednesday gave his full support to NATO reaffirming the United State's commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it "obsolete," a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically... On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer argued that it wasn't Trump who had shifted. "If you look at what's happened, it's those entities or individuals in some cases, or issues, evolving towards the president's position," Spicer said. "I think you look at the president's position, where he wanted to see NATO in particular evolve to, and it's moving exactly in the direction that he said it was in terms of its goals of increasing the amount of participation from other member countries; and two, it's having a greater focus on terrorism." NATO has been moving toward greater burden-sharing for years and has long been involved in counterterrorism, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Spicer also pointedly declined to explain why Trump changed his position on a slate of other issues that had remained essentially unchanged since he was a candidate. The administration has slow-walked moves toward renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, despite his railing against the deal as a candidate. And the Trump administration has approved aggressive, even hawkish stances overseas on issues such as Syria, the Islamic State and North Korea, regardless of Trump's often noninterventionist stances during the campaign. Among those heartened by the changes is Elliott Abrams, a former "Never Trump" Republican who had a change of heart but was rejected for a senior post in Trump's State Department because he was considered too much of an "establishment Republican." "I would say this is looking more now like a more conventional Republican administration," said Abrams, who served as a foreign policy adviser in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. "To me, that's a very good thing." Trump's opposition to the Export-Import Bank - a government agency that subsidizes U.S. exports - endeared him to movement conservatives who labeled it "corporate welfare" and "crony capitalism." It fit well with a campaign message in which Trump railed against the "global elite" conspiring against the common man. But to the thrill of establishment Republicans, corporate leaders and some Democrats, Trump reversed course this week, solidifying a shift he first signaled in February. "Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing?' . . . But, actually, it's a very good thing," he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview this week. "It turns out that . . . lots of small companies are really helped!" Almost immediately, the move drew praise from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whose state gets an economic boost from the bank. "Well done, Mr. President," Graham said in a statement. The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... The thaw, especially among Republican hawks, seemed to begin in earnest last week when Trump, faced with his first major foreign policy test, sided with the use of military force in Syria. That decision - which contradicted Trump stances dating to 2013 - endeared him to members of Congress such as Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had criticized his isolationist campaign rhetoric. "I think it's a product of the fact that he didn't understand foreign affairs," presidential historian Tim Naftali said of the president. "His business career didn't afford him much information on foreign affairs. He's learning on the job." On economic issues, some have speculated that Trump's shift has been linked to the growing influence of a group of advisers led by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, many of whom are political moderates and who came to the administration from Wall Street. The rift between Kushner-backed aides such as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Republican hard-liners in the administration - especially the president's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon - has only grown in recent weeks, raising questions about whether Trump will abandon the economic populism that got him elected in favor of a more traditional platform influenced by Wall Street. But Trump's backers say that, from the beginning, the president assembled a Cabinet of military leaders, establishment Republicans and business leaders who would be at home in the Cabinets of more traditional Republicans. And he has pursued policies in other areas - on immigration, the budget, taxes, and rolling back the Affordable Care Act - that have left many conservatives content with the direction his administration is headed. "The budget he's put out is an incredible budget. He's pushed hard to abolish Obamacare," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. "The tax bill he put forward is Reaganite in all it's forms, so I'm looking at a guy who did exactly what he said he was going to do on every big issue. "Both on China and NATO, he rattled the cage and got movement in the direction that he wanted," Norquist said, "and, at least as of now, NATO is behaving the way he wants it to and the Chinese might be more helpful in Korea." One former Trump aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said that the president is known to form initial opinions based on instinct but later to change his stance based on new information and the influence of his advisers. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would not label China a currency manipulator, contradicting one of the biggest economic promises he made on the campaign trail. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China is not currently manipulating his currency, adding... President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would not label China a currency manipulator, contradicting one of the biggest economic promises he made on the campaign trail. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China is not currently manipulating his currency, adding... "He has a general reaction to something, then after he does a lot more homework on the situation, he can change his view," the former adviser said. "The reason most of these voters voted on him was less because of the core issues, it was more based on the Trump decision-making, the Trump judgment." Yet Trump promised his supporters - a coalition that included larger-than-expected numbers of non-college educated, working-class voters - that he would pursue populist policies that put the interests of American workers first. It remains to be seen whether these changes will be viewed as moving toward that goal. John Weaver, a former presidential campaign aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), said that so far, the dissonance between Trump's campaign pledges and his current positions haven't touched on core promises, such as bringing back U.S. jobs or seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act. "The fact that he says one thing or another about NATO has no impact on their day-to-day lives," Weaver said of Trump's supporters. And with Trump, allies and adversaries alike are never sure he won't change his mind again. "It represents 'Trump is a New York City liberal' returning back to form," said Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist sharply critical of Trump. "People should not be surprised." But Trump, he added, "because he has a short attention span, could easily flop back."

President Donald Trump on Wednesday gave his full support to NATO reaffirming the United State's commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it "obsolete," a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically changed his stance on several policy positions, his statement about NATO stood out given his consistent criticism of the military alliance and its importance to U.S. allies. For more than a year, Trump has said NATO is outdated and costing the United States too much money, suggesting replacing it with an alternative organization focused on counterterrorism and repeatedly using the word "obsolete." As recently as January, Trump continued to stand by this position - which alarmed many NATO members - saying in a Jan. 15 interview with the Times of London and Germany's Bild that NATO is "obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror" and that critics of his comments have "started saying Trump is right." During a joint press conference Wednesday afternoon with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump said his comments led the alliance to make changes that satisfied his concerns. "I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change - and now they do fight terrorism," Trump said. "I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete." It's unclear what changes the president was referencing. NATO did add a new assistant secretary general position focused on intelligence and security in July 2016, although experts say the change does not mark a major shift for the organization and point out that NATO has long addressed concerns of terrorism. For months after the position was created, Trump continued to call NATO obsolete. Stoltenberg told the president he was "right," but described the change in far different terms. Laying bare deep and dangerous divisions on Syria and other issues, President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that U.S. relations with Russia "may be at an all-time low." His top diplomat offered a similarly grim assessment from the other side of the globe after meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Laying bare deep and dangerous divisions on Syria and other issues, President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that U.S. relations with Russia "may be at an all-time low." His top diplomat offered a similarly grim assessment from the other side of the globe after meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. "We have established a new division for intelligence, which enhances our ability to fight terrorism, and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism even an even more effective way," Stoltenberg said. "But we agreed today, you and I, that NATO can and must do more in the global fight against terrorism." In brief remarks, Trump again called on NATO members to "meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe," noting that member-nations are expected to contribute 2 percent of their GDP to defense. Stoltenberg confirmed that ensuring the cost burden is better shared among countries has become a top priority for him. Later, Trump said he asked Stoltenberg to look into collecting back-dues from countries, something that Stoltenberg did not verbally agree to do. Trump has consistently misrepresented the financial obligations of NATO members, saying they "owe vast sums" in dues and the situation is unfair to the United States. NATO members do not owe dues or back payments. Trump also thanked NATO members for condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and "the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies." At one point, Trump referred to the Syrian leader as a "butcher." On Wednesday, Trump backed away from several other firm positions that he had held for months on the campaign trail. Early in the day, the government ended a federal government hiring freeze that Trump had promised to institute, although departments have been told to find other ways to shrink staff sizes. Then, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the president announced he no longer considers China a currency manipulator, he now supports lower interest rates and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and he would consider renominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her tenure is up next year, despite saying on the campaign trail he would "most likely" not reappoint her. Last week, Trump abandoned his longtime stance that the United States should not get involved with Syria when he approved a strike on an airbase there. "I felt we had to do something about it," Trump said Wednesday of the Syria bombing. "I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. And it was very, very successfully done, as you well know."

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would not label China a currency manipulator, contradicting one of the biggest economic promises he made on the campaign trail. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China is not currently manipulating his currency, adding that he hoped to enlist China's help on containing the nuclear threat from North Korea. Trump also indicated that he might be open to keeping Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair after her term expires. "I like her, I respect her ... It's very early," he said when asking about her reappointment. Trump was highly critical of Yellen during the campaign. He accused her of keeping interest rates low to benefit the Obama administration and said she should be ashamed of herself. But Yellen has a reputation for being slow to raise interest rates, and Trump had also professed his preference for low interest rates in the past. "I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you," he told the Journal, when asked about Yellen. The president is also "very close" to naming a vice chair and filling another open seat that governs community banking on the Federal Reserve Board, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said during the interview. In the interview, Trump also inveighed against the strong U.S. dollar, saying that the strength of the currency stemmed partially from people's confidence in him, but that it was also hurting the economy. Beijing is willing to work with Washington on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program but wants a peaceful solution to the escalating conflict, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Donald Trump in a phone call Wednesday. Xi's comments came after Trump tweeted that China should do more... Beijing is willing to work with Washington on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program but wants a peaceful solution to the escalating conflict, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Donald Trump in a phone call Wednesday. Xi's comments came after Trump tweeted that China should do more... "It's very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency," he said. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University, said it was striking that a sitting president would comment so directly on the value of the dollar. "It could also be taken as an implicit threat to other countries that if the dollar stays strong and if U.S. bilateral trade imbalances with its major trading balances stay high or continue to expand, that he will take some sort of action," Prasad said. The judgment on currency manipulation was scheduled to be released in a semiannual report from the Treasury Department that is due this week. China defies international trade rules in some respects, economists say, but devaluing its currency is not currently one of them. While China suppressed the value of its currency for years to make its products cheaper abroad and boost its exports, for the last several years it has been intervening in currency markets to prop the yuan up, which actually benefits American exporters. "Certainly for the past six months, which is the period notionally covered by the April 15 report, China has been intervening to raise the value of its currency, not to suppress it," said Matthew Goodman, a former Treasury official who helped to label China a currency manipulator during the Clinton administration. China was a favored target of Trump's on the campaign trail. He often said the world's second-largest economy was taking advantage of the U.S., and that he would respond on his first day in office by labeling China a currency manipulator. He has also said he would impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on China if the country does not negotiate better trade terms with the United States. But when Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago last week, the conversation was much more genial. The outcome of the talks was a 100-day plan to reevaluate the countries' trading relationship, including trying to boost American exports to China.

It’s an open secret on Capitol Hill: President Trump wants a “big, beautiful” border wall, but few in Congress are willing to pay for it. The standoff, between the White House and lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats -- has escalated tensions toward a possible government shutdown at midnight Friday as Congress races to meet a deadline to fund federal offices and operations. Cooler heads will likely prevail. Talks are underway for a stopgap measure to keep the government running for another week or so while negotiations continue. But the stalemate over Trump’s signature campaign promise — that he would build a wall along the border to deter illegal immigration and that Mexico would pay for it — remains a political divide. It’s not that Trump’s Republican allies in Congress, who are the majority, don't support the notions underpinning a border wall. Most of them do. President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... They just disagree with Trump’s approach for a physical barrier when other deterrents may prove more effective at stopping illegal crossings. And they don’t view the huge expenditure – as much as $70 billion by the latest estimate — a top priority right now. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has called the wall a “metaphor” for border security – saying it’s one tool, among many, to protect the nearly 2,000-mile frontier.

Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) recently asked the Department of Homeland Security for more information about the wall project, saying they have “a number of questions.” “Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border,” Hurd, a former CIA officer whose district includes 800 miles along the border, more than any other lawmaker, said earlier this year. “There is no question that we must secure our border, but we need an intelligence-led approach.” And the most conservative Republicans in the House and Senate — namely deficit hawks — oppose any new federal spending, even on national security, which has long been a GOP priority, unless it is offset with budget cuts elsewhere. “People are pretty clear-eyed,” said one Republican aide on Capitol Hill, granted anonymity to discuss the situation. “It’s an all-of-the-above solution, not necessarily a bricks-and-mortar wall from Brownsville [Texas] to San Diego.” For Democrats, the wall is a nonstarter in budget talks, and an expenditure they would largely support in a broader immigration overhaul to provide deportation relief for up to 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. That leaves Trump issuing an ultimatum for the wall that Congress may simply choose to ignore as talks continue toward a deal. “Instead of risking government shutdown by shoving this wall down Congress' and American peoples' throats, the president ought to just let us come to an agreement,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on a conference call Monday with Democratic leaders. “We're happy to debate this wall in regular order down the road once he has a plan,” Schumer said, referring to Trump. “There's no plan now, [he] just says build it.” For nearly 100 days, President Donald Trump has rattled Washington and been chastened by its institutions. He's startled world leaders with his unpredictability and tough talk, but won their praise for a surprise strike on Syria. He's endured the steady drip of investigations and a seemingly endless... For nearly 100 days, President Donald Trump has rattled Washington and been chastened by its institutions. He's startled world leaders with his unpredictability and tough talk, but won their praise for a surprise strike on Syria. He's endured the steady drip of investigations and a seemingly endless... Congress had been heading toward Friday’s deadline hoping to bypass the kind of shutdown drama that has bedeviled Republicans since they took the majority in the House and Senate. Republicans have been trying to accomplish other priorities — healthcare overhaul, tax reform – and don’t want to get mired in a budget battle. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) believe they have leverage over Republicans in budget talks because of the dissent within the GOP over how much to spend on government operations. Republicans almost always need to rely on Democratic votes to pass funding bills and avert shutdowns, and talks were underway to achieve a deal. Trump had made a request last month for supplemental spending — $34 billion extra for the military, plus $5 billion for the border wall and officers. But it largely landed with a thud on Capitol Hill. Democrats panned beefing up defense expenditures without funding for other domestic needs, and the most conservative Republicans largely opposed any extra spending that wasn’t offset by cuts elsewhere. Instead, bipartisan leaders were aiming for a deal that would give both defense and nondefense accounts a smaller, but equal, boost for the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. On a weekend conference call with lawmakers, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told them the priority would be dispatching with the funding bill, according to someone familiar with the remarks. Trump, however, apparently sensed his own leverage and started demanding that Congress agree to tack on $5 billion for the border wall. “The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!” the president tweeted Monday morning as lawmakers returned to Washington after a two-week break. “Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.” The administration is approaching its 100-day mark on Saturday, and showing progress on the border wall – perhaps Trump’s most heavily repeated campaign promise -- would be a notable accomplishment for an otherwise slim record of legislative success. To sweeten the deal for Democrats, the White House has proposed a $1-for-$1 swap for healthcare funds to ensure lower-income Americans don’t lose their subsidies to help pay for insurance costs through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. But that offer put the president’s Republican allies in the uncomfortable position of fighting for the border wall they only mildly want — and they doubt Mexico will ever pay for — while agreeing to prop up the Affordable Care Act that is a priority for Democrats. For Democrats, it provides an easy argument that Trump is willing to gamble away Americans’ healthcare for what Pelosi calls the “rhetorical monstrosity” of the wall. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tamped down shutdown fears Monday, insisting that talks would produce a workable solution. “We feel very confident they understand the president’s priorities and will come to agreement by Friday,” he said. But asked if he could guarantee the shutdown threat was off the table, Spicer said he could not. lisa.mascaro@latimes.com @LisaMascaro

House leaders told GOP lawmakers Saturday that they plan to devote their energy this week to keeping the federal government open, conspicuously avoiding an immediate commitment to take up health care despite pledges to do so by conservatives and the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaking on a conference call with GOP members, offered no specific plan on how or when lawmakers might see details of a new proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act, which White House officials promised would receive a vote by Wednesday. Ryan also made clear that his top priority was to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep government open past April 28, an objective that requires Democratic support. "Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support." Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call. The call comes as GOP leaders find themselves trapped between proving that they can complete basic tasks of governing such as funding the government, while also meeting the demands of President Donald Trump, who is looking for a legislative win ahead of his 100th day in office next Saturday. President Donald Trump is pushing Congress toward another dramatic showdown over the Affordable Care Act, despite big outstanding obstacles to a beleaguered revision plan and a high-stakes deadline next week to keep the government running. The fresh pressure from the White House to pass a revision... President Donald Trump is pushing Congress toward another dramatic showdown over the Affordable Care Act, despite big outstanding obstacles to a beleaguered revision plan and a high-stakes deadline next week to keep the government running. The fresh pressure from the White House to pass a revision... Ryan's comments suggested that he and other House Republicans have made the choice to focus on the former. He said, for instance, that the House will vote on a health-care bill when Republicans are sure they have the support to pass it, according to several GOP aides on the call - suggesting that he does not believe that to be the case currently, despite renewed negotiations between House conservatives, moderates and the White House. Ryan encouraged members to continue discussing ideas, but he did not open the call for questions, leaving members to wait until Wednesday morning before they can weigh in on spending or health care. Trump and his top aides have been calling on Congress to take dramatic action in the coming week: vote on health care, take up tax reform and demand that Democrats agree to a stopgap spending measure that includes funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Ryan attempted to calm the disorder Saturday by telling members that repealing the Affordable Care Act remains a priority but urging them to focus on the immediate task of the budget negotiations, according to the aides on the call. Ryan has vowed for weeks that there will be no government shutdown, and many Republicans and Democrats have said in recent days that negotiations are proceeding apace. At the same time, Trump has publicly downplayed the significance of achieving a victory in the coming week. He dismissed the symbolism of the 100-day mark - despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail that he would meet many of his goals by that date. He also began walking back the health-care promise after signs emerged that GOP leaders were not prepared to take it up because of the risk that it would anger Democrats. "We'll see what happens," Trump said on Friday. "No particular rush, but we'll see what happens." Then, on Saturday, Trump added to the confusion with a promise to release details of a tax overhaul next week. "Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday," he tweeted. Less clear was what will come of Trump's desire to include funding for a border wall in the stopgap measure. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly suggested in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper scheduled to run Sunday morning that Trump may demand the funding. "I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall," Kelly said. "So I would suspect, he'll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding." The comment is likely to further threaten bipartisan budget talks, which were jostled after Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, announced last week that the White House would demand border wall funding in the upcoming spending bill. Such a demand would almost certainly prompt Democrats, whose support is needed to pass the budget bill in the Senate, to vote no. The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... The reversal comes just weeks after Trump said he was abandoning the health-care repeal... Aides on the Hill and inside the White House, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity, said they believe Trump sees a demand for wall money as the best way to prove that his most controversial proposals can be fulfilled. "This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules," Mulvaney said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Live. "You cannot expect a president who just won election to give up very easily on his highest priority." That demand came as a surprise to Democrats who have been working for more than a month with GOP leaders to craft a bipartisan spending bill that would keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The bipartisan talks were seen as a rare bright spot in an otherwise acrimonious, bitter relationship between Republicans and Democrats in Washington. One particular area of agreement was not to include border-protection funds in the stopgap budget, which, it was agreed, should be debated separately, after government is kept open. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said leaders in Congress could reach a spending agreement, but only the White House stays out of the negotiations. "I want to come up with an agreement," Schumer said Tuesday on a conference call with reporters. "Our Republican colleagues know that since they control, you know, the House, the Senate and the White House, that a shutdown would fall on their shoulders, and they don't want it."

President Donald Trump and White House officials pressed congressional Republicans on Sunday to use the looming threat of a government shutdown to win funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top priority for the administration as it nears the symbolic 100-day mark. Trump wants funding to be included in a spending measure that would keep the government open past April 28, a determined effort that has prompted a possible standoff with lawmakers in both parties, who hope to avert a federal closure next weekend. Trump's push for fast action on his pledge to build the border wall is part of a mounting and, at times, tense scramble inside the administration to kick-start the president's agenda, even if it risks dire political consequences. It follows weeks of frustration within the White House over inaction and stalemates on Capitol Hill over big-ticket items such as health care and tax cuts. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post that the president and his advisers remain "strong" in their commitment to securing funding for border security and a wall. "This is what the president ran on," Priebus said. "We want to get to a place this week where border-security money is being directed to the Department of Homeland Security so that we can begin surveillance and preliminary work, and then we will keep working on getting DHS what it needs for the structure." The timing promises a week of high drama on the Hill. The Senate returns Monday night, and the House returns Tuesday from a two-week recess, leaving just three days when both chambers will be in session to wrangle out a funding agreement. Negotiators worked throughout the break, but thus far a deal has not been struck. The wall, which experts say would cost $21.6 billion and take three and a half years to construct, has emerged as a crucial sticking point for the White House, with the president insisting privately and publicly that progress toward its funding and eventual construction must be showcased this week. "Congress is right to be nervous, but that's Trump's style to be aggressive, ambitious, right out of 'The Art of the Deal,'" said William Bennett, a conservative commentator and close friend of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. "Everyone seems to be getting used to that and how Trump doesn't want the half loaf but the whole loaf." In a tweet Sunday, Trump elbowed Democrats who have resisted his call to include wall funding. He chastised them for not wanting "money from the budget going to the border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs" and gang activity, in his view. Trump added that he would continue to ask Mexico to pay for the project, another bold proclamation he made during the campaign. Meanwhile, he said, he will press Congress for funding "so we can get started early" on the "badly needed border wall." It remained unclear Sunday whether moderates within the GOP could convince the White House to avoid a shutdown. Democrats have insisted that they will not vote for any spending bill that gives the White House money or flexibility to begin construction of a border barrier. They believe that the GOP will have to either abandon Trump's demand or assume political responsibility if a shutdown occurs. "The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Building a wall is not an answer. Not here or any place." Inside the White House on Sunday, West Wing aides made calls to congressional allies, while the president tweeted and reached out to several advisers, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump's tweets included a shot at Democrats in which he drew parallels between border-wall funding and continued federal payments for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Some Trump associates said that they believe Democrats may be willing to deal on border funding if those payments are put on the table this week during cross-party talks. "ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going — otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought," Trump tweeted. He later followed: "The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members." The tweets did little to assuage concerns created earlier in the day when White House budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested that Trump might not sign a spending bill that does not meet his demands. "Will he sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall?" Chris Wallace, host of "Fox News Sunday," asked Mulvaney during a televised interview. "We don't know yet," Mulvaney responded. Mulvaney said the White House expects Democrats to cave on the border wall in exchange for guaranteed payments under the ACA. But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., have already rejected a White House offer to build into the spending bill a dollar-for-dollar match in wall funding and federal health-care payments. Negotiators want the stopgap measure to keep government open by keeping spending flat, including money to keep the ACA going. Trump is hoping to open that up for negotiation in exchange for wall money. Democrats believe that voters will blame Trump for a shutdown, particularly if congressional leaders omit wall funding from a spending deal. Democrats and GOP leaders appeared to be nearing a spending agreement last week before Trump ramped up his demands. Aides hailed the budget talks as one of the only active discussions in which Democrats and Republicans maintained common ground. One clear area of agreement was not to include border funding in the stopgap budget. Democrats agreed to include other border-security measures, including money for new drones to patrol the border, but it was agreed that the wall itself should be debated separately, after the government is kept open. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among a group of prominent Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they hope to avoid a border wall fight this week. "I think that's a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018," Rubio said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "If we can do some of that now, that would be great. But we cannot shut down the government right now. Mulvaney's hard-line stance is also odds with a White House faction convinced that a government shutdown would be cataclysmic for an administration already struggling to prove its ability to govern, according to GOP aides in the White House and Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks. Republican leaders have signaled that they will concentrate this week on keeping the government open, even if that means ignoring White House calls for action on other major priorities, such as rewriting the tax code and overhauling the ACA. Trump has pushed his staff in recent days to prod House Republicans for final revisions in a health-care proposal that can win support from both the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group. And that task led advisers over the weekend to rely especially on three key players — Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Tuesday Group; Rep. Mark Meadows R-N.C., chairman of the Freedom Caucus; and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the House GOP chief deputy whip - to finalize legislation. But the White House's efforts to work directly with various House coalitions and piece together a compromise health-care package has led to private unease on Capitol Hill, where some GOP members close to the leadership have grumbled that Trump aides are setting up the party for defeat or a stumble should the tweaked health bill not have as strong support as the White House has suggested. Trump's advisers, aware of those concerns, still plowed forward Sunday on crafting the bill's language, citing the president's desire for action. There were ongoing conversations about the timing for a health vote, with Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or even sometime in early May, if necessary, discussed as options. Ryan addressed that pressure in a conference call Saturday afternoon, in which he told GOP members that while he hoped that they would continue health-care talks, his top priority will be the stopgap spending bill. "Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support." Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call.

It’s an open secret on Capitol Hill: President Trump wants a “big, beautiful” border wall, but few in Congress are willing to pay for it. The standoff, between the White House and lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats -- has escalated tensions toward a possible government shutdown at midnight Friday as Congress races to meet a deadline to fund federal offices and operations. Cooler heads will likely prevail. Talks are underway for a stopgap measure to keep the government running for another week or so while negotiations continue. But the stalemate over Trump’s signature campaign promise — that he would build a wall along the border to deter illegal immigration and that Mexico would pay for it — remains a political divide. It’s not that Trump’s Republican allies in Congress, who are the majority, don't support the notions underpinning a border wall. Most of them do. President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... President Donald Trump stepped back Monday from demanding a down payment for his border wall in must-past spending legislation, potentially removing a major obstacle to a bipartisan deal just days ahead of a government shutdown deadline. Trump told a gathering of around 20 conservative media reporters... They just disagree with Trump’s approach for a physical barrier when other deterrents may prove more effective at stopping illegal crossings. And they don’t view the huge expenditure – as much as $70 billion by the latest estimate — a top priority right now. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has called the wall a “metaphor” for border security – saying it’s one tool, among many, to protect the nearly 2,000-mile frontier.

The champagne was flowing as hedge fund executive Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah hosted a reception during the Cannes Film Festival last May to promote "Clinton Cash," a film by their political adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the production company they co-founded, Glittering Steel. The Mercers, Republican mega-donors who had spent millions on the failed presidential bid of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and Bannon, then executive chairman of Breitbart News Network, were still weeks from formally aligning with Donald Trump's campaign. But the festivities that balmy evening aboard the Sea Owl, the Mercers' luxurious yacht, marked the growing influence of their financial and political partnership in shaping the 2016 campaign - and in encouraging the populist surge now reverberating around the world. The Mercers' approach is far different from that of other big donors. While better-known players such as the Koch brothers on the right and George Soros on the left focus on mobilizing activists and voters, the Mercers have exerted pressure on the political system by helping erect an alternative media ecosystem, whose storylines dominated the 2016 race. Their alliance with Bannon provided fuel for the narrative that drove Trump's victory: that dangerous immigrants are ruining the country and corrupt power brokers are sabotaging Washington. The wealthy New York family and the former investment banker-turned-media executive collaborated on at least five ventures between 2011 and 2016, according to a Washington Post review of public filings and multiple people familiar with their relationship. The extent of their partnership has not previously been reported. Through those projects, the Mercers and Bannon, now chief White House strategist, quietly built a power base aimed at sowing distrust of big government and eroding the dominance of the major news media. The Mercers provided the money, while Bannon, working in tandem with Rebekah, acted as business partner and political guide. The family's overarching strategy, according to people familiar with their giving, is to test various tactics to see which is most effective. "The Mercers have a Silicon Valley approach to politics: Let a thousand entities bloom, and let's see what works," said one associate, who, like others close to the Mercers, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private family. The Mercers poured money into Breitbart News, the media outlet they now partly own that under Bannon's leadership gave voice to the nationalistic fervor Trump embraced. The family helped finance an investigative think tank that Bannon co-founded, the Government Accountability Institute, whose president wrote "Clinton Cash." Glittering Steel, the Mercer film production company, then brought the book's findings to the screen, portraying Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a mass audience as a captive of wealthy interests. The alliance continued with Cambridge Analytica, a data science company that did work for the Trump campaign, with the Mercers as investors and Bannon on the board. And they joined forces on a nonprofit watchdog group that is putting the spotlight on how public money is spent in the Mercers' home state of New York. While other donors gave more to support Trump's presidential bid last year, the Mercers are now arguably the most influential financiers of the Trump era. Bannon, who went on to manage the final months of Trump's campaign before joining the White House, is the senior architect of the president's policy vision. He is joined in the West Wing by counselor Kellyanne Conway, a friend of Rebekah Mercer who led the family-funded super PAC that backed first Cruz and then Trump in the 2016 race. People who know them say the Mercers, who soured on traditional political operatives, appreciated Bannon's business savvy and share his belief that the conversation around politics must be changed for their ideas to prevail. For all of their power and privilege, both the family and their longtime adviser see themselves as outsiders, fighting the grip of elite institutions. Driving the Mercers is a belief "that there is too cozy a relationship between the established media and the political class, and that there needs to be more accountability," said Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of "Clinton Cash." "They loathe the fact that Washington has become a very wealthy town because of government power, at the expense of the American people." The Mercers declined to comment. Bannon declined to comment through a White House spokeswoman. Trump himself paid homage to the family in December, weeks before moving into the White House, when he attended the Mercers' elaborate annual costume party at their Long Island mansion. In a nod to the "Villains and Heroes" theme, Rebekah Mercer dressed like the Black Widow and her father as Mandrake the Magician, a comic-book superhero known for hypnotizing his targets. Trump - who did not wear a costume - told the crowd that when the famously taciturn Robert Mercer urged him to hire Bannon and Conway last August, he knew he should listen because Mercer so rarely speaks, according to people in attendance. Just a decade ago, few could have predicted the Mercers' swift ascent in the money world. In the 2006 midterms, the family contributed only $37,800 to federal candidates and political committees - including $4,200 that Robert Mercer's wife, Diana, gave to Clinton's Senate reelection campaign, federal records show. The family's foundation was similarly low key, giving away $292,000 in 2007, with nearly half going to a nonprofit math foundation started by one of Robert Mercer's hedge fund colleagues, tax documents show. But, after the election of Barack Obama, the family started to increase its political giving, tapping into newfound wealth. In 2010, Robert Mercer was elevated to co-chief executive of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, whose closely held quantitative formulas have generated staggering returns. The following year, he began drawing annual earnings of $100 million and up, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha list. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010 paved the way for new forms of unlimited political spending - an opening seized upon by mega-donors on the right opposed to the Obama administration. Between 2008 and 2016, they pumped at least $77 million in political donations and gifts from their family foundation into a vast universe of causes across the conservative landscape, according to campaign finance reports and tax filings. Their foundation financed groups focused on international affairs, religious freedom, state policies, judicial issues and free enterprise. They poured millions into the Koch network and super PACs that promoted Republican candidates across the country. Much of the Mercers' political spending came in 2016 alone, when they funded a family super PAC with $15.5 million, including $2 million to support Trump once he secured the GOP nomination, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers' ideology resembles that of many conservative donors and opinion leaders. They believe in limited government and free markets, according to people who know them. They both have a staunch antipathy to the Clintons. Rebekah Mercer, who home-schools her four children, is strongly antiabortion, associates said. But what sets the Mercers apart is their interest in finding new ways to shape the environment in which policy issues are debated, an impulse driven by their background in technology and finance. Robert Mercer is a renowned computer programmer who helped pioneer the field of machine translation. He made his fortune after leaving IBM for the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies in the early 1990s.He bought an estate with a harbor view on Long Island and a 203-foot yacht, which includes flourishes such as a four-deck-high tree carved from Peruvian mahogany and a rosewood self-playing Steinway baby grand piano. Rebekah Mercer, 43, a former Wall Street trader, lives with her family in a sprawling triplex in a Trump-branded condominium on Manhattan's Upper West Side and sits on the boards of the American Museum of Natural History and the Heritage Foundation. She and her two sisters also run an online gourmet cookie company. She is the most political of Mercer's three daughters, largely directing where the family puts its resources, and is known in conservative circles for her unyielding and skeptical questioning of candidates and established political operatives. "They are right-wing nerds," said George Gilder, an economist and former Ronald Reagan adviser who met Robert Mercer when the hedge fund executive began attending speeches Gilder has given touting bitcoin and a return to the gold standard. "[Robert Mercer] believes in free markets, and he believes that technology is a positive force and that a lot of government is overregulating and suppressing economic creativity," Gilder added.

The center's projects include a website called CNSNews.com that publishes stories it says are ignored by the mainstream media - an early precursor to Breitbart News. L. Brent Bozell III, founder of the Media Research Center, did not return requests for comment. But in an interview with The Post last year, he called the family "visionaries" when it comes to recognizing new ways to communicate with the public. "What they are looking to do is build a movement, not just fund a movement," Bozell said. "I don't know where it is all leading, but I can tell you they are in it for the long haul." The Mercers' partnership with Bannon began in 2011, thanks to an encounter that Robert and Rebekah had with Andrew Breitbart. During a spring meeting of Club for Growth donors at the Ritz Carlton in Palm Beach, Florida, the Mercers sought out Breitbart after watching him deliver a talk about how to co-opt the political strategies used by liberals. The conservative media entrepreneur, who liked to denounce the mainstream press as the Democrats' "dominant partner in crime," was arguing at the time that government policies could not be changed until conservatives seized control of the media narrative. The message resonated with the Mercers, according to a person familiar with their views. Breitbart introduced them to Bannon, then a screenwriter and producer in Southern California who was directing a movie called "Occupy Unmasked" that featured Breitbart. It was co-produced by the conservative advocacy group Citizens United, whose allied foundation would later receive Mercer funds. Bannon, whose peripatetic career had taken him from Wall Street to Hollywood, was at the time increasing his political focus, directing and producing a slate of conservative documentaries. He had grown close to Breitbart and was urging the writer to expand his website, which originally operated out of Breitbart's basement. As part of that effort, the Mercers invested $10 million in the enterprise in the summer of 2011, according to a person familiar with the transaction. When Breitbart died of a heart attack the following March, Bannon became executive chairman of the news outlet. The Mercers' co-ownership of Breitbart News, along with chief executive Larry Solov and Breitbart's widow, Susannah, was confirmed by the company last month. Breitbart News Network, the far-right media outlet that heralded President Donald Trump's rise and was once led by his top White House strategist, is owned in part by a wealthy conservative family that poured millions into propelling Trump into office, the company's chief executive acknowledged... Breitbart News Network, the far-right media outlet that heralded President Donald Trump's rise and was once led by his top White House strategist, is owned in part by a wealthy conservative family that poured millions into propelling Trump into office, the company's chief executive acknowledged... The site was an early champion of Trump and the anti-establishment, populist movement that buoyed his campaign. It has also fielded intense criticism for airing inflammatory stories about immigrants, refugees and radical Islamists. Bannon once touted it as a "platform" for the alt-right, a small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state and whose adherents have espoused racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view. Breitbart officials have disputed charges that their content promotes racism or Islamophobia. Solov did not respond to requests for comment. According to a person familiar with her views, Rebekah Mercer has taken pride in the fact that Breitbart's stories have affected the political debate by filtering into the mainstream media - an impact that has been affirmed by some independent researchers. "They view Breitbart as a business and as a brand that gets a lot of traffic that is steering and shifting the way other outlets are covering these issues," the person said. While he was running Breitbart News, Bannon was also serving as the family's political adviser, assessing the impact of think tanks, policy groups and super PACS they were considering financing, according to multiple people familiar with his role. For Bannon, the partnership with the Mercers proved profitable. In 2013, he reported earning $750,000 a year as chairman of Breitbart News, according to a rental application previously reported by The Post. He also received about $100,000 in salary that year as part-time chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service, first reported by The Post. A strategic turning point came in 2012. The Mercers put $3 million behind super PACs that backed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, filings show, and when he lost, they became disenchanted with the Washington political class, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking. Bannon urged them to take a different approach: Instead of helping consultants get rich, they should create their own network, according to associates. In 2013, the Mercers became the principal investors in the data science firm Cambridge Analytica, which says it can target voters based on their personality types. It was spun out of a British company that advises governments around the world on how to conduct effective psychological operations. Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge's board, corporate filings in Delaware show, and was instrumental in pushing its expansion into the U.S. market, according to people familiar with his role. Other Mercer-Bannon projects had narrower aims. Together, Rebekah Mercer, her sister Jennifer and Bannon started a watchdog group in 2013 called Reclaim New York, which is using the state's freedom-of-information law to try to disclose every local public expenditure. One of the family's most effective plays was helping finance the organizations that produced "Clinton Cash." The Mercer foundation gave $2 million between 2013 and 2014 to the Government Accountability Institute, the Tallahassee-based investigative think tank founded by Bannon and Schweizer. Schweizer began writing "Clinton Cash" in late 2013, using the institute's research about Clinton Foundation donors, much of the material plumbed from obscure foreign websites. The book was release in 2015, just as the presidential race was heating up. That same year, the Mercers set up a production company called Glittering Steel, which Bannon co-founded, according to people familiar with his role. At the Cannes screening of the "Clinton Cash" documentary, which kicks off with the image of a blood-stained $100 bill, Bannon told reporters that he envisioned the target audience to be liberals who might grow disenchanted with Clinton. "I want as many progressives to see this as possible, because I think you have to understand how the Clintons, who proclaim that they support all your values, essentially have sold you out for money," Bannon told Reuters. The 2016 race offered an opportunity for the Mercers to deploy the network of groups they built with Bannon. The reclusive mastermind behind President Donald Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for "deconstruction of the administrative state."

The reclusive mastermind behind President Donald Trump's nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for "deconstruction of the administrative state." Stephen... Breitbart News, whose coverage echoed Trump's dark warnings about illegal immigrants and radical Islam, helped shape the campaign climate. A new study by a team of Harvard and MIT researchers, funded by a Soros-backed foundation, found that Breitbart drove coverage of the election in the conservative media and influenced mainstream news organizations. Glittering Steel produced videos for the Mercer-funded super PAC Make America Number 1, which paid the production company about $700,000, according to campaign finance filings. The super PAC directed another $5.5 million to Cambridge Analytica for consulting, data and ads. Cambridge was also paid at least $6 million for the work it did helping the Trump campaign identify and target voters, finance filings show. Since the election, its parent company, SCL Group, has stepped up its pursuit of U.S. government contracts. Bannon's ascension last August as Trump's chief adviser forced him to walk away from the Mercer operation. He stepped down from the Government Accountability Institute last summer when he joined the campaign and formally resigned his post at Breitbart after the election, according to information Solov gave a panel of congressional journalists last month. In his absence, the Mercers are forging ahead. Rebekah Mercer is spearheading a new group called Making America Great to support Trump's agenda, according to people familiar with the plans and corporate documents filed in Virginia. It remains unclear what relationship that group will have with an entity called America First Policies that has already been launched by other former Trump advisers. The Mercers are looking to produce more film projects through Glittering Steel, as well as graphic novels. The graphic novel based on "Clinton Cash" was a New York Times bestseller. And down in Tallahassee, one of their major causes, the Government Accountability Institute, is pressing forward with investigative projects.

Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., spoke twice last year with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Donald Trump's campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions' confirmation hearing to become attorney general. One of the meetings was a private conversation between Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that took place in September in the senator's office, at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race. The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia's alleged role in the 2016 presidential election. As attorney general, Sessions oversees the Justice Department and the FBI, which have been leading investigations into Russian meddling and any links to Trump's associates. He has so far resisted calls to recuse himself. When Sessions spoke with Kislyak in July and September, the senator was a senior member of the influential Armed Services Committee as well as one of Trump's top foreign policy advisers. Sessions played a prominent role supporting Trump on the stump after formally joining the campaign in February 2016. At his Jan. 10 Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. During Then-Senator and Trump campaign surrogate Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing, Sen. Al Franken asks what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. Jan. 10, 2017. (C-SPAN) During Then-Senator and Trump campaign surrogate Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing, Sen. Al Franken asks what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. Jan. 10, 2017. (C-SPAN) "I'm not aware of any of those activities," he responded. He added: "I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians." Officials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers' questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak. "There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer," said Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions' spokeswoman. In January, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked Sessions for answers to written questions. "Several of the President-elect's nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?" Leahy wrote. Sessions responded with one word: "No." In a statement issued Wednesday night, Session said he "never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false." Justice officials said Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept. 8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a Trump campaign surrogate. "He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign - not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee," Flores said. She added that Sessions last year had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian and German ambassadors, in addition to Kislyak. In the case of the September meeting, one department official who came to the defense of the attorney general said, "There's just not strong recollection of what was said." The Russian ambassador did not respond to requests for comment about his contacts with Sessions. The Washington Post contacted all 26 members of the 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee to see whether any lawmakers besides Sessions met with Kislyak in 2016. Of the 20 lawmakers who responded, every senator, including Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), said they did not meet with the Russian ambassador last year. The other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of Wednesday evening. Senior House Democrats are calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign after revelations that the former Alabama senator did not disclose meetings he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States during his Cabinet confirmation hearing.

Senior House Democrats are calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign after revelations that the former Alabama senator did not disclose meetings he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States during his Cabinet confirmation hearing. "After lying under oath to Congress about his... "Members of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyak's door," a senior Senate Armed Services Committee staffer said, citing tensions in relations with Moscow. Besides Sessions, the staffer added, "There haven't been a ton of members who are looking to meet with Kislyak for their committee duties." Last month, The Post reported that Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Kislyak during the month before Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, and other top Trump officials. Flynn was forced to resign the following week. When asked to comment on Sessions' contacts with Kislyak, Franken said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday: "If it's true that Attorney General Sessions met with the Russian ambassador in the midst of the campaign, then I am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was, at best, misleading." Franken added: "It is now clearer than ever that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately." Several Democratic members of the House on Wednesday night called on Sessions to resign from his post. "After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement, adding that "Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country." Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter late Wednesday that "we need a special counsel to investigate Trump associates' ties to Russia." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at a CNN town hall Wednesday night that if the substance of Sessions' conversations with the Russian ambassador proved to be improper or suspect, he too would join the call for Sessions to go. "If there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make that decision about Trump," Graham said - although he stressed he Sessions' contacts with the Russian ambassador could have been "innocent." "But if there's something there that the FBI thinks is criminal in nature, then for sure you need a special prosecutor. If that day ever comes, I'll be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff." Current and former U.S. officials say they see Kislyak as a diplomat, not an intelligence operative. But they were not sure to what extent, if any, Kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert Russian election campaign. Steven Hall, former head of Russia operations at the CIA, said that Russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with Sessions because of his role on key congressional committees and as an early adviser to Trump. White House lawyers have instructed the president's aides to preserve materials that could be connected to Russian interference in the 2016 election and other related investigations, three administration officials said Wednesday.

White House lawyers have instructed the president's aides to preserve materials that could be connected to Russian interference in the 2016 election and other related investigations, three administration officials said Wednesday. The memo, which was sent to White House staff on Tuesday, comes after... Sessions' membership on the Armed Services Committee would have made him a priority for the Russian ambassador. "The fact that he had already placed himself at least ideologically behind Trump would have been an added bonus for Kislyak," Hall said. Michael McFaul, a Stanford University professor who until 2014 served as U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he was not surprised that Kislyak would seek a meeting with Sessions. "The weird part is to conceal it," he said. "That was at the height of all the discussions of what Russia was doing during the election." Two months before the September meeting, Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. When the event was over, a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium, and Kislyak was among them, the Justice Department official said. Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak, the official said. In the informal exchanges, the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring, said the official, citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event. Democratic lawmakers, including senior members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have demanded in recent weeks that Sessions recuse himself from the government's inquiry into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. Last week, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigation. Sessions' public position on Russia has evolved over time. In an interview with RealClear World on the sidelines of the German Marshall Fund's Brussels Forum in March 2015, Sessions said the United States and Europe "have to unify" against Russia. The White House is dodging questions about whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions should consider withdrawing from the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In a July 2016 interview with CNN's "State of the Union," Sessions praised Trump's plan to build better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Donald Trump is right. We need to figure out a way to end this cycle of hostility that's putting this country at risk, costing us billions of dollars in defense, and creating hostilities," Sessions told CNN. Asked whether he viewed Putin as a good or bad leader, Sessions told CNN: "We have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the United States. But the question is, can we have a more peaceful, effective relationship with Russia? Utilizing interests that are similar in a realistic way to make this world a safer place and get off this dangerous hostility with Russia? I think it's possible."

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is also demanding a special counsel to investigate the Trump administration for ties to Russia, "given AG Sessions' false statements about contacts with Russia." And House Oversight and Government Affairs ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., called for Sessions to resign. He criticized the attorney general for keeping "secret" his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, even after then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the same Kremlin official. "When Senator Sessions testified under oath that 'I did not have communications with the Russians,' his statement was demonstrably false, yet he let it stand for weeks," Cummings remarked in a statement. "Attorney General Sessions should resign immediately, and there is no longer any question that we need a truly independent commission to investigate this issue." In a statement following the report, Sessions denied he had met with "any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false," he said.

Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., spoke twice last year with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Donald Trump's campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions'... Republicans were more cautious in their remarks, but there were signs that they could step up calls for an outside investigation of the Trump team's ties to Russia as a result of the Sessions news. Right now, the probes are being handled by the House and Senate Intelligence panels, and the FBI is investigating what the intelligence community's interference in the election to aid Trump, and the Trump's teams possible ties to Kremlin officials. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at a CNN town hall Wednesday night that if that if there is any substance to allegations regarding the Trump team and Russia, then Sessions cannot be the person to assess them.

"But if there's something there that the FBI believes is criminal in nature, then for sure you need a special prosecutor. If that day ever comes, I'll be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff." Said frequent Trump critic John McCain, R-Ariz.: "I think we have to know more about it before we make a judgment." The growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers calling for Sessions' resignation or recusal marks the most serious demands yet to remove Sessions -- a Trump campaign adviser -- from the chain of command in a probe at the Department of Justice he heads. Previously, Democrats demanded that Sessions to recuse himself from Russia-related proceedings and some lawmakers continued to insist on recusal in the wake of the latest revelations. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., -- a leading progressive and Trump antagonist -- repeated calls for a special prosecutor to probe Russian influence in the elections and ties to Trump. She also called on Sessions to resign. She tweeted: We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia. Warren followed with another tweet: And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions - who should have never been confirmed in the first place - to resign. We need it now. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, also weighed in on Twitter: I'm thinking Jeff Sessions is not the right person to investigate Jeff Sessions. Several Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday night questioned whether Sessions had lied under oath when he testified at his confirmation hearing in January that he had not had any communications with Russian officials. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., and Mike Quigley, D-Ill., asked whether the former senator provided false statements in his testimony to lawmakers. Quigley tweeted: It is unconscionable and unacceptable for a United States attorney general-our nation's top law enforcement official-to lie under oath.

White House lawyers have instructed the president's aides to preserve materials that could be connected to Russian interference in the 2016 election and other related investigations, three administration officials said Wednesday. The memo, which was sent to White House staff on Tuesday, comes after Senate Democrats last week asked the White House and law enforcement agencies to keep all materials involving contacts that Trump's administration, campaign and transition team — or anyone acting on their behalf — have had with Russian government officials or their associates. The Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election, has also asked more than a dozen organizations, agencies and individuals to preserve relevant records. The three administration officials who confirmed that White House staffers were instructed to comply did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly disclose the memo from White House counsel Don McGahn. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes denied on Monday morning that there was any evidence from the intelligence community of contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives.

"As of right now, I don't have any evidence of any phone calls. It doesn't mean they don't... President Donald Trump has been dogged by questions about his advisers' ties to Russia since the campaign. Federal investigators have been looking into possible contacts between Trump advisers and Russia, while congressional committees are investigating Russia's role in political hacking during the campaign. The intelligence community has assessed that Russia's hacking of Democratic groups and operatives was carried out to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. One official said the memo from the counsel's office instructs White House staff to preserve material from Trump's time in office, and for those who worked on the campaign, relevant material from the election. Congressional staffers have said they are not aware of any evidence that materials related to Russia are not being preserved. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said last week: "There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts and other records that could shine a light on those connections. These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved." Trump has denied having any knowledge that aides were in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election, as reported by The New York Times. The White House has launched an aggressive effort to discredit the report, including enlisting GOP chairmen of the congressional intelligence committees to push back against it. The involvement of North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and California Rep. Devin Nunes has sparked calls — mostly from Democrats — for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's role in the election and possible ties to Trump. The White House has acknowledged that Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, misled top officials about the nature of his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn initially told Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump advisers that he did not discuss sanctions with the envoy during the transition, though it was later revealed that he did. The FBI interviewed Flynn about the contacts days after the inauguration. Trump fired Flynn after the discrepancies in his account were publicly revealed.

A Republican congressman has called for a special prosecutor to investigate whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and was in touch with President Donald Trump's team during the campaign. Rep. Darrell Issa of California says it would be improper for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to lead the investigation. Issa made the comments Friday on HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher." Issa said: "You're right that you cannot have somebody — a friend of mine, Jeff Sessions — who was on the campaign and who is an appointee. You're going to need to use the special prosecutor's statute and office." It's unclear whether Issa would have any influence on Sessions. Issa supported Trump during the election, but barely held onto his own seat in November.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel's plan to create a municipal identification card for people living here illegally and others sailed through the City Council on Wednesday, but not before a handful of aldermen voiced displeasure with the idea. Emanuel, who sees the ID as a way to show he's standing up to the federal government and President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on people living in the U.S. illegally, spoke in favor of the plan during the 40 minutes of debate that preceded the 44-4 vote. "We are a welcoming city," the mayor said. "Everybody here has talked about helping bring someone out of the shadows, to help them get on with their lives." Emanuel said the federal government's recent deportation of a recipient of the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program is "a clear erosion" of Trump's pledge not to go after them. "Yes, we are helping people, but we are also creating a line of protection." The mayor called back to Chicago once welcoming black Americans in the Great Migration, saying the city allowed families from Alabama to come here to open businesses. "This is our moral responsibility," he said. But Far South Side Ald. Anthony Beale, 9th, repeated his criticism of the ID as a misapplication of funds, saying the state or federal government is better equipped to deal with the issue. During debate in a committee on the plan last week, Beale noted constituents in his overwhelmingly African-American ward aren't clamoring for the city ID. South Side Ald. David Moore, 17th, also said he couldn't support the plan.

As President Donald Trump promises a crackdown on immigrants living here illegally, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is pressing ahead with a municipal ID plan, a concept that's drawn fire from both sides of the issue. Some immigrant allies worry federal agents could use applicants' personal information from... Northwest Side Ald. Nicholas Sposato, 38th, who in recent months has come out against measures proclaiming Chicago a sanctuary city for people in the U.S. illegally, voted no on the ID as well, as did Far Northwest Side Ald. Anthony Napolitano, 41st. Several aldermen, however, said the city needs to stand up for vulnerable populations like immigrants, homeless people, and those who have gotten out of jail and need IDs to get jobs. "This is more than an ID, it's a start" for people who often don't get much government help, said South Side Ald. Raymond Lopez, 15th. Downtown Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, said IDs aren't a luxury, "they're a necessity."

A key part of the Trump administration's push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants was met with skepticism from a federal judge. San Francisco and its Silicon Valley neighbor, Santa Clara County, are seeking a nationwide ban on enforcement of President Donald Trump's Jan. 25 executive order... With some immigrant advocates still concerned about federal immigration agents coming after people who apply for the cards, the mayor sought to assure them the identities and addresses of applicants will be safe. "As soon as the information is provided, we're going to erase it so it can't be used to entrap any citizens who have come forward to become part of the mainstream," Emanuel said after the vote. The ordinance allows Clerk Anna Valencia to spend $1 million to get the ID program started, though it leaves many questions about how it will be run. It's unclear what proof of identification and residency people will need to show to get the ID, and exactly what benefits the ID will bring to cardholders. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne

Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday will propose a penny-an-ounce tax on sweetened beverages including pop, lemonade and sports drinks to help close a 2017 budget shortfall, a move that comes just 15 months after she pushed through a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax increase, commissioners said. On the eve of her budget speech, Preckwinkle spent much of the afternoon briefing commissioners on her plans for bridging a $174 million gap that her staff first identified in late June. The new tax would be combined with about 300 layoffs and elimination of 297 vacant positions, commissioners said. In addition, Preckwinkle would reduce salary increases for nonunion workers, they said. The beverage tax would boost the cost of pop and the like by 72 cents for a six pack of soda or 68 cents for a two-liter bottle. The tax also would be imposed on fountain drinks. And it would be applied to drinks with sugar and artificial sweeteners, commissioners said. In its first year, it would raise an estimated $74.6 million. It could be a tough sell, with the American Beverage Association running TV and radio ads against the proposal before it was even announced and County Board members wary of imposing yet another tax on the voters who elect them. But Preckwinkle is offering commissioners a bit of a political lifeline, saying she won't propose any more new taxes in the following two budgets, which would spare them from more difficult votes until after the 2018 campaign cycle, commissioners said. Five commissioners briefed Wednesday spoke to the Chicago Tribune to confirm the details of private discussions. In response to Tribune inquiries, a Preckwinkle budget spokesman would not confirm the details relayed by commissioners, but did seek to justify the administration's approach. "We have been forthright about the need to make decisions to close our preliminary gap while not kicking the problems we inherited to future generations," an administration statement read. "We are committed to balancing our budget over a three-year planning horizon and do not believe it serves our taxpaying public and residents to address a new fiscal crisis each budget cycle." A year after reversing course and reinstating a hefty sales tax increase that helped spell the political demise of her predecessor, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday warned of more potential tax hikes to come. Without cuts or additional taxes, fines and fees — or some combination... A year after reversing course and reinstating a hefty sales tax increase that helped spell the political demise of her predecessor, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday warned of more potential tax hikes to come. Without cuts or additional taxes, fines and fees — or some combination... If commissioners approve the new sweetened beverage tax, it would exacerbate the county's reputation as a high-tax zone, said Tanya Triche of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association that is part of the No Cook County Beverage Tax Coalition. "The County Board has created that understanding that when people buy things in Cook County they are going to pay more," Triche said. "It's not just in sales tax, but it's in the gas tax, it's in the tobacco tax, it's in all those things." That image, she said, encourages shoppers to cross county borders to buy their goods. "It's just the reputation that the county is really creating for itself, that there are always new things to tax, and taxes can always be increased," Triche said. "And you don't get that sense in Will, you don't get that sense in Lake and you certainly don't get that sense in DuPage." Preckwinkle on Thursday is expected to make the argument that the tax, in addition to bringing in needed money, would help in the public health battle against obesity and diabetes. Philadelphia became the first major American city with a soda tax on Thursday despite a multimillion-dollar campaign by the beverage industry to block it. The City Council gave final approval to a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet beverages. The tax is set to take effect Jan. 1. Only Berkeley,... Philadelphia became the first major American city with a soda tax on Thursday despite a multimillion-dollar campaign by the beverage industry to block it. The City Council gave final approval to a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet beverages. The tax is set to take effect Jan. 1. Only Berkeley,... "The president wanted us to consider a sugary drink tax to fight obesity," said Commissioner Stanley Moore, D-Chicago, who said he is evaluating the proposal. "The World Health Organization has issued a report on sugary beverages causing obesity and diabetes at an alarming rate, so that's one of the reasons she wanted us to consider a beverage tax." Similar arguments were used in Philadelphia, which earlier this year became the largest U.S. city to vote to impose such a tax — a move that is being challenged in court by the American Beverage Association, which spent millions of dollars in a failed effort to defeat the measure. San Francisco also has a sweetened beverage tax proposal on the November ballot. New York, under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, enacted a ban on large sugary beverages, such as Big Gulps at 7-Eleven, but courts struck it down. The World Health Organization has called for taxes on sweetened beverages, saying in a 2016 pamphlet that "evidence shows that a tax of 20 percent on sugary drinks can lead to a reduction in consumption of around 20 percent, thus preventing obesity and diabetes." That pamphlet goes on to say that a penny-an-ounce tax across the U.S. would result in $17 billion in health care savings over 10 years while generating $13 billion a year. Many U.S. cities have increased taxes on tobacco, justifying it as a way to cut down on its use. Chicago has the highest cigarette taxes in the nation, which public health advocates have credited for helping reduce tobacco use. It also has led to steadily decreasing tax revenue for the city and county because fewer people are smoking and smokers are crossing borders to buy their cigarettes. The beverage tax would apply throughout the county, including Chicago, where there's already a 3 percent tax on retail sales of soft drinks in cans or bottles and a 9 percent tax on the wholesale price of fountain drink syrup. An effort by aldermen to push a sweetened beverage tax on top of that fizzled a year ago amid opposition from industry and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had his own ideas about bringing in more money. Voting on yet another tax could be particularly difficult for commissioners who live in Chicago. The city in the past year has approved a record-high property tax increase and a new tax on city water and sewer service to increase contributions to its deteriorating government worker pension funds. And suburban commissioners are likely to worry about cross-border shoppers hurting local businesses. "We've been adding tax upon tax. We need to cut our costs," said Commissioner Gregg Goslin, R-Glenview, who is opposed. "We increase taxes every year — I mean huge amounts of money." Claudia Rodriguez, acting executive director of the Illinois Beverage Association, said in a statement: "Now is not the time for Illinois families to endure a tax on their groceries. Enough is enough. Nearly 90,000 jobs in restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, movie theaters and more rely on the industry — all of which could be hurt by a proposed tax." Despite the expected opposition, Preckwinkle in the past has been careful to propose only initiatives that she believes can muster a majority of support on the 17-member board. "This was the only way that she saw foreseeable that would probably get enough commissioner support to pass to close the gap on a $174 million deficit," Moore said. For Preckwinkle, proposing the beverage tax could further erode the reputation she gained during her first term for being something of a fiscal hawk. She eliminated what remained of the penny-on-the-dollar sales tax approved under her one-term predecessor, Todd Stroger, in part through significant reductions in the number of county employees and steep cuts in the local taxpayer subsidy to the county's vast public health system. She reversed course last year, getting nine county commissioners to reinstate the Stroger sales tax increase, giving Chicago once again the dubious distinction of having the highest big city sales tax in the nation. Later in the year, she pushed through a 1 percent county tax on hotel lodging bills. The sales tax increase brought in about $474 million a year, with most of that money to be spent to shore up the county workers' pension fund. The rest is going toward construction projects and to make payments on debt that accumulated before Preckwinkle took office in late 2010. Now, Preckwinkle maintains, the county needs more money for increased debt payments set in motion before she took office, higher pension contributions resulting from low investment returns and other benefit costs that are rising faster than inflation. She said county revenue is declining and the state has failed to pay tens of millions of dollars due to the county for programs such as child support and enforcement.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said schools would remain open for the full academic year on Friday just hours after a judge tossed a lawsuit Chicago Public Schools had framed as a last resort to secure enough money to keep classes in session. "The kids of the City of Chicago will be in school until the end of the school year," Emanuel said at a late afternoon news conference at City Hall. "That is where they belong." Emanuel and CPS officials said they haven't figured out how to find the money to operate schools through June 20. The mayor did not directly respond when asked why he failed to reassure parents months earlier that school would not close early. Instead, he again sought to blame Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and ended the news conference. "The stress on the system comes from the governor," Emanuel said. CPS officials promised to find a way to keep schools open and meet financial obligations that include a massive payment to the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund due June 30. "We're going to find a way to fund this," Chicago Board of Education President Frank Clark said. "This is not the end of this journey. This is not the end of our legal options, and we will look at every financial option that's really open to us." The mayor's announcement followed a Cook County judge's ruling to dismiss a CPS lawsuit against the state over education funding, and also reject the district's request for an injunction that would freeze state funding to public schools throughout Illinois. With the school year coming to a close, Chicago Public School is short at least $130 million. Here is how it happened. With the school year coming to a close, Chicago Public School is short at least $130 million. Here is how it happened. Judge Franklin Ulyses Valderrama said that CPS could file an amended complaint by May 26. City and CPS officials were quick to praise sections of Valderrama's 44-page ruling that carefully summarized the complexities of the case. "The Court is not oblivious to the fiscal challenges confronting CPS," Valderrama wrote. "To say that the State's current scheme of funding public education is broken is to state the obvious. Plaintiffs' Complaint, however, as constituted is not the vehicle to redress this inequity." Valderrama also wrote that the state's argument that CPS could simply borrow more money to solve its problems was "eerily reminiscent" of the "let them eat cake" comment often attributed to the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, in response to the plight of her people. One CPS official said that city and school authorities were debating whether to press ahead with the case. Valderrama's ruling represents a serious blow to CPS in its efforts to pressure the state to give it more money. District CEO Forrest Claypool persistently had warned the school year could end as early as June 1 without additional state funding. Attorneys for the state of Illinois asked a judge Friday to dismiss an education funding lawsuit brought by Chicago Public Schools as part of the district's efforts to plug a gaping budget hole. The state argued that CPS' complaints about pension funding and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto... Attorneys for the state of Illinois asked a judge Friday to dismiss an education funding lawsuit brought by Chicago Public Schools as part of the district's efforts to plug a gaping budget hole. The state argued that CPS' complaints about pension funding and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto... In putting an end to that threat, Emanuel sought to again blame Rauner for vetoing a bill that would have provided $215 million in additional state pension funding. "The kids of the city of Chicago will be in school 'til the end of the school year," Emanuel said. "That is where they belong. The governor and the General Assembly belong in Springfield…creating for the first time ever equitable funding for children across the state of Illinois." Emanuel did not mention other factors behind CPS' budget woes: The district skipped years of payments into the teacher pension system, and now the district must make larger payments to try to make up a massive shortfall. CPS has also used some of its state aid dollars to finance a mountain of expensive debt. And the mayor did not note that the extra money for CPS was contingent on a deal being struck on statewide pension reform. Emanuel did not offer specifics on where he'd find the money to keep schools open, saying that the idea of loaning CPS money from the city's special taxing district funds was just one possibility among many. "We're going to look at all options, and look at every avenue. That's an idea," the mayor said. "There are other ideas on the table. I'll tell you what's not on the table. That's missing a single day of school. That's not an option. That's off the table." Chicago Public Schools upped the stakes of its legal challenge to state education funding on Monday, warning that the school year could end nearly three weeks early and summer school programs could be cut if the district doesn't get a quick and favorable ruling. "These possibilities are deeply... Chicago Public Schools upped the stakes of its legal challenge to state education funding on Monday, warning that the school year could end nearly three weeks early and summer school programs could be cut if the district doesn't get a quick and favorable ruling. "These possibilities are deeply... Aldermen were initially told briefings would be held this week to discuss options, but those sessions have been put off to next week, said Ald. George Cardenas, 12th. Cardenas also talked about the idea of the city loaning money to CPS from tax increment finance district funds. "The administration feels that — let's wait until the Springfield chaos sort of gets resolved, and in the meantime something can be worked out in the short term," he said. "And obviously, the intent is to keep schools open, and so you have to look at what options you have, and that's one of the options." One budget Band-Aid under discussion would involve delaying payments to CPS vendors, CPS sources said. Some vendors may have to wait to see paychecks from the district anyway, one official said, because the state still owes CPS more than $400 million in grants that finance certain programs but are also used by the district for operating expenses. Claypool said Emanuel "has committed to us that he will use the powers of his office in the coming days and the coming weeks to help us find a way." "I wish I could stand here today and tell you how we will do that, but I am confident the mayor's success, given his position and his history, that we will find that way," Claypool said. The district's lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the state discriminates against its largely impoverished and minority students, and violates Illinois civil rights law, by contributing more money to teacher pensions in the suburbs and downstate than Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at a news conference at City Hall in Chicago on April 28, 2017. Emanuel said Chicago Public Schools won't end classes early this year.

Valderrama concluded that the district's request to halt the state from distributing funds to any public school or public school teacher pension fund did not fulfill the "fundamental purpose" of a preliminary injunction. The judge said such a request "would do nothing to prevent the harms Plaintiffs allege and, in fact, would exacerbate those harms by depriving CPS of all sources of State funding." Valderrama wrote that the school district failed to tie its discrimination claims to any state "program or activity" as required by the Illinois Civil Rights Act. "While the Complaint alleges 'discriminatory practices,' the Complaint fails to identify the alleged 'discriminatory practices' and fails to link their allegation to criteria or methods of administration," Valderrama wrote. In a statement, Gov. Bruce Rauner's office applauded the judge's decision. "With this distraction behind us, we can move forward on working with the General Assembly to fix our state's school funding formula," the statement said. jjperez@tribpub.com Twitter @PerezJr hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Topspin Gov. Bruce Rauner says he’s settling into his new digs on the state fairgrounds after moving out of the 162-year-old Executive Mansion during renovations, though the ambiance apparently is a tad questionable. “It’s perfectly fine,” Rauner said of the modest brick bungalow he now occupies when in Springfield, which is usually reserved for the state’s agriculture director during the fair. “It’s actually very romantic because our bedroom windows overlook the goat pens. … It’s like, whoa boy.” Rauner added it was probably a good thing that wife Diana traveled frequently for her job as the head of an early childhood education group. The governor was asked about the move after speaking to a friendly crowd of business groups in Springfield on Wednesday. Beyond the goats, Rauner also said he’s had to find alternative housing for his hunting dog, Stella, after they discovered a family of foxes living under the stairs. Rauner said he was hoping to avoid a “social media event.” “She’s an aggressive bird dog, she's a hunting dog and I learned my first morning that there’s a den of foxes under the stairs, so a mom and six little pups,” Rauner told the audience. “So Stella is not with me right now, she is being kept in another place where we don’t have to have an interaction that would be very unproductive. “So I hope these puppies grow fast and move on,” said Rauner, whose office later indicated Stella is spending "some time up north." “That would be a great thing.” The Rauners, who owned at least nine homes as of late 2013, moved out last week. The governor’s office posted video and photos of the governor loading bags into the rear of his 1993 Volkswagen van, moving the last few items after crews spent the past several weeks packing antique furniture for storage. Diana Rauner has led efforts to renovate the mansion by raising private money. Officials have said that $14 million has been raised and pledged to date, with $1 million coming from the Rauners themselves. The Executive Mansion has long been in disrepair and hasn't undergone a major overhaul since the early 1970s. A Tribune walk-through in 2015 revealed water stains, buckling wallpaper and a hole in the ceiling of a bedroom honoring a former governor — all housed in a crumbling exterior hidden by overgrown landscaping.

From the notebook *Violence prevention funding: A group of minority lawmakers is pushing a bill to dole out $56 million in funding for violence prevention programs, saying gun violence has spiked as community programs go without funding during the budget impasse. The legislation would see $2 million grants given out to groups in 28 districts across the state that have seen high levels of violence, including several in the Chicago area. The money would be earmarked for youth services, after-school programs, summer jobs and other initiatives. Lawmakers contend the funding is crucial to help vulnerable communities that have been hurt further by a state budget impasse that continues to squeeze human service agencies. “We know for a fact that gun violence in the state has seen a sharp increase since our budget impasse began,” said Rep. Sonya Harper, D-Chicago. “This is no coincidence.” The money would come from the state’s main checking account, something that could prove challenging given Democrats who control the General Assembly have been unable to reach agreement on a full spending plan with Republican Gov. Rauner for nearly two years. “We have to, absolutely have to, invest in funding programs that we know will address the violence that’s already occurring, help prevent future violence, and to provide some type of trauma care for those who are the victims of that violence,” said Rep. Litesa Wallace, D-Rockford.

President Donald Trump returned to his populist "America first" message Tuesday, visiting a state key to his presidential victory where he signed an executive order to discourage businesses from hiring low-wage workers abroad and to require the government to buy more from U.S. firms. Appearing at the southeast Wisconsin headquarters of Snap-on Inc., a tool, automotive and industrial diagnostics equipment manufacturer and distributor, Trump tried to bolster his "Buy American, Hire American" campaign pledge. During his remarks, Trump also promised quick work on tax reform — though Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who also attended, has said such action isn't likely to begin until August at the earliest. In addition, the president urged that action on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, take place first despite ongoing divides within the Republican-controlled Congress on how to do it. And Trump once again said the North American Free Trade Agreement should be scrapped unless major changes to benefit U.S. firms and workers could be achieved. "Together, we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that more products are stamped with those wonderful words, 'Made in the USA,'" Trump said, paying homage to the Snap-on workforce in lauding the value of U.S. jobs to rebuild the country. "For too long we have watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other, faraway lands," the president said. "This election, the American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity. They voted to bring back their jobs and to bring back their dreams into our country." When controversies emerge, Trump frequently heads out of the White House for campaign-style rallies. The president has found himself facing questions about reversals involving U.S. military actions in Syria and Afghanistan, growing tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and a declaration that China does not manipulate its currency. Trump, now needing China to help defuse the U.S. situation with North Korea, had declared China a currency manipulator during the campaign. A Pew Research Center poll released the day before Trump's visit found the president's national approval rating unchanged from two months ago at 39 percent. The percentage of Americans who disapprove was about the same: 54 percent compared with 56 percent in February. Though manufacturing no longer takes place at Snap-on's Kenosha campus — that's done at 10 other U.S. sites including nearby Milwaukee — Trump returned to a comfortable theme of pledging to restore domestic manufacturing to improve the nation's economy and spur job growth. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that could restrict immigrant workers and foreign goods — though the steps outlined were modest and details were thin. Here's what we know about Trump's "Buy American, Hire American" executive order, which he signed during an appearance in... President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that could restrict immigrant workers and foreign goods — though the steps outlined were modest and details were thin. Here's what we know about Trump's "Buy American, Hire American" executive order, which he signed during an appearance in... In signing the executive order, Trump said, "American projects should be made with American goods. No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of federal contracts." The president also said the order was "designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the United States." "We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first. Does that make sense?" he asked during his 20-minute speech. "Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay. This will stop." The executive order Trump signed will affect the issuance of what is known as H-1B visas, which are often used by technology companies to recruit workers from foreign countries. During the campaign, Trump was critical of the visa program and pledged to end it, saying firms were using it to import cheap labor at the expense of U.S. jobs. Under the program, the government admits about 85,000 immigrants each year, largely for work in high-technology jobs. The executive order falls short of ending the program but dramatically restructures it by requiring applicants and their potential employers to show that the visas are going only to "the most highly skilled workers" in their fields. The order also directs all federal agencies to re-examine waivers and exceptions to government rules and trade agreements that require a preference for purchasing from American companies. "With this action we are sending a powerful signal to the world: We're going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first," Trump said. Job growth, particularly in manufacturing, has been key to Trump's "Make America Great Again" mantra — vowing to "bring back" the jobs of voters who have felt the sting of employment losses and regional economic declines as manufacturing jobs moved out of the country because of globalization or were overtaken by automation. As a private citizen, Donald Trump eschewed any sort of intervention in Syria. “We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA,” he boomed on Twitter in September 2013. That “America first” philosophy energized... As a private citizen, Donald Trump eschewed any sort of intervention in Syria. “We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA,” he boomed on Twitter in September 2013. That “America first” philosophy energized... Snap-on CEO Nicholas Pinchuk noted the "interesting times" of a shrinking middle class, saying "the traditional strength of America has always been the great middle, making things and keeping them running." Hailing the performance of his company and pointing to a need for more skilled workers, Pinchuk said the "timeless principle" it was founded upon, "respect for the dignity of work," is in "eclipse" and the type of skilled labor his workers perform is now viewed as a "consolation prize" in an era of technology. Approaching the 100-day mark of his presidency with few major accomplishments to point to, Trump maintained that "no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days, that includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement — we love our law enforcement — and on government reform." The president promised to bring forward a tax reform plan that would "make our industries more competitive and also to provide a level playing field for our workers." "We don't have a level playing field, believe me. You're going to have one very soon. And our tax reform and tax plan is coming along very well. It's going to be out very soon," he said. Trump only briefly touched on his use of the country's military might in attacks on Syria and in Afghanistan, indicating it was a show of strength. "No matter the circumstances, everyone will know, we act from this core conviction — that America's strength must be unmatched and its first priority, unquestioned, the safety and security of our citizens. This is the surest path to a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all," he said. Joining Trump for his speech was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a onetime Republican rival for the presidency, along with Reince Priebus, the Kenosha native who is Trump's chief of staff after having served as Republican National Committee chairman. Trump's visit took place in the congressional district of Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who did not attend because of a previously scheduled European trip to NATO countries. At one point, Trump referred to Ryan as "Ron" in saying the speaker was urging NATO countries to increase their contributions to the alliance. The "Ron" reference came after Trump had introduced Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Trump frequently referenced his November win of Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes. He defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 27,000 votes to become the first Republican to win the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump won Kenosha County, the site of Tuesday's visit, by fewer than 300 votes. Unemployment in the county is at 5.1 percent, up from 4.2 percent in December, when Trump and his then-running mate Mike Pence made a postelection visit to Wisconsin as part of a victory tour. Trump had been scheduled to visit Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee in early February but canceled. rap30@aol.com Twitter @rap30

Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Topspin Former Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilson is following up on his personal efforts to bond nonviolent offenders out of Cook County Jail, launching a cable TV ad buy backing legislation in Springfield aimed at abolishing cash bond for those charged with low-level offenses. Based on cable ad data, the ads are supposed to begin Monday and run for about a month on cable systems primarily on Chicago’s South Side. Wilson’s foundation is paying $8,235 to run more than 1,300 spots on the BET Network, CNN and OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network, the cable data show. The spots weren’t available to be previewed, but Wilson has bailed out at least 110 defendants charged with nonviolent misdemeanors who couldn’t post cash bond. Wilson, a gospel music TV host and distributor of plastic gloves, made an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2015 and followed it up with an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has said his personal efforts to post cash bond for alleged offenders in the Cook County Jail would help spur efforts on behalf of the legislation, which is pending in Springfield, calling it “discrimination.” Last week, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced that prosecutors in her office would no longer oppose the release of some detainees held on nonviolent offenses simply because they cannot afford to pay cash bonds of up to $1,000 at a time. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart is backing Foxx’s move and has supported Wilson’s efforts as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce the county jail’s population.

He said, “Town hall meetings tend to be platforms for people to shout at one another and get angry at one another and leave more upset and disappointed and bent out of shape than when people came. And the proof of that is just look at the national news.” Instead, Roskam held a telephone town hall meeting but received complaints that the platform was too controlled for people to truly voice their concerns about such issues as Donald Trump’s presidency and the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Roskam is a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee and is the panel’s tax policy chair. Democrats have stepped up their criticism of Roskam, who easily won re-election despite seeing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton win the balloting in his west and northwest suburban congressional district. (Rick Pearson) *Big gig for Roskam staffer: Rep.

Senate Democrats secured enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, making it all but certain that Republicans will change the rules of the U.S. Senate to ensure his confirmation later this week. Democratic opposition to Gorsuch has been building for days, and four more senators announced on Monday that they would vote against him. That gives Democrats the requisite 41 senators to block a procedural vote and compel President Trump and Republicans either to withdraw Gorsuch's nomination or to change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement. "This is a new low," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in response to Democratic opposition. But he also reiterated his vow that Gorsuch will be confirmed by Friday despite the likelihood of a filibuster. That's because McConnell is prepared to invoke what is known as the "nuclear option" - a change in rules allowing Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with a simple-majority vote. With 52 seats, Republicans would then have enough votes to secure Trump's first selection for the high court. The procedural vote known as cloture has long set the Senate apart from the House of Representatives - and it has long been hailed by members of the upper chamber for requiring bipartisan cooperation, and forcing consensus, on major legislation or confirmation votes. If that step is eliminated, the Senate is "headed to a world where you don't need one person from the other side to pick a judge," warned Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. "And what does that mean? That means the judges are going to be more ideological, not less. It means that every Senate seat is going to be a referendum on the Supreme Court … The damage done to the Senate is going to be real." McConnell won't be the first to go nuclear, however. Now-retired Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., first invoked the option in 2013 when he was majority leader, allowing non-Supreme Court presidential appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority. Sen. Dick Durbin joined fellow Democrats in opposing Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court on Monday during a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel approved the nomination in a party-line vote, 11-9. The committee's approval clears the way for debate on the Senate floor and a final... Sen. Dick Durbin joined fellow Democrats in opposing Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court on Monday during a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel approved the nomination in a party-line vote, 11-9. The committee's approval clears the way for debate on the Senate floor and a final... And McConnell will probably face more pressure to eliminate the 60-vote requirement in other cases - on budget bills, for instance, or for that matter on any legislation at all. If that happens, the need for bipartisan cooperation could disappear entirely from the Senate. Graham's comments came as the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to refer Gorsuch's nomination to the full Senate, which is expected to begin debating the pick on Tuesday. The procedural step that Democrats have the votes to block is expected by Thursday, but if McConnell at that point seeks a rules change - which would succeed with a simple majority - it would start the clock for a final confirmation vote some time on Friday. The outcome of the Judiciary Committee's vote was never in doubt - Republicans hold a majority of seats on the panel, and Gorsuch was approved on a party-line vote. But the testy hearing foreshadowed what is likely to be a combative floor debate over the merits of Trump's selection and the way both parties have behaved during years of feuding over the makeup of the federal court system. It was the Republican talking point of the Sunday talk shows: If Democrats delay Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court this week, Republicans said, it would be an affront to history — the first time a nominee to the high court had been filibustered. True? Only in a narrow sense. Partisanship... It was the Republican talking point of the Sunday talk shows: If Democrats delay Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court this week, Republicans said, it would be an affront to history — the first time a nominee to the high court had been filibustered. True? Only in a narrow sense. Partisanship... Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Christopher Coons, D-Del., and Mark Warner, D-Va., indicated on Monday that they would oppose Gorsuch and vote against cloture - the motion to end a filibuster that is required to hold a final up-or-down confirmation vote. During an hours-long committee hearing, Leahy criticized Gorsuch's answers during his marathon confirmation hearing as "excruciatingly evasive." He said that a GOP move to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees would damage the Senate, but he argued that he had to vote his conscience, even if it pushes Republicans to change the rules. "I cannot vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk," he said, "because I fear that the Senate I would be defending no longer exists." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, shot back, blaming Democrats for years of partisan bickering over judicial nominees that they say started when President George W. Bush made several nominations for federal court vacancies earlier this century. "I disagree with those who somehow say this is the end of the Senate as we know it," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. "This is a restoration of the status quo ante before our Democratic colleagues directed this artificial 60-vote requirement." Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., dismissed Republican attempts to blame Democrats for the change. "I'm sure we could trace it all the way back to the Hamilton-Burr duel," he quipped. "The answer isn't to change the rules," he added. "The answer is to change the nominee." In a sign that there is almost no hope of ending the impasse without a rules change, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. - who helped quell previous fights about judicial nominees - said that this time, he is standing with fellow Republicans. "I have to. I have no choice," he told reporters, explaining that he must vote for a change "because we need to confirm Gorsuch." McCain has been part of fruitless attempts to reach a bipartisan agreement in recent days, including consultations with Coons and Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W. Va., late last week. McCain told reporters that he was part of a similar conversation on Monday, but he did not elaborate. Manchin is one of three moderate Democrats who plan to vote for Gorsuch, and with Republicans, to end the filibuster. Manchin and the other two moderates, Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., have been the focus of a $10 million ad campaign by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which is pressuring Democrats facing reelection next year in states that Trump won in November to vote for Gorsuch. Meanwhile, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., on Monday became the fourth Democrat to say he would join Republicans in trying to end the filibuster. But in a sign of the incredible political pressure he faces as he votes on a nominee from his home state, Bennet did not state whether he plans to support or oppose Gorsuch. He has also faced pressure from JCN to back Gorsuch. So far he is the only Democratic senator not up for reelection in 2018 opposing the filibuster. Carrie Severino, JCN's chief counsel and policy director, said on Monday that in the face of "unprecedented obstruction by Democrats, Republicans now have no choice but to invoke the "constitutional option" - also known as the nuclear option - to confirm Gorsuch. Gorsuch was nominated by Trump on Jan. 31 and spent weeks privately meeting with senators and preparing for his confirmation hearing. He was questioned by the Judiciary Committee last month for almost 20 hours over three days, answering nearly 1,200 questions and later sending about 70 pages of answers to written follow-up questions, according to a team of White House officials assisting with his nomination. As of Friday, Gorsuch had met with 78 senators - all but some of the most conservative and liberal lawmakers whose votes are likely to fall along party lines. Three first-term Democratic senators, Catherine Cortez Masto, Nev., Tammy Duckworth, Ill., and Kamala Harris, Calif., complained that they were unable to get a face-to-face meeting with the nominee or offered the opportunity. This week's anticipated change in Senate procedure dates to 2013, when Democrats, angered by Republican opposition to then-President Obama's nominees end filibusters of executive branch and lower-court nominees, prompting Republicans to warn that there might one day be retribution. "Changing the rules is almost inevitable; it's only a question of when," said Norm Ornstein, a longtime congressional expert and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Ornstein warned that with Republicans set to extend the filibuster ban to Supreme Court nominees, they may soon face pressure to end filibusters of legislation to keep major health-care and tax reform bills passed by the GOP-led House from stalling in the more closely-divided Senate. McConnell, R-Ky., "will resist the change in some cases because it's in his interest not only when he's in the minority again but also to be able to rely on Democrats when the House sends you crazy things," Ornstein said. "And because it's not clear they have the 51 votes necessary to change the rules for filibusters on legislation." But McConnell said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday that "I don't think the legislative filibuster is in danger." Schumer, appearing on the same program, agreed: "I don't think there's any thirst to change the legislative rules. Most Democrats and most Republicans have served in both the minority and majority and know what it means." The Washington Post's Amber Phillips contributed to this report.

FBI Director James B. Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will appear Monday before the House Intelligence Committee to speak about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential connections between President Donald Trump's inner circle and the Kremlin. It is the first time Comey and Rogers have testified publicly since Trump took office two months ago - a period during which Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from Trump-related investigations. In recent weeks, Trump joined the fray with counter-accusations of his own, such as his unfounded charge that the Obama administration conducted a wiretap of his phones at Trump Tower in New York. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee confirmed on "Fox News Sunday" that there was no evidence to suggest that Trump was wiretapped. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he has seen Justice Department documents requested by the panel confirming that information; they were turned over to his committee Friday. "Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction," Nunes said. The Intelligence Committee hearing is the opening foray into getting public answers on these topics. On March 28, former spy chiefs and administration officials will also appear before the panel to give their take on what, if anything, transpired between Trump's team and Russian officials during the heat of the presidential campaign. But even as intelligence officials publicly answer lawmakers' questions, political jockeying is casting a cloud over efforts to probe how deep the counterintelligence investigation involving the president's inner circle really goes. Here are five things to watch at Monday's House Intelligence Committee hearing, which begins at 10 a.m.: 1. Can Republicans stop the bleeding? Can Democrats unearth a smoking gun? Republicans have been scrambling to help the president avoid the specter of scandal since allegations first surfaced about contacts between Trump's team and Russian officials. Nunes has repeatedly said he believes there is no evidence of improper contact, taking pains to shift the focus of the investigation toward ferreting out who leaked information about such contacts to the media - saying that the leaks are the only "major crimes" that occurred. But Trump complicated Republicans' efforts with his insistence that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower - an assertion GOP leaders could not, and did not try, to defend. In recent days, some influential Republicans have even called on Trump to apologize to former president Barack Obama. Democrats have yet to find a smoking gun firmly establishing that the president, or his top surrogates, colluded with Russian authorities to swing the election in Trump's favor. That is a tall order, based on the conversations thus far disclosed: Flynn and Sessions bowed out of their roles because they had misled the vice president and lawmakers, respectively, not because they admitted to discussing anything improper with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Expect Democrats to focus on links not just between people who served in Trump's administration and Russian authorities, but also between top campaign surrogates such as former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Carter Page, who have had financial and business ties to Russians and their allies. 2. Will Comey admit to an investigation? News outlets have reported that the FBI and the Justice Department are conducting probes into the allegations surrounding Russia, the 2016 elections and the Trump team. But Comey has yet to admit to this publicly on Capitol Hill. His silence - predicated on his insistence that he never comments on ongoing investigations - has irked members of both parties and invited bipartisan charges that Comey is stonewalling Congress. Democrats allege that perhaps Comey is biased: They say he was perfectly willing to talk about Hillary Clinton's emails - though Comey says he commented in that case because it was a closed investigation. Others have said the director is simply being uncooperative. Some of that vitriol has lessened in recent days, after Comey arrived on Capitol Hill to brief the Gang of Eight - senior lawmakers who receive Congress's highest-level intelligence briefings - on matters related to Russia. Members also secured a promise from the intelligence community that committee members will be privy to the same information provided to the Gang of Eight, a concession lawmakers say is necessary for them to conduct their investigation. Still, many members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have been clamoring for Comey to publicly state that the investigation exists and is ongoing - and members of the House Intelligence Committee are likely to use Monday's forum to challenge him to answer that question. 3. Is it just about wiretapping - or could there be other surveillance involved? We now know that the Justice Department had no information to back up Trump's claim that the Obama administration was tapping his phones in Trump Tower. Comey had been pushing the Justice Department to come clean about that for awhile. What we still do not know, though, is whether there were wiretaps of Trump's affiliates outside the tower - or, in the course of other investigations, whether the intelligence community picked up on communications the president or his team had with Russia during the campaign or the transition period. This sort of "incidental collection" has already helped to take down one member of Trump's team - Flynn, caught on tape speaking with Kislyak, whose communications were being watched. Nunes has suggested there could be others popping up in such indirect surveillance - possibly even the president himself. The House Intelligence Committee is still waiting on answers to a request for a complete list of names of people who have been "unmasked" during surveillance operations. Committee leaders announced Friday that the NSA "partially" responded to their request for that list. But the FBI and CIA have not. A complete list is not likely to make it to lawmakers' hands before Monday morning, so expect a few questions on this subject. And remember: Though Nunes has laid to rest speculation the government bugged the phones of Trump Tower, he has not yet commented on whether there were wiretaps of others connected to Trump, outside the tower. The committee's request covered a very wide range of individuals - including Trump's business associates, his relatives and his friends. Look for members to grill Comey and Rogers for a fuller reckoning. 4. Will Republicans cross the White House? An investigation that began as a probe focused on allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections has expanded - and not just to include whether Russian authorities had direct contacts with campaign officials. The investigation now encompasses going after leakers in the administration for publicizing the information linking Trump surrogates to Kremlin officials. It also includes the query about incidental collection, to see whether the intelligence community adhered closely to the law as it was doing its job. In this highly charged atmosphere, where members choose to direct their questions for Comey and Rogers could reveal a great deal about where they stand. Democrats will undoubtedly focus on the potential connections between the Trump team and Russia. But watch Republicans: Those who pursue similar questions will be knowingly and openly crossing the White House. It is far safer for Republicans to focus on questions about leaks, which are what the Trump team - and Nunes - say are the real crime. Still, the GOP is not united around Trump here. As Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said a month ago: "All of us know that leaks happen in this town, and we all don't like it - but the fact is that you now have a much larger issue to address." 5. Where do we go from here? The pomp and circumstance surrounding this hearing is considerable - and understandable, given the investigation, the politics surrounding it and the guest list. But how much new information will we really learn? The answer may be not much at all. Comey has been very careful about what he says publicly and privately on this matter. More than once, he has come to the Hill for closed-door briefings and members have emerged frustrated - in a public hearing, the FBI director is even less likely to cut loose. Rogers is a bit chattier - but also not likely to divulge state secrets or say anything revealing how the investigation is being conducted, for fear of unmasking sources, methods and classified procedures central to the investigation. It is unlikely that lawmakers will succeed in getting something shocking, or damning, or even conclusive out of the duo. But as we have seen, the investigation can turn dramatically on unsubstantiated tweets from the president, and anything could happen.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has withdrawn retired senior diplomat Anne Patterson as his choice for undersecretary for policy after the White House indicated unwillingness to fight what it said would be a battle for Senate confirmation. U.S. officials said that two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, were strongly opposed to Patterson's nomination because she served as U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 2011 to 2013, a time when the Obama administration supported an elected government with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood that was ultimately overthrown by the Egyptian military. The withdrawal leaves Mattis with a still-empty bench of Trump-appointed senior officials, a situation that stretches across the administration as Cabinet secretaries have not chosen, or the White House has not approved, nominees. Although Obama administration holdovers remain in a few jobs, after eight weeks in office, President Donald Trump has not nominated a single high official under Cabinet rank in the Defense or State departments. The White House plans this week - perhaps as early as Tuesday - to announce a handful of approved nominees proposed by Mattis for senior Defense Department positions, but Patterson will not be among them, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal decision-making. Mattis' acquiescence to her withdrawal came after he fought and won a major battle with the White House to remove Iraq from the list of Muslim-majority countries whose citizens are barred from U.S. entry under Trump's executive order on immigration. Although he reportedly insisted he be able to select his own team when he accepted Trump's offer to head the department, Mattis has skirmished repeatedly with the White House over appointments. His initial choice for deputy secretary, Michele Flournoy, withdrew from consideration after meetings with White House officials. Flournoy served as the department's undersecretary under former president Barack Obama. The current defense deputy, Robert Work, is an Obama holdover who has agreed to remain in office until his successor is in place. The deputy slot remains vacant at the State Department, where Secretary Rex Tillerson's reported choice, Elliott Abrams, was rejected by the White House because of comments he made during the campaign that were perceived to oppose Trump. Patterson retired from the State Department in December as assistant secretary for Near East affairs, the top official on the Middle East, with the highest rank of career diplomat. She also served as ambassador to Pakistan, Colombia and El Salvador. But it was primarily her service in Egypt, as the public face of Obama's support for the Muslim Brotherhood-backed government of then-President Mohamed Morsi, that led to her rejection by the White House, officials said. Morsi was ousted by the Egyptian military in 2013, leading to strained relations between the Obama administration and Egypt under the installed president, Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. Although Patterson was said to be supported by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and was seen as likely to have garnered a majority of votes from both Republicans and Democrats, the Trump administration has voiced strong support for Sissi as a strong counterterrorism ally and largely dismissed criticism of his repression of human and civil rights. While the administration has denounced the Muslim Brotherhood, its plans to issue an executive order designating it as a terrorist organization appear to have fallen at least temporarily by the wayside as a number of Middle East experts and U.S. allies in the region have warned against it. A Sunni Islam organization founded in Egypt early last century, the Brotherhood is now a widespread, loosely organized religious and social movement across the Arab world. While current governments in some countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, consider its adherents terrorists, its chapters operate openly, in some cases holding elected office, in countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan. The Brotherhood has been a longtime target of the far right. Cruz recently reintroduced legislation calling on the State Department to consider a terrorist designation and saying that the Brotherhood espouses "a violent Islamist ideology with a mission of destroying the West." Cotton, who has compared the Brotherhood to the Islamic State and al-Qaida, has said that it opposes Western civilization and "wants to launch terrorist attacks against us." A number of Muslim groups, however, have said the real target of the proposed legislation is to allow the U.S. government to target American Muslims. Cotton's office did not respond and the Defense Department declined to comment on the withdrawal of Patterson. A White House spokesman said, "Typically, we do not comment on personnel matters."

It was the Republican talking point of the Sunday talk shows: If Democrats delay Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court this week, Republicans said, it would be an affront to history — the first time a nominee to the high court had been filibustered. True? Only in a narrow sense. Partisanship has denied a Supreme Court seat to a number of nominees, most recently former President Barack Obama's choice for the court last year. Republicans are advancing their argument about historical precedent to try to soften the ground for a possible change in Senate rules to place Gorsuch on the court. If Republicans now in control of the Senate can't get enough Democrats behind them — it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster — they may shift procedures to require only a simple majority of 51 votes. When then-majority Democrats made that switch for lower-level nominees, Republicans cried foul. Some comments from the Sunday news programs and the larger historical perspective: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "No Supreme Court justice has ever, in the history of our country, been stopped by a partisan filibuster, ever." — "Fox News Sunday" Sen John Cornyn, R-Texas: "This is unprecedented in American history, a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee." — CBS' "Face the Nation." Democrats plan a filibuster against Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. (March 23, 2017) Democrats plan a filibuster against Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. (March 23, 2017) THE FACTS: The senators are ignoring their blockade last year of Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the same seat Gorsuch will occupy if he's confirmed this week. Obama nominated Garland more than a year ago but the Senate's majority Republicans put him on ice, declining to give him a hearing. A filibuster is an unlimited debate that delays a vote, and technically not what stopped Garland. But in effect, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said on Sunday that Garland became the "granddaddy of filibusters." McConnell and Cornyn are correct in this sense: If Democrats were to succeed in blocking Gorsuch, it would be a first for the nomination of a judge to join the court. But one previous high court nomination was killed by a filibuster, in 1968. That's when opponents of Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas stopped him from being elevated to chief justice. The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will likely reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch's... The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will likely reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch's... When McConnell and Cornyn said no one had been stopped by a "partisan filibuster," they surely had that episode in mind. Fortas faced opposition from a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. So his ambitions were thwarted by a bipartisan filibuster. It's only been since 1949 that nominations have been subject to a potential supermajority requirement under Senate rules. In the 19th century, the Senate used procedural votes or took no action at all on 10 high court nominees who were thwarted. Most had been chosen by so-called accidental presidents — men who ascended to the White House after the death of a president and lacked strong support in Congress. Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will likely reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch's nomination to replace Antonin Scalia, with whom he shares an "originalist" philosophy of constitutional interpretation, is unlikely to tip the ideological balance of the Supreme Court. And Gorsuch's three days of confirmation hearings last month never captured the national attention afforded to previous nominees. But with the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled to refer him to the full Senate on Monday, lawmakers are about to embark on the final - and perhaps most bitter - round of debate. Three days of formal debate begin Tuesday with Republicans planning to confirm Gorsuch by Friday. That timeline would give the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge a chance to join the high court in late April and to participate in the final cases of this year's term, which ends in June. The Republican-controlled Senate is likely to confirm him, but only if it changes the chamber's rules. Democrats are vowing to filibuster Gorsuch, a tactical roadblock that can only be overcome with the votes of 60 senators. Republicans hold 52 seats, and only three moderate Democrats so far say they plan to vote for Gorsuch. On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said that it is "highly, highly unlikely" that Republicans will get the 60 votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster. Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Schumer added that it "is up to Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority" to set the rules and tenor for the confirmation vote. Senate Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee swelled Friday as Democrats neared the numbers needed for a filibuster, setting up a showdown with Republicans who have the votes to confirm Neil Gorsuch. Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut... Senate Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee swelled Friday as Democrats neared the numbers needed for a filibuster, setting up a showdown with Republicans who have the votes to confirm Neil Gorsuch. Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut... But McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate majority leader, disagreed, telling "Fox News Sunday" that Gorsuch will "ultimately be confirmed. Exactly how that happens ... will be up to our Democratic colleagues." If Democrats successfully filibuster Gorsuch, McConnell and his caucus are likely to agree to change the chamber's rules and end filibusters on Supreme Court picks. That would extend a rule change made by Democrats in 2013 that punished Republicans for years of attempts to block President Barack Obama's nominees by ending filibusters for all executive branch appointments and lower-court picks. Last year, Republicans refused to hold hearings or votes for Judge Merrick Garland, Obama's choice to replace Scalia, arguing that the next president should get to pick the replacement. The move infuriated Democrats - and has been a major factor in generating such unified opposition to Gorsuch. Martin B. Gold, a former floor adviser and counsel to Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, R-Tenn., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who has written a book on Senate floor procedure, warned that this week's expected change in Senate rules is likely to put even more importance on the partisan control of the Senate. One of Senate’s most serious jobs – confirming the president’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court – has devolved into a game of political chicken. Senators are heading toward an institution-defining showdown next week as Democrats promise to try to block President Trump’s nominee,... One of Senate’s most serious jobs – confirming the president’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court – has devolved into a game of political chicken. Senators are heading toward an institution-defining showdown next week as Democrats promise to try to block President Trump’s nominee,... "Between the Democrats taking offense at what the Republicans did on Garland and Republicans taking offense to what Democrats are doing to Gorsuch, you wonder who's going to put the weapons down, or if they'll always stay drawn," Gold said. "And if the partisan makeup flips, you wonder if a president will ever get anyone confirmed." In interviews before Gorsuch's confirmation hearings last month, several Republican senators agreed that Gorsuch was a safe conservative choice who would maintain the balance of the court and make future fights to fill vacancies even more critical. "I have no doubt that from the Democrats' perspective, the next vacancy will be Armageddon. They will fire every attack they can marshal at whoever the nominee is," said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., agreed, saying that the next confirmation fight will be "a blood bath." Cruz and Flake's predictions assume that the next Supreme Court vacancy will be caused by the departure of aging liberal justices, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Steven Breyer or by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's most frequent swing vote. The Gorsuch battle has not generated as much interest or concern among liberal organizations as among conservative groups. Conservative groups have spent nearly $10 million on a television ad campaign designed to pressure moderate Democrats. Adam Jentleson, senior strategic adviser to the liberal Center for American Progress, said that progressives may not have felt as compelled to fight the Gorsuch nomination this year. But next time, he said, "We should prepare by being ready to wage the battle of ideas as aggressively as possible." The partisan dynamic could be "flipped in the future - and that's the key thing," he said. "There's probably not much more that would be more motivating (to Democrats) than the terrifying prospect of Trump appointing an extreme conservative to the court to tip the balance for a lifetime. So, I think that with conservatives there's a false sense of security that that's something that plays to their advantage. I don't think that will end up being true." Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the pro-Gorsuch Judicial Crisis Network, which is bankrolling the multimillion dollar ad campaign, said Schumer and Democrats are promoting a "historic level of gridlock." She said her conservative organization has been opposed to judicial filibusters in both Republican and Democratic administrations and that only Democrats have ever used threats of a filibuster against Republican nominees. JCN's ad campaign appeared to help convince two moderate Democratic senators, Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Manchin III, D-W. Va., last week to say that they will support Gorsuch. On Sunday, Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., became the third Democrat to announce support for Gorsuch. He has been among 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Trump carried in the November election who have been targeted by a multimillion dollar ad campaign backing Gorsuch. The decisions by Heitkamp and Manchin earned swift rebukes from liberal organizations. NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group that helps mobilize Democratic voters, warned that they would not endorse any Democrat who supports Gorsuch. On Sunday, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal political group that campaigns for Democratic candidates, ran full-page ads in North Dakota and West Virginia newspapers criticizing the senators' choice. That pressure may have been a factor for Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who has also been targeted by JCN but said on Friday she will vote against Gorsuch. In an essay to constituents, she said it had been "a really difficult decision for me." Another potential "yes" vote, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said on Sunday that he won't announced his decision until Tuesday or Wednesday, but suggested that he's leaning against Gorsuch. Filibustering a Supreme Court nominee "doesn't strike me as out of line with Senate tradition," King told CBS' "Face the Nation," noting that during his 4 1/2 years in office he's had to cast votes to end filibusters 400 times "on all matter of big and small things." The Washington Post's Robert Barnes contributed to this report.

One of Senate’s most serious jobs – confirming the president’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court – has devolved into a game of political chicken. Senators are heading toward an institution-defining showdown next week as Democrats promise to try to block President Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, with a filibuster, a rarely seen maneuver for high court appointments. Republicans are threatening to respond by changing long-standing Senate rules to circumvent the 60 votes that would be needed to overcome a filibuster. Instead they would allow confirmation with a simple majority. Sens. Roger E. Wicker, R-Miss., and Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., are not usually partisan firebrands, particularly on presidential appointments. Back in 2013, Wicker helped temporarily defuse a showdown over Republican filibusters of President Barack Obama's nominees to the judiciary and agencies.... Sens. Roger E. Wicker, R-Miss., and Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., are not usually partisan firebrands, particularly on presidential appointments. Back in 2013, Wicker helped temporarily defuse a showdown over Republican filibusters of President Barack Obama's nominees to the judiciary and agencies.... The outcome has the potential to not only shape the future of the Supreme Court — which has been without a full bench since the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year — it also could crush one final vestige of bipartisanship in the Senate, altering the upper chamber for years to come. “It churns our stomach,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) as senators weighed their options this week. Pressed if they were really ready to invoke the so-called “nuclear option” to ensure Gorsuch is confirmed, many Republican senators this week demurred. “Can I answer you that in a couple days?” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). But others – notably seasoned institutionalists, including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the senior-most Senate Republican — appear ready to overhaul the rules for Trump. “Judge Gorsuch is going to be confirmed. By any means necessary,” Hatch said in a statement. The battle over the Supreme Court seat was always expected to be a partisan affair in today’s heated political climate. But the polemics intensified after the Republican majority denied President Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing ahead of last year’s presidential election. Now the Gorsuch nomination is being viewed as a must-win for Republicans, as Trump’s first 100 days have faltered. For Democrats it has become a proxy for a broader opposition to Trump’s administration and the Republican agenda. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is trying to hold the Democratic minority together to deny Republicans the 60 votes needed to advance Gorsuch past a filibuster. Republicans, with their 52-seat majority, must peel off eight Democrats to overcome the filibuster. If they are unable to so, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to do as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) did in 2013, when he used the Democratic majority to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority vote for other types of judicial nominations. Reid said the move was needed to overcome Republican filibusters. “Once they let the genie out, it’s not going back,” said Rounds. “It never should have been done, but now that is the precedent in the United States Senate.” Neither McConnell nor Schumer will say, exactly, how many senators they have on their side. Each suggests the other is bluffing. McConnell has repeatedly promised that Gorsuch will be confirmed April 7, before the two-week spring recess. “I’m confident he’ll be confirmed,” he said. Schumer was equally certain. “It's going to be a real uphill climb for him to get those 60 votes,” he said. The test vote is expected next week. Republicans went into the court fight thinking their task would be easy enough. Gorsuch, the affable Colorado appellate judge, was viewed as a conservative who might be able to attract some Democratic votes. Republicans also expected the politics would be on their side. Democrats from the red states that Trump won, particularly those up for reelection in 2018, they reasoned, would be more interested in bucking their party than crossing the new president. But since Trump nominated Gorsuch, the dynamics have dramatically shifted. Trump’s approval rating continues to nosedive amid the FBI probe into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia, and his own missteps over the botched travel ban and failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. At the same time, Democrats quickly shifted from being chastened by their November electoral loss to emboldened – even pressured -- by the sudden outpouring of liberal resistance to Trump’s presidency, particularly street protests that erupted in the weeks after the inauguration. “The base really cares about this, and I think people understand that going along with someone as extreme as Neil Gorsuch is not just bad for the country, it’s bad politics,” said Drew Courtney, spokesman at the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way. “This is the first opportunity for senators to show they will stand and fight. Nothing will do more to dampen enthusiasm than for Democrats to fold on this.” Some of the more centrist Democrats in the Senate, including Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), have kept their options open. The risk for Democrats, of course, is that not only might they lose the confirmation battle, but their filibuster could trigger a chain of events that changes the operations of the Senate in perhaps irreparable ways. Experts say moving away from a 60-vote threshold to overcome filibusters of Supreme Court picks would make it easier for presidents in the future to select more ideologically extreme justices. Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees act out a peculiar Washington ritual in which inquisitive senators gather before TV cameras to hear an aspiring justice politely refuse to answer their questions on all the pressing legal issues of the day. To no one’s surprise, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch... Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees act out a peculiar Washington ritual in which inquisitive senators gather before TV cameras to hear an aspiring justice politely refuse to answer their questions on all the pressing legal issues of the day. To no one’s surprise, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch... It may also open the door in the Senate for passage of legislation by simple majority. It currently typically takes 60 votes. The use of filibusters for legislation encourages a dose of bipartisanship since rarely does one party count that many senators. More than a decade ago, a group of senators, the so-called “Gang of 14,” negotiated a compromise when there was a previous attempt to invoke the nuclear option over filibusters of lower-court nominees. But no such effort appears to be underway this time. Of the three senators still remaining from the gang, Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), none seems poised to stop it this time. Ads are pouring on both sides, from liberal groups as well as special interests, including the National Rifle Assn.’s political arm. The conservative Judicial Crisis Network has run more than $4 million in ads, and has been criticized for not disclosing its donors, which it is not legally required to do. As tensions rise ahead of the vote, the group’s chief counsel, Carrie Severino, expects McConnell is not bluffing. “Democrats have been attempting to just throw sand in the gears,” she said. “Leader McConnell doesn’t want to participate in their gridlock.” lisa.mascaro@latimes.com @LisaMascaro

It was the Republican talking point of the Sunday talk shows: If Democrats delay Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court this week, Republicans said, it would be an affront to history — the first time a nominee to the high court had been filibustered. True? Only in a narrow sense. Partisanship has denied a Supreme Court seat to a number of nominees, most recently former President Barack Obama's choice for the court last year. Republicans are advancing their argument about historical precedent to try to soften the ground for a possible change in Senate rules to place Gorsuch on the court. If Republicans now in control of the Senate can't get enough Democrats behind them — it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster — they may shift procedures to require only a simple majority of 51 votes. When then-majority Democrats made that switch for lower-level nominees, Republicans cried foul. Some comments from the Sunday news programs and the larger historical perspective: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "No Supreme Court justice has ever, in the history of our country, been stopped by a partisan filibuster, ever." — "Fox News Sunday" Sen John Cornyn, R-Texas: "This is unprecedented in American history, a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee." — CBS' "Face the Nation." Democrats plan a filibuster against Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. (March 23, 2017) Democrats plan a filibuster against Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. (March 23, 2017) THE FACTS: The senators are ignoring their blockade last year of Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the same seat Gorsuch will occupy if he's confirmed this week. Obama nominated Garland more than a year ago but the Senate's majority Republicans put him on ice, declining to give him a hearing. A filibuster is an unlimited debate that delays a vote, and technically not what stopped Garland. But in effect, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said on Sunday that Garland became the "granddaddy of filibusters." McConnell and Cornyn are correct in this sense: If Democrats were to succeed in blocking Gorsuch, it would be a first for the nomination of a judge to join the court. But one previous high court nomination was killed by a filibuster, in 1968. That's when opponents of Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas stopped him from being elevated to chief justice. The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will likely reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch's... The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will likely reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch's... When McConnell and Cornyn said no one had been stopped by a "partisan filibuster," they surely had that episode in mind. Fortas faced opposition from a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. So his ambitions were thwarted by a bipartisan filibuster. It's only been since 1949 that nominations have been subject to a potential supermajority requirement under Senate rules. In the 19th century, the Senate used procedural votes or took no action at all on 10 high court nominees who were thwarted. Most had been chosen by so-called accidental presidents — men who ascended to the White House after the death of a president and lacked strong support in Congress.

Sens. Roger E. Wicker, R-Miss., and Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., are not usually partisan firebrands, particularly on presidential appointments. Back in 2013, Wicker helped temporarily defuse a showdown over Republican filibusters of President Barack Obama's nominees to the judiciary and agencies. More than a decade ago, Carper voted to confirm President George W. Bush's first Supreme Court nominee and opposed Democratic efforts to filibuster the other. Now, with about 10 days left in the showdown over President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, both Wicker and Carper have turned dour in their outlook for what the battle means for the Senate - and the country. Wicker is all but certain that Democrats have enough votes to block Gorsuch's confirmation next week with a filibuster - by demanding a procedural step that takes 60 votes to clear. That, in turn, probably would prompt the Republicans to change the rules unilaterally to allow Gorsuch's confirmation, and all other Supreme Court picks thereafter, by a simple majority. "I think it's a done deal," Wicker said Tuesday. "That's the way it's headed." Carper agreed, explaining that he would rather see Republicans eliminate supermajority thresholds for Supreme Court nominees, further poisoning the already toxic atmosphere in Washington, than do anything to support Gorsuch. The purpose of the rule is to promote bipartisanship and consensus, which in turn creates legitimacy and buy-in for policy and governance. If the filibuster goes away, so does yet another layer of collegiality in Congress - and another way to shore up Washington's credibility. A showdown over President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee and Senate rules loomed as the number of Democrats opposing Judge Neil Gorsuch grew to two dozen on Tuesday. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, was joined by five other senators who announced their intention to... A showdown over President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee and Senate rules loomed as the number of Democrats opposing Judge Neil Gorsuch grew to two dozen on Tuesday. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, was joined by five other senators who announced their intention to... It would be the second time in 3 1/2 years that the Senate majority has breached the long-held standard of first clearing a two-thirds majority vote to alter the chamber's rules. The first time Democrats, then led by Harry M. Reid (Nev.), ended 60-vote filibusters for all nominees except those for the Supreme Court. If they all contribute to taking the next step, both parties will have completed their hypocritical march to the opposite side of this issue over the past decade. Democrats, after years of demanding speedy passage of Obama's nominees, now clamor for scrutiny and supermajorities. Republicans have quickly adopted the old Democratic talking points. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who at times has played the role of custodian of his chamber's rich history, will have made the same move that led to what he called in 2013 "a sad day in the history of the Senate." And once both sides are guilty of breaching that standard on nominations, it would seem to be only a matter of time before a future majority obliterates filibusters on other legislation. Gorsuch could fall between Justice Scalia and centrist Justice Kennedy Gorsuch could fall between Justice Scalia and centrist Justice Kennedy Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.), one of the first Democrats to declare his support for a filibuster of Gorsuch, said that the likelihood that the judge will not win 60 votes proves that he is outside the mainstream. "If you're a consensus pick, you should be able to get 60 votes," Casey said. In reality, Gorsuch's hearings last week unfolded without any new revelations and followed the playbook of hearings for the four justices confirmed this century. The majority asked soft questions to bolster his case, and the minority asked tough questions and demanded, unsuccessfully, that he predetermine how he would rule on hot-button issues. In another time, Gorsuch easily might have been considered the consensus candidate that Casey described. As a result, there is a sense of raw politics in Democrats' growing opposition to Gorsuch, because liberal anti-Trump activists are pushing Democrats to oppose every Trump move. With most centrist voters not paying attention to procedural fights over confirmations, some Democrats think the bigger political penalty would be to disappoint their base by allowing an easy confirmation this time. Republicans misjudged Casey, hoping he would come around to supporting Gorsuch because of his congeniality - and because Trump won his state. The Democrat cited Gorsuch's rulings against federal agencies in their regulatory decisions. And Carper said he cannot forgive Republicans for never even holding a hearing on the first nominee for the current court vacancy - Judge Merrick Garland, whom Obama nominated after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. "I have a very hard time getting over what was done to Merrick Garland, a very hard time," Carper said Tuesday. "That's a wrong that should be righted, we have a chance to do that, and it won't be by confirming Judge Gorsuch the first time through." Interviews with Wicker, Carper and half a dozen other senators who could anchor something called the "Reasonable Caucus" delivered few signs of compromise ahead. If those assessments are right, by the end of next week Republicans will have triggered the "nuclear option," as the potential rule change is known by insiders. No concrete attempts have been made to convene the bipartisan huddles that have sometimes worked in previous fights over the state of the Senate. "Not that I've seen," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the co-leader of the bipartisan Gang of 14 that averted a similar showdown in 2005. McCain said that the environment is too polarized now and that the old personalities - powerful chairmen, often war heroes, willing to buck their leadership - have been replaced by a less social, more timid crop of senators. "We just have a different environment around here," he said. "People don't sit down and talk the way they used to." Asked whether he considered that depressing, McCain went on: "It is, it really is." McCain is one of just three left from the 2005 gang, and the other two, Sens. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both adopted a hard-line tone toward Democrats on the matter of Gorsuch, whom they consider highly qualified. Collins, the leading moderate Republican, had supported holding a vote on Garland. But now she thinks Democrats need to move on because Trump won the election. "That is in the past, and it is not fair to Judge Gorsuch to deny him a straight up-or-down vote based on what happened with Merrick Garland," she said Tuesday. Collins doesn't see a bipartisan pact coming together and said lawmakers should fight over the next vacancy on the court: "I think it would be wise of the Democrats to vote for him and live to fight another day." Some Democrats have suggested privately that they first must demonstrate that they have the votes to block Gorsuch and then commence negotiations to avoid the nuclear showdown. But even moderate Democrats such as Carper are not showing much willingness to support a deal that would put Gorsuch on the court in exchange for the possibility of filibustering the next nominee. "Not much of a prize," he said. That would set the filibuster in motion. And almost like Cold War generals mapping out war games, Republicans say they would be compelled to respond in kind. Otherwise Democrats would have set a new precedent for blocking a Supreme Court nominee. "We can't let that happen," Wicker said.

The Senate Intelligence Committee's inquiry into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election will be “one of the biggest investigations” in years and has already involved an “unprecedented” level of cooperation between Congress and U.S. spy agencies, the panel's chairman said Wednesday. At a Capitol Hill news conference, the committee chairman, Sen. Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, and its ranking Democrat, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, emphasized the bipartisan nature of the panel's efforts, drawing a determined, though unstated, contrast with the partisan dysfunction of a parallel investigation in the House. The two insisted the Senate committee would carry out a full, unfettered investigation of Russian efforts to influence the presidential election and any potential ties to Donald Trump’s campaign. The committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on Thursday, its first in the current investigation. “The committee will go wherever the intelligence leads us,” Burr said. Burr pointedly refused to endorse White House statements that investigators eventually would find that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russians. “It would be crazy to try to draw any conclusions” at this point, Burr said. “We know that our challenge is to answer that question to the American people,” he added, referring to the issue of Trump's involvement. Warner praised Burr and said Americans should “not lose sight of what the investigation is about: An outside foreign adversary effectively sought to hijack our most critical democratic process, the election for president,” and “favor one candidate over another.” The House Intelligence Committee's probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential ties between the Trump team and the Kremlin, is effectively on hold, after its chairman said the panel would not interview more witnesses until two spy chiefs return to Capitol Hill for... The House Intelligence Committee's probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential ties between the Trump team and the Kremlin, is effectively on hold, after its chairman said the panel would not interview more witnesses until two spy chiefs return to Capitol Hill for... “They didn't do it because it was in the best interest of the American people,” Warner said. Russian President “Vladimir Putin's goal is a weaker United States.” The Russian action “should be a concern to all Americans regardless of party affiliation,” he added. The investigation on the House side has been stalled since the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), canceled a hearing that had been planned for Tuesday at which former Deputy Atty. Gen. Sally Yates was scheduled to testify. In late January, Yates had blown the whistle on retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was Trump’s national security advisor at the time. Yates told White House officials that Flynn had misled his colleagues, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, officials said. Trump fired Flynn a few weeks later when news reports disclosed the nature of his meetings with Kislyak. Yates’ allies said she had planned to give the committee additional details related to Flynn. The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying in the House investigation of possible links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign, according to letters provided to The Washington Post. The effort to keep Yates from testifying... The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying in the House investigation of possible links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign, according to letters provided to The Washington Post. The effort to keep Yates from testifying... Nunes’ decision to cancel the hearing came after a lawyer for Yates said in letters to the Justice Department that the Trump administration had tried to place “constraints” on her testimony by asserting her actions as deputy attorney general were “client confidences” that could not be disclosed without written approval. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the White House did not interfere with Yates’ plans to testify and wanted her to speak publicly. Earlier, Nunes had generated controversy by going to the White House for a secret briefing by a person who, he said, showed him intelligence reports that talked about Trump transition officials. It remains unclear whether those reports provide evidence that transition officials themselves were subject to surveillance or were simply talked about by other people who were surveilled. It’s also unclear whether their identities were mishandled. On Wednesday, Spicer continued to decline to provide information about who Nunes met with. The congressman said he met his source at the White House to look at classified material. White House officials control access to the secure intelligence facility there. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the panel, called for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after his White House meetings were revealed. On Wednesday, Schiff called for Yates to be allowed to testify, along with former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper. “Sally Yates is willing to testify,” the White House “says they want her to testify, public wants to hear from her,” he said in a tweet. “What's the holdup?” Schiff and Nunes are scheduled to meet Thursday — their first conversation since the controversy broke out. On the Senate side, Warner said he wanted the committee to question Yates, Brennan and Clapper, but only once the members and staff had done enough investigative work to know what questions to ask. He said he had “confidence in Richard Burr” to run a fair investigation and produce a bipartisan conclusion. In addition to the House and Senate inquiries, the FBI is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian authorities during the campaign, FBI Director James B. Comey said this month. Both senators also warned that Russia was attempting to influence elections this year in France and Germany. “I think it's safe by everybody's judgment that the Russians are actively involved in the French elections,” the first round of which is next month, Burr said. A Jan. 6 report by U.S. intelligence agencies found that senior Russian officials, including Putin, wanted to undermine the U.S. democratic process, hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and help Trump's campaign. Senate investigators are reviewing the raw intelligence that went into that report, Burr said. But the Senate investigation will look at other evidence as well, noting that since the report was written the U.S. has learned more about Russia’s attempt to influence the election. “What we know today is a lot more than what they knew in December when they went through this process,” he said. The Senate committee staff already has reviewed thousands of pages of intelligence documents and has begun scheduling interviews with a list of 20 preliminary witnesses, who will be questioned in private before the panel holds public hearings, Burr said. He strongly implied that one of the potential witnesses was Flynn. “You would think less of us” if the committee had not talked with Flynn, Burr told reporters. The witnesses, including Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and advisor, will be questioned when the committee is ready, he said. “Any investigation of this kind will start with private interviews to determine the value of what a witness has to provide for the committee,” Burr said. david.cloud@latimes.com Twitter: @davidcloudLAT

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said schools would remain open for the full academic year on Friday just hours after a judge tossed a lawsuit Chicago Public Schools had framed as a last resort to secure enough money to keep classes in session. "The kids of the City of Chicago will be in school until the end of the school year," Emanuel said at a late afternoon news conference at City Hall. "That is where they belong." Emanuel and CPS officials said they haven't figured out how to find the money to operate schools through June 20. The mayor did not directly respond when asked why he failed to reassure parents months earlier that school would not close early. Instead, he again sought to blame Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and ended the news conference. "The stress on the system comes from the governor," Emanuel said. CPS officials promised to find a way to keep schools open and meet financial obligations that include a massive payment to the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund due June 30. "We're going to find a way to fund this," Chicago Board of Education President Frank Clark said. "This is not the end of this journey. This is not the end of our legal options, and we will look at every financial option that's really open to us." The mayor's announcement followed a Cook County judge's ruling to dismiss a CPS lawsuit against the state over education funding, and also reject the district's request for an injunction that would freeze state funding to public schools throughout Illinois. With the school year coming to a close, Chicago Public School is short at least $130 million. Here is how it happened. With the school year coming to a close, Chicago Public School is short at least $130 million. Here is how it happened. Judge Franklin Ulyses Valderrama said that CPS could file an amended complaint by May 26. City and CPS officials were quick to praise sections of Valderrama's 44-page ruling that carefully summarized the complexities of the case. "The Court is not oblivious to the fiscal challenges confronting CPS," Valderrama wrote. "To say that the State's current scheme of funding public education is broken is to state the obvious. Plaintiffs' Complaint, however, as constituted is not the vehicle to redress this inequity." Valderrama also wrote that the state's argument that CPS could simply borrow more money to solve its problems was "eerily reminiscent" of the "let them eat cake" comment often attributed to the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, in response to the plight of her people. One CPS official said that city and school authorities were debating whether to press ahead with the case. Valderrama's ruling represents a serious blow to CPS in its efforts to pressure the state to give it more money. District CEO Forrest Claypool persistently had warned the school year could end as early as June 1 without additional state funding. Attorneys for the state of Illinois asked a judge Friday to dismiss an education funding lawsuit brought by Chicago Public Schools as part of the district's efforts to plug a gaping budget hole. The state argued that CPS' complaints about pension funding and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto... Attorneys for the state of Illinois asked a judge Friday to dismiss an education funding lawsuit brought by Chicago Public Schools as part of the district's efforts to plug a gaping budget hole. The state argued that CPS' complaints about pension funding and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto... In putting an end to that threat, Emanuel sought to again blame Rauner for vetoing a bill that would have provided $215 million in additional state pension funding. "The kids of the city of Chicago will be in school 'til the end of the school year," Emanuel said. "That is where they belong. The governor and the General Assembly belong in Springfield…creating for the first time ever equitable funding for children across the state of Illinois." Emanuel did not mention other factors behind CPS' budget woes: The district skipped years of payments into the teacher pension system, and now the district must make larger payments to try to make up a massive shortfall. CPS has also used some of its state aid dollars to finance a mountain of expensive debt. And the mayor did not note that the extra money for CPS was contingent on a deal being struck on statewide pension reform. Emanuel did not offer specifics on where he'd find the money to keep schools open, saying that the idea of loaning CPS money from the city's special taxing district funds was just one possibility among many. "We're going to look at all options, and look at every avenue. That's an idea," the mayor said. "There are other ideas on the table. I'll tell you what's not on the table. That's missing a single day of school. That's not an option. That's off the table." Chicago Public Schools upped the stakes of its legal challenge to state education funding on Monday, warning that the school year could end nearly three weeks early and summer school programs could be cut if the district doesn't get a quick and favorable ruling. "These possibilities are deeply...

"These possibilities are deeply... Aldermen were initially told briefings would be held this week to discuss options, but those sessions have been put off to next week, said Ald. George Cardenas, 12th. Cardenas also talked about the idea of the city loaning money to CPS from tax increment finance district funds. "The administration feels that — let's wait until the Springfield chaos sort of gets resolved, and in the meantime something can be worked out in the short term," he said. "And obviously, the intent is to keep schools open, and so you have to look at what options you have, and that's one of the options." One budget Band-Aid under discussion would involve delaying payments to CPS vendors, CPS sources said. Some vendors may have to wait to see paychecks from the district anyway, one official said, because the state still owes CPS more than $400 million in grants that finance certain programs but are also used by the district for operating expenses. Claypool said Emanuel "has committed to us that he will use the powers of his office in the coming days and the coming weeks to help us find a way." "I wish I could stand here today and tell you how we will do that, but I am confident the mayor's success, given his position and his history, that we will find that way," Claypool said. The district's lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the state discriminates against its largely impoverished and minority students, and violates Illinois civil rights law, by contributing more money to teacher pensions in the suburbs and downstate than Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at a news conference at City Hall in Chicago on April 28, 2017. Emanuel said Chicago Public Schools won't end classes early this year.

Valderrama concluded that the district's request to halt the state from distributing funds to any public school or public school teacher pension fund did not fulfill the "fundamental purpose" of a preliminary injunction. The judge said such a request "would do nothing to prevent the harms Plaintiffs allege and, in fact, would exacerbate those harms by depriving CPS of all sources of State funding." Valderrama wrote that the school district failed to tie its discrimination claims to any state "program or activity" as required by the Illinois Civil Rights Act. "While the Complaint alleges 'discriminatory practices,' the Complaint fails to identify the alleged 'discriminatory practices' and fails to link their allegation to criteria or methods of administration," Valderrama wrote. In a statement, Gov. Bruce Rauner's office applauded the judge's decision. "With this distraction behind us, we can move forward on working with the General Assembly to fix our state's school funding formula," the statement said. jjperez@tribpub.com Twitter @PerezJr hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday proposed security standards and other broad outlines for his long-gestating Chicago municipal ID card program for immigrants and others, but the introduced ordinance leaves several unanswered questions about how it will work. The measure the mayor brought before the City Council is aimed at assuaging the fears of those living in Chicago illegally and their supporters that President Donald Trump's administration could use the information submitted by card applicants to try to track down and deport them. City Clerk Anna Valencia's office would be able to review documents provided by applicants to prove their identities and residency, but officials would not have permission to collect or keep that information, according to the ordinance. And the clerk "shall not maintain a record of an applicant's address or telephone number," it states. The mayor's move came as he continued to strike a tough pose in his defense of immigrants after Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week again threatened to withhold federal money from cities that don't cooperate with federal immigration agents. Emanuel on Wednesday downplayed the move as a response to a crackdown on illegal immigration that Trump's administration has pursued in recent months, instead saying the ID will represent Chicago's values as a welcoming city. "This is a product of work that was started a year and a half or two years ago. I introduced the budget, which included the funding for the work on the municipal ID, in October. We passed it in November," Emanuel said. "That work was about fulfilling my pledge that we are going to be a city that is open and welcoming to immigrants, open and welcoming and most friendly to immigrants." As President Donald Trump promises a crackdown on immigrants living here illegally, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is pressing ahead with a municipal ID plan, a concept that's drawn fire from both sides of the issue. Some immigrant allies worry federal agents could use applicants' personal information from... As President Donald Trump promises a crackdown on immigrants living here illegally, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is pressing ahead with a municipal ID plan, a concept that's drawn fire from both sides of the issue. Some immigrant allies worry federal agents could use applicants' personal information from... The proposal requires all city departments to accept the city card as a valid form of identification, a key point for Emanuel as he seeks to give undocumented immigrants a way to identify themselves while filing police reports, buying city stickers, paying bills or seeking to gain access to public buildings. It remains to be seen whether people who are here illegally feel confident enough that their information is confidential to apply for the cards and then use them at a time when some immigrants reportedly are skittish about even going out to shop in neighborhoods such as Little Village that have large immigrant populations. The ordinance also will allow applicants to self-designate their gender, a significant option for members of the transgender community who have had trouble with other forms of ID that can make it difficult to choose a gender different from the one on their birth certificates. The mayor's proposal lacks many specifics and leaves several components of the program to be designed by Valencia down the road. It does not specify what documents people can use to establish their identities and residency to get a card. Nor does it list places like museums or sports stadiums that might give cardholders discounts, an arrangement Valencia has said she wants to pursue in order to make the cards useful to people other than immigrants and the homeless. It also allows Valencia to charge a fee for the ID, but doesn't specify how much. There is $1 million in the city's 2017 budget to pay for getting the ID program off the ground. Asked about the ID program Wednesday, Valencia did not say what documents the city might consider to verify someone's identification when issuing the cards. She also did not say what training would be put in place to verify the documents presented to her office are legitimate. And Valencia also had no estimate for how much the program might cost, but said her office was working on a request for proposals for technology that would be used to administer the cards "We're looking at an expansive list of documents we could use, whether it's a high school transcript to prove residency or a letter from a nonprofit stating you live there while trying to get back on your feet …" Valencia said. "We're still exploring this." In other City Council action: *18- to 20-year-olds will be allowed to serve liquor in restaurants and ring up liquor sales in grocery stores under a measure aldermen approved, saying it will open up more jobs for young people around the city. *Amplified street musicians and drummers on some downtown streets would be restricted to performing during particular hours under a hoped-for compromise aldermen introduced after musicians' supporters questioned the legality of a proposed outright ban in some areas. *Emanuel introduced a $160 million, four-year contract with a group led by Massachusetts-based energy-efficiency company Ameresco to replace 270,000 high-pressure sodium street lights with LED fixtures that use less energy. The cost, city officials said, would be paid off with an anticipated $10 million in annual electricity savings. *The mayor proposed allowing gun ranges in more areas of Chicago in response to a federal appellate court ruling that struck down the city's zoning restrictions on the shooting facilities.

With the historical site of Abraham Lincoln's "House Divided" speech as a backdrop, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Wednesday criticized Republican rival Donald Trump for divisively exploiting fear in labeling him a "threat" to democracy. Clinton delivered a largely somber speech on respecting racial and ethnic differences amid escalating gun violence in accusing the GOP candidate of turning the Party of Lincoln into the "Party of Trump." Clinton hits Springfield, Trump meet with VP finalists. July 13, 2016. (CBS Miami) Clinton hits Springfield, Trump meet with VP finalists. July 13, 2016. (CBS Miami) While she sought to strike a presidential tone, Clinton also did something of a political pivot. The former secretary of state noted her own involvement as a divisive political character, vowing to "do better." Moments later, in attacking her opponent as "so dangerous," Clinton said the country needs a president who can bring people together, contending Trump is focused on "stoking mistrust and pitting American against American." Clinton also acknowledged the real-world concern of Trump supporters fueled by an economy that has "stripped too many people of their sense of security and dignity." "It's about something deeper … a sense of dislocation, even a pessimism about whether America still holds anything for them or cares about them at all," Clinton said. During previous speeches, Clinton tried to associate Republicans with the controversial Trump. But in Springfield, she attempted to navigate a finer point in making an appeal for unity regardless of political support. "Let's put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump's supporters. We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face, but I believe like anyone else, they're trying to figure out their place in a fast-changing America," Clinton said. "They want to know how to make a good living and how to give their kids better futures and opportunities. That's why we've got to reclaim the promise of America for all our people — no matter who they vote for," she said. Clinton spoke to 150 invited guests at the Old State Capitol, the historic landmark where Lincoln gave his "House Divided" speech in 1858. It's also where President Barack Obama launched his bid for the White House, outside on a frigid day in February 2007. Clinton quoted from Lincoln's famous speech and said the turmoil surrounding police and their interaction with minority communities has made it clear that "America's long struggle with race is far from finished." "The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln's time, not even close, and we should be clear about that," Clinton said. "But recent events across America have left people asking if we are still a house divided." "I believe that our future peace and prosperity depends on whether we meet this moment with honesty and courage," Clinton said. She said that requires "a better job of listening to others," saying the opinions of those affected by police violence are just as important as those from law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line each day. She then called for changes in policing policies, tighter restrictions on access to guns and assault weapons. "Now I understand that just saying these things together may upset some people," Clinton said. "But all these things can be true at the same time." Clinton also called for tough but necessary conversations to heal deep divisions across the nation following last week's fatal shootings of black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana, and the subsequent attack on police by a black Army veteran in Dallas that left five officers dead. The former U.S. senator also mentioned the shooting of black teen Laquan McDonald by white Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke, who was charged with murder in the October 2014 shooting just before the release of video last November. And Clinton mentioned Sandra Bland, a former Naperville woman who died a year ago Wednesday in a Texas jail cell after she was pulled over in a controversial arrest by a state trooper. Clinton said the conversations about race and policing are happening against a bigger economic backdrop that's created a gulf between the wealthy and working class, which has only been exacerbated by partisan divisions that have blocked possible changes. She noted her involvement in that process, before launching into an offensive against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. "His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes," Clinton said. "It's there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as president." Clinton cited Trump's comments against Muslims, Mexicans and women, before recounting an interview he gave to Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday in which the real estate mogul born into wealth said he can relate to the struggles of black Americans because "even against me, the system is rigged." Responded Clinton: "Even this, the killing of people, is somehow all about him." "We need a president who can pull us together, not split us apart," Clinton said to cheers. "This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the Party of Trump. And that's not just a huge loss for our democracy, it is a threat to it." Clinton also raised campaign cash Wednesday in a private Wilmette event hosted by Laura Ricketts, who is part of the family that owns the Cubs. A day earlier, Trump was in Chicago raising more than $1 million at a campaign event inside his namesake tower along the Chicago River, attracting a smattering of protesters who held a news conference promoted by the Democratic National Committee. On Wednesday, Trump was in neighboring Indiana where he and his family met separately with Gov. Mike Pence and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with a potential pick for running mate to occur as early as Friday. Trump also spoke by phone to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a potential running mate, who also heads the Republican's transition team. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com Twitter @moniquegarcia

Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is facing some tough questions from his estranged wife, ex-Ald. Sandi Jackson, who wants the name, phone number and address of each of his sex partners besides her during their 25-year marriage, according to court documents in their divorce case. Sandi Jackson, 53, also wants to know the date and location of "each and every such incidence of sexual relations," the documents show. The requests, posed through her attorney, emerged late last week in documents in their divorce case in a Washington, D.C., court. In filings, Jackson Jr.'s attorneys have objected to her questions, calling them "entirely irrelevant" to issues before the court, namely whether she should get temporary alimony and attorney fees. His attorney in Chicago said Wednesday that the questions appear "to be nothing more than an attempt to either embarrass or harass Mr. Jackson." Jackson Jr.'s attorney Brendan Hammer said that amid reports Sandi Jackson is writing a book, the judicial process "should not be hijacked for personal purposes outside the litigation, including research for future biographies." A hearing in Washington is scheduled for Friday. On Wednesday, Jackson Jr. moved to have the concurrent divorce proceeding in Cook County dismissed, saying in a statement he wants to protect his two children from unspecified "damaging information." Months ago, Hammer alleged that Sandi Jackson committed "acts" in Illinois that led her husband to file for divorce but declined to say what those acts were, mysteriously commenting only that  they "could be from the benign, to the sublime, to the malign." She has posed other questions to which his side is objecting, court documents show. Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his estranged wife and fellow ex-con, former Chicago Ald. Sandi Jackson, are $1.8 million in debt, the onetime congressman said Tuesday. But Jackson, who is living on around $138,400 a year in federal workers' compensation and Social Security Disability Insurance... Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his estranged wife and fellow ex-con, former Chicago Ald. Sandi Jackson, are $1.8 million in debt, the onetime congressman said Tuesday. But Jackson, who is living on around $138,400 a year in federal workers' compensation and Social Security Disability Insurance... One of her lines of questioning says that if Jackson Jr. contends his spouse was responsible for their estrangement, he should provide the facts behind that and "state the name, address, and telephone number of those people who have personal knowledge of these facts." She also wants to know about any payments he and anyone on his behalf received at his request other than his salary, court documents show. And she wants his correspondence and emails — except to his attorney — that mentions her as far back as 2012. His side said it will hand over such correspondence from this year and last, according to court filings. Details of her request emerged on a day when the warring parties reached accord on one lingering issue: the proper place for the divorce case to be heard. Saying Wednesday he wants to protect his two children from unspecified "damaging information," Jackson Jr., 52, agreed the divorce case should be heard in the nation's capital, where his estranged wife wanted it all along. A judge in the District of Columbia on Thursday slashed the monthly child support payments ex-U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. must make to former Ald.

A judge in the District of Columbia on Thursday slashed the monthly child support payments ex-U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. must make to former Ald. Sandi Jackson as their high-profile divorce case continues in two jurisdictions, court records show. Judge Robert Okun of the Superior Court of the... His comment was in a release from Hammer that indicated he had moved to dismiss the divorce case he filed in Cook County. "This case is and always has been about the protection of my children from damaging information and material not in my possession," the release quoted the former congressman as saying. "It remains the desire of the entire Jackson Family that none of its members, particularly the young children, be subjected to the very damaging emotional and psychological harm that could flow from the introduction of these materials into the public sphere by third parties." Hammer said the comments about "damaging information" came directly from his client and did not elaborate. He also said he did not believe a D.C. judge had ruled on whether Sandi Jackson could have all the information she is seeking. Jackson Jr. lives in Chicago and initiated a divorce proceeding in Cook County last year. Later, his wife followed suit in Washington, where she lives. "For the last five months, four (law) firms have fought almost exclusively about one thing: where will this case proceed?" the release said. "That jurisdictional question has been exceedingly costly in time and legal fees." Sandi Jackson has always believed the case should be heard in D.C. and is pleased the parties now agree, her attorney, Chandra Walker Holloway, said in a statement. "Mrs. Jackson's only concern has been the welfare of her children and (she) looks forward to the resolution of all remaining issues," Holloway said. Hammer said he filed a motion Wednesday asking a Cook County judge to dismiss Jackson Jr.'s petition for dissolution of the marriage. He said Jackson Jr.'s counsel in Washington would file papers to have the case heard there. The release from Hammer also said he and his client looked forward to working with a D.C. attorney in "zealously advocating for Mr. Jackson as he seeks to protect his children, preserve what remains of the parties' estate and obtain a full measure of justice." Both Jacksons resigned from office before pleading guilty in 2013 in federal court in Washington in a case involving his pilfering about $750,000 from his campaign treasury and her failing to report much of the haul on tax returns. Both served prison time, but their terms were staggered so one parent could care for the children, now 17 and 13. The Jacksons wed in Chicago on June 1, 1991, court documents show. kskiba@chicagotribune.com Twitter @KatherineSkiba

A Washington lobbying firm that worked under the direction of Paul Manafort's firm registered Friday with the Justice Department as a foreign agent — the same day a spokesman for Manafort backed off his previous statement that Manafort had decided to register. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, said he was wrong when he told The Associated Press earlier this month that Manafort would register with the Justice Department. Maloni said Manafort, who served as President Donald Trump's campaign chairman, is still considering his options after receiving guidance from the federal authorities about formally disclosing his efforts to influence U.S. policy and public opinion on behalf of a foreign client. As of Friday, two of the lobbying firms involved in the influence campaign on behalf of Ukrainian interests have acknowledged that their work should have been disclosed to the Justice Department. The AP reported in August that Manafort's consulting firm covertly orchestrated the lobbying and public opinion operation on behalf of a pro-Russian political party, the Ukrainian Party of Regions, and its leader, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The latest registration came Friday from Mercury LLC, which disclosed that Manafort was involved in its lobbying work, attending meetings with Mercury managing partner Vin Weber. Weber had previously told the AP that Manafort played no role in Mercury's work. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said Wednesday. Manafort is the second... President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said Wednesday. Manafort is the second... In a statement to the AP, Maloni downplayed Manafort's involvement as it was detailed in Mercury's filing. "One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two-year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans," Maloni said, referring to a meeting Manafort had with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif, who later opposed a 2014 aid package to the government that replaced Yanukovych's. That Rohrabacher meeting was one of four attended by Manafort which were detailed in the filing. Mercury partner Mike McKeon denied that his firm had taken direction from Manafort's firm, DMP International. He said that, in addition to setting up lobbying meetings on behalf of Ukrainian government officials, Mercury had also worked with other Ukrainian political interests. "We work for and under the direction of the Centre, no one else," McKeon wrote in an email to the AP. But emails obtained by the AP last August show that Manafort's firm and his deputy Rick Gates, also a Trump campaign aide, directed Mercury's efforts on specific lobbying tasks. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. The emails show Gates directing Mercury lobbyists to set up meetings between a top Ukrainian official and senators and congressmen on influential committees involving Ukrainian interests. Gates had the firms gather information in the U.S. on a rival lobbying operation and directed efforts to undercut sympathy for Yulia Tymoshenko, an imprisoned rival of Yanukovych. Mercury had announced earlier this month that it would register for the work as a foreign agent after another lobbying firm, The Podesta Group, did so. The Podesta Group acknowledged its work could have benefited the Ukrainian government and should have been disclosed to the government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Mercury's filing says it does not know who ultimately was behind the European Centre, though the group was initially set up in Brussels with members of the Party of Regions on its board. In its retroactive registration Friday, Mercury said it has "no direct knowledge" of what people or entities funded the Centre, but said Mercury's goal was to help Ukraine build closer ties with the European Union. Throughout 2013, the firm also set up "educational events" and meetings that featured Ukrainian government officials and other experts on Ukraine and the EU. It is not clear from the documents whether Mercury's experts were also paid. Among the firm's listed experts were Alfred Gusenbauer, Austria's former chancellor, and Romano Prodi, Italy's former prime minister. The firm said it also arranged meetings with legislators and congressional staffers as well as think tanks and the media. Associated Press writer Jack Gillum contributed to this report.

Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Topspin Gov. Bruce Rauner drew a comparison between Springfield and the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday, saying state government needs to follow the team’s footsteps and rebuild itself. Rauner’s comments came in a Facebook Live event with Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts. Rauner commended Ricketts for turning a team with one of the worst records in baseball into World Series champions. “Sometimes I feel like we in the state of Illinois with our government, we’re the Cubs in about 2013 or something,” Rauner said. “We’re going through restructuring and the transformation. We need to do the same thing, and maybe a couple years from now, Illinois will be champions of America just like you guys have done for baseball.” In 2013, the Cubs finished last in their division with a record of 66-96. The event followed an upbeat Cubs celebration in the House chamber, where lawmakers and other state officials gathered to extol the team’s success and take pictures with the World Series trophy. House Speaker and White Sox fan Michael Madigan, who has kept a low profile in recent weeks, presided over the ceremony. Surrounded by banners and "W" flags, lawmakers officially congratulated the Cubs on their “epic” victory. Fans also took turns sharing stories of what the team means to them, with some pointing to its ability to bring people together. “Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, they all were on one thing: the Cubs,” said Rep. Michael McAuliffe, R-Chicago. “You awoke Chicago and a whole nation.” Others suggested using the team as a model for cooperation under the Capitol dome. “I was thinking how wonderful comments we would have heard today from Theo Epstein and from Joe Maddon, the Zen manager of the Chicago Cubs,” said Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, a Chicago Democrat whose district includes Wrigley Field. "They would probably talk to us about how we shouldn’t look back, how we should only look forward, how we should remove all negative thoughts from our mind and hard feelings and bridge our differences and get to a budget.” (Haley BeMiller) What's on tap *Mayor Rahm Emanuel will talk about the Wilson Red Line station rehab. *Gov.

The coalition also includes the Ounce of Prevention Fund, an early childhood advocacy group whose president is Illinois first lady Diana Rauner, the wife of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. The Protect Our Care Illinois Coalition warned that nearly 1 million Illinois working families would either lose their health insurance or face “onerous” increases in medical costs under the House GOP proposal. About 350,000 Illinois residents purchased private medical coverage through the Obamacare marketplace in 2017, while 650,000 additional residents have been covered by an expansion of Medicaid largely funded by the federal government.

The stunning collapse of the Republican health-care bill now imperils the rest of President Donald Trump's ambitious congressional agenda, with few prospects for quick victory on tax revisions, construction projects or a host of other issues in the months ahead despite complete GOP control of government. While Republicans broadly share the goal of Trump's promised "big tax cuts," the president will have to bridge many of the same divides within his own party that sank the attempted overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. And without savings anticipated from the health-care bill, paying for the "massive" cuts Trump has promised for corporations and middle-class families becomes considerably more complicated. Meanwhile, other marquee agenda items, including a $1 trillion investment in roads and other infrastructure and proposed crackdowns on both legal and illegal immigration, will require the support of Democrats, many of whom have been alienated by the highly partisan start to Trump's tenure. The lone exception for near-term victory could come with the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch - but even that faces the prospect of a threatened filibuster by Democrats. Trump and Republican leaders continued Saturday in their attempts to put a brave face on the health-care debacle. "ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE," Trump wrote in a morning tweet. "Do not worry!" But others in the party acknowledged the political damage sustained by pulling the House bill, particularly for a president who had touted his own dealmaking prowess. Blame for the failure of the Republican health care bill will fall on multiple parties, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who helped craft it, and the conservative and more moderate GOP factions that warred over its details and cost Republicans the unity they needed. But the political impact... Blame for the failure of the Republican health care bill will fall on multiple parties, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who helped craft it, and the conservative and more moderate GOP factions that warred over its details and cost Republicans the unity they needed. But the political impact... "It's a momentum issue," said Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo. "The fact is that, you know, you came out of the gate and you stumbled." Doug Heye, a GOP consultant and former congressional staffer, said Republicans, having achieved control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, were left with a lot to prove. "It sends a troubling sign to a lot of folks about the broader issue of whether Republicans will be able to govern," he said. Trump has said he would have preferred to start his term by cutting "the hell out of taxes." Even before the health-care bill was pulled Friday, the president was already starting to turn the page. Determined to highlight other priorities, Trump staged two announcements in the White House meant to underscore his commitment to creating jobs: granting a construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and appearing with executives of a telecom giant as they pledged to hire thousands of new employees, although the company's plans had already been announced in October. Separately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at an event Friday that he will push Congress to enact comprehensive tax revisions by its August recess, though he acknowledged that the timetable might slip. The White House signaled Saturday that it was eager to move on. Trump's weekly address made no mention of the health-care fight, instead focusing on his signing of legislation authorizing funding for NASA and his commitment to space exploration. "We're going to roll our sleeves up, and we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms," Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday at an appearance in Scott Depot, W. Va. Vice President Mike Pence speaks during a visit to Foster Supply Inc. on Saturday, March 25, 2017, in Scott Depot, W.Va. Pence was in West Virginia to participate in a listening session with small business and job creators in the community.

Pence was in West Virginia to participate in a listening session with small business and job creators in the community. A senior White House official, however, said it was unlikely that Trump would ramp up a major sales effort on retooling taxes immediately, given that his team had been planning on using the coming days to push for Senate action on the health-care bill. Trump's top advisers had envisioned a three-step legislative agenda this year, starting with scaling back President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative. After that was complete, they wanted to move to a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code, followed by the creation of a $1 trillion infrastructure package. The implosion of the health-care effort complicates the tax overhaul both logistically and politically. House Republican leaders had been counting on changes to the tax code included in the health-care bill to make the task of paying for future tax cuts easier. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said the bloc of hard-line Republicans who helped stymie the health-care overhaul were guilty of "ripping the lungs out of tax reform." If they don't revisit the health-care bill immediately, Norquist said, they will soon realize that "they didn't shoot and wound health-care reform, they shot and killed permanent tax reform." House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that the health-care defeat "does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not make it impossible." "We are going to proceed with tax reform," Ryan said. Shortly after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., unveiled the Republican health-care plan on March 6, President Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office and queried his advisers: "Is this really a good bill?" And over the next 18 days, until the bill collapsed in the House on Friday afternoon in a humiliating... Shortly after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., unveiled the Republican health-care plan on March 6, President Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office and queried his advisers: "Is this really a good bill?" And over the next 18 days, until the bill collapsed in the House on Friday afternoon in a humiliating... Hours before the health bill was pulled, Mnuchin said a "comprehensive" overhaul of the tax code should prove less complex. "Health care is a very, very complicated issue," he said at a Friday event hosted by Axios. "In a way, [tax reform is] a lot simpler. It really is." Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, though many Republicans on Capitol Hill have been aiming for a 20 percent rate. Trump has also proposed consolidating the existing seven individual income-tax brackets into three brackets of 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent. Trump's advisers have argued that these changes would trigger a big expansion of economic growth, but some budget analysts have said the changes would widen deficits by anywhere from $2.6 trillion to $7 trillion over 10 years, depending on how it is measured. Many Republicans have long vowed that an overhaul of the tax code must be "revenue neutral," which means they need to find new revenue to offset the reduction in rates. Trump's advisers have not identified specific tax breaks they would eliminate to raise new revenue, and Trump himself often waved away debt concerns during the campaign. Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans are at odds over the wisdom of a key component of tax restructuring. Ryan has proposed a border-adjustment tax that would essentially create new taxes on items imported into the United States as a way to raise close to $1 trillion in new revenue while also providing incentives for companies to move operations to the United States. Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health... Although House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged Friday that "Obamacare is the law of the land," its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Donald Trump's hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health... Many other Republicans oppose this idea, though, and the fight probably will only intensify now. Some Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, S.C., argue that the scheme would drive up prices on consumer goods, and many large retailers are strongly opposed. Given such divides, as well as the mechanics of the budget process, it's highly unlikely that lawmakers will produce a comprehensive tax bill by the August recess, if at all, said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid, D-Nev. "It's clearly not realistic, and it's not going to happen, on policy and political grounds," Manley said, adding that the Republican agenda is also undercut by "a president who's out of his league and doesn't know how to legislate." Republicans had planned to use a budget procedure called "reconciliation" for both the health-care overhaul and for the tax changes, as that would allow them to pass their plans with a simple majority in the Senate and make it impossible for Democrats to block the changes through a filibuster. That's still the plan with a tax overhaul. Barry Bennett, an adviser to Trump during the general election, said he thought it was a "tactical mistake" for the president not to have started his term by pushing for tax changes. "Now you're going to have to carry these battle scars into the tax debate," he said. House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed a win on the Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama's health care law. Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for...

Instead, he suffered a brutal defeat, cancelling a vote and admitting "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future." Friday's painful rebuke is an ominous sign for... Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was a close adviser to Trump during the campaign, said the White House should postpone what is expected to be a messy battle over the tax code and instead pivot toward trying to build a large infrastructure package. Proceeding with infrastructure could attract bipartisan support, he said. Some Democrats and labor unions have said they could support a big infrastructure package, though the White House has not specified how it plans to finance a package that includes roads, bridges, airports and broadband capability, among other things. Mnuchin said Friday that the package would probably include several hundred billion dollars in public money but that the rest would be financed by the private sector, with public support as incentives. Democrats are wary of that approach and prefer more direct government spending. Many Democrats and Republicans have tried - but failed - to pull off tax revisions in recent years. A principal reason changing the tax code is so difficult is because interest groups flood Washington looking for tax cuts but fight vigorously against any measure that would increase their bills. "It's very, very hard to get done," said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who served as economic adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., when he ran for president in 2008. "There are tons of different interests involved, and there are very different views within the Republican Party. Now you are going to enter into a second exercise of that type where you have clear evidence that holdouts can kill it. That empowers the holdouts." Gingrich said the White House could learn some lessons from the failed House health-care effort and change its approach going forward. "I hope [Trump is] going to decide that he has to have a much more hands-on approach to drafting these things and can't just assume that it's going to show up," Gingrich said. President Donald Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint, since it was a blocked number.

Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. "Hello, Bob,"... Despite contentions by White House press secretary Sean Spicer that Trump "left everything on the field" while lobbying for the health-care bill, other Republicans suggested he could have played a more assertive role starting earlier in the process. "If Trump is going to be best advocate, he needs to be more aggressive," Heye said. "I'd try to do some sort of autopsy and figure out how to do this better." Democratic leaders said Republicans would be doomed to failure in future debates if they didn't seek to build more consensus. "We don't know what they'll do with tax reform," said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who warned, "if it's huge tax cuts for the wealthy . . . it won't fly." Looming on the Senate calendar is a confirmation vote for Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Senate Democrats have said they plan to force Gorsuch to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle, forcing Republicans to try to find eight Democrats to cross over and vote to advance the nomination. Republicans have raised the prospect of turning to the "nuclear option" to force through Gorsuch's nomination, a rule change that could further strain relations beyond the parties and undermine prospects for cooperation on other matters. Beyond Gorsuch, Congress is facing a late-April deadline to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government running. That could also spark a partisan clash that could risk a government shutdown. Senate Democrats have warned that they are willing to risk a shutdown fight if Republicans include funding in that package to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall, another marquee campaign promise from Trump. Budget analysts fear Congress must also reach an agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by August or September or the Treasury Department could run out of flexibility to continue paying the government's bills. Trump, on Friday and in the days leading up to the vote, seemed undaunted by the challenges ahead. "I hope that it's going to all work out," he told a House Republican dinner before the collapse of the health-care bill. "Then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they're going to be really fantastic, and I am looking forward to that one. That one's going to be fun."

House Republicans, despite stiff political headwinds, are readying an ambitious push this week to begin moving legislation to replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, a crucial test of their ability to fulfill one of their party’s main campaign promises. The plan marks the first time GOP lawmakers will do this since Obamacare was enacted seven years ago and will provide an early indication of whether President Trump can rally his party’s members of Congress, many of whom are anxious about how to repeal and replace the healthcare law. The legislation could affect health insurance for tens of millions of Americans — not only those with Obamacare coverage, but also people with employer-provided insurance and Medicaid. The House legislation — which was being finalized over the weekend, according to GOP officials — aims to fundamentally restructure the system that Obamacare created, which has extended health coverage to more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans. GOP plans call for scrapping insurance marketplaces that require insurers to offer a basic set of benefits and that provide government subsidies to help low- and moderate-income Americans who don’t get health benefits at work to buy health plans. Republican legislation would lift many requirements for benefits that plans must cover. And it would create a new system of subsidies that are linked to consumers’ age, rather than their income, according to leaked drafts. That would make insurance harder to buy for millions of Americans, especially low-income working people, outside analyses suggest. Republicans confronted a conservative rebellion in their own party Tuesday over their long-promised plans to repeal and replace the health care law, and beseeched President Donald Trump to settle the dispute in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. "He's the leader on this issue right... Republicans confronted a conservative rebellion in their own party Tuesday over their long-promised plans to repeal and replace the health care law, and beseeched President Donald Trump to settle the dispute in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. "He's the leader on this issue right... GOP leaders would eliminate taxes that have helped offset the cost of Obamacare’s coverage expansion, including taxes on medical device makers and insurance companies and on households making more than $250,000 a year. Instead, Republicans are proposing to tax the health insurance that employers provide their workers. Employer-provided benefits are currently tax-free. The change could cause the price of insurance that many Americans get on the job to go up. The House plan would phase out hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid that has allowed many states to expand their Medicaid programs to millions more poor Americans. House Republicans also want to give states more flexibility to reshape their Medicaid programs, allowing states to potentially limit benefits or require poor patients to pay more for their medical care. The GOP plan would eliminate Obamacare’s unpopular insurance mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. In its place, House Republicans have proposed to allow insurers to charge higher premiums to Americans who let their insurance lapse. Most of these proposals are deeply controversial, even within Republican ranks. That is a big reason why Republicans have not previously moved forward with a plan to replace Obamacare. "There is not a consensus at this point," Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” White House officials and senior GOP lawmakers nevertheless are sounding upbeat. “We're putting the finishing touches on our plan,” Vice President Mike Pence said in Wisconsin on Friday on a trip with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to visit House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in his district. And House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), whose committee could hold a hearing on proposed legislation as soon as this week, said he’s confident the president is behind the House plan. “There was no mistaking he is exactly on the same page as House Republicans,” Brady said. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have suggested Congress could send President Trump legislation as soon as this month, even though Republican leaders as of Sunday had still not released the text of their healthcare legislation. Obamacare 101: A periodic primer on the Affordable Care Act » While the Republican-led Congress did pass a bill to repeal large parts of Obamacare, which President Obama vetoed last year, this marks the first time the party will offer a replacement bill and subject it to the scrutiny of congressional hearings and the legislative process. But the GOP faces mounting opposition from major advocacy groups representing patients, doctors, hospitals and now even businesses, a traditional Republican ally. At the same time, internal GOP divisions threaten to derail the legislative campaign before it even gets off the ground. Leading conservatives in the House and Senate have said they will oppose any legislation that does not fully repeal Obamacare, while many Republican senators and governors representing states with major coverage gains have voiced serious reservations about rolling back too much of the existing law. A meeting Friday afternoon between President Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former rival in the GOP primaries, had no set agenda. But Kasich came armed with one anyway: his hope to blunt drastic changes to the nation's health-care system envisioned by some conservatives in Washington. A meeting Friday afternoon between President Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former rival in the GOP primaries, had no set agenda. But Kasich came armed with one anyway: his hope to blunt drastic changes to the nation's health-care system envisioned by some conservatives in Washington. Conservatives have criticized the House GOP plan as “Obamacare-lite,” accusing party leaders of replacing one tax-funded government entitlement with another. “They’re going to have a new tax, a new government subsidy program and a new [insurance] mandate,” charged Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has rallied against the plan with the conservative House Freedom Caucus and influential outside groups such as Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. “Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell need to stand up to those in the Republican Party who are fighting to retain and repair Obamacare, rather than repeal and replace it,” said David McIntosh, president of the free market advocacy group Club for Growth, which is known for backing primary election challenges to wayward Republicans. Together, the conservatives have the votes to potentially tank the House GOP plan because to pass any healthcare legislation, Republican leaders cannot afford to lose more than 18 votes in the House. “Their margins, especially in the Senate, but also in the House, are thin,” warned National Retail Federation vice president Neil Trautwein, a former aid to McConnell. “They have a better chance of getting this out of the House, but it’s not automatic, even though they are taking draconian steps to get their caucus in line. … And what they are doing with this secrecy and locked rooms isn’t helping.” House Republican leaders came under fire last week for only allowing committee members to view drafts of proposed healthcare legislation in a first-floor room of the Capitol that was off limits to Democrats and even Senate Republicans. Many advocacy organizations are urging House Republicans to slow down and allow more time for independent assessments of the legislation. To date, the independent Congressional Budget Office, which lawmakers rely on to calculate the effect of proposed bills, has not released an estimate of how much Republicans’ plans would cost and how many people could lose health coverage. “Making substantial changes to our healthcare system by changing current law would impact tens of millions of our patients,” Dr. Nitin S. Damle, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a letter to House committee leaders last week. “Congress therefore must avoid any unintended adverse consequences,” the letter said, calling for “an open and transparent legislative process.” Under the current GOP plan, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees are expected to hold hearings on different pieces of the legislation as soon as this week. That could allow the full House to vote on an Obamacare repeal bill by as early as the end of the month and send it to the Senate, where a much longer debate is expected. John Desser, a former health official in the George W. Bush administration and former aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), predicted Ryan would rally his caucus and get the 218 votes he’ll need. “The speaker has lived and breathed health policy for over two decades, and may just be perfectly positioned … to bring together his conference and explain the opportunity they have to get this right to reluctant or recalcitrant members,” he said. But Desser, now a vice president for eHealth, an online insurance marketplace, cautioned that other challenges await. “Getting it through the Senate after that may require the gravity-defying leadership of Mr. Trump and his team,” he said. noam.levey@latimes.com @noamlevey ALSO President Trump wants to create a national private school choice program.

A meeting Friday afternoon between President Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former rival in the GOP primaries, had no set agenda. But Kasich came armed with one anyway: his hope to blunt drastic changes to the nation's health-care system envisioned by some conservatives in Washington. Over the next 45 minutes, according to Kasich and others briefed on the session, the governor made his pitch while the president eagerly called in several top aides and then got Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on the phone. At one point, senior adviser Jared Kushner reminded his father-in-law that House Republicans are sketching out a different approach to providing access to coverage. "Well, I like this better," Trump replied, according to a Kasich adviser. The freewheeling session, which concluded with the president instructing Price and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to meet with Kasich the next day, underscores the unorthodox way the White House is proceeding as Republicans work to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else. The day after Kasich delivered his impromptu tutorial, Trump spent lunch discussing the same topic with two other GOP governors with a very different vision - Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida. Scott said Sunday that he used the lunch to press for principles he has pushed publicly, such as financial compensation for states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA and the importance of providing competition and cutting required benefits to allow people to "buy insurance that fits them." While leaving most of the detail work to lawmakers, top White House aides are divided on how dramatic an overhaul effort the party should pursue. And the biggest wild card remains the president himself, who has devoted only a modest amount of time to the grinding task of mastering health-care policy but has repeatedly suggested that his sweeping new plan is nearly complete. This conundrum will be on full display Monday, when Trump meets at the White House with some of the nation's largest health insurers. The session, which will include top executives from Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna and Humana, is not expected to produce a major policy announcement. But it will provide an opportunity for one more important constituency to lobby the nation's leader on an issue he has said is at the top of his agenda. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is followed by reporters as he leaves a health care meeting during the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington, Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is followed by reporters as he leaves a health care meeting during the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington, Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017. Democrats and their allies are already mobilizing supporters to hammer lawmakers about the possible impact of rolling back the ACA, holding more than 100 rallies across the country Saturday. And a new analysis for the National Governors Association that modeled the effect of imposing a cap on Medicaid spending - a key component of House Republicans' strategy - provided Democrats with fresh ammunition because of its finding that the number of insured Americans could fall significantly. Trump, for his part, continues to express confidence about his administration's ostensible plan. He suggested Wednesday that it would be out within a few weeks. "So we're doing the health care - again, moving along very well - sometime during the month of March, maybe mid- to early March, we'll be submitting something that I think people will be very impressed by," he told reporters during a budget meeting in the Roosevelt Room. Yet some lawmakers, state leaders and policy experts who have discussed the matter with either Trump or his top aides say the administration is largely delegating the development of an ACA substitute to Capitol Hill. The president, who attended part of a lengthy heath-care policy session his aides held at Mar-a-Lago a week ago, appears more interested in brokering specific questions, such as how to negotiate drug prices, than in steering the plan's drafting. President Donald Trump said Friday that his predecessor's health care law covers "very few people," as he minimized the impact of replacing it. That's only true if you consider more than 20 million people to be very few. Here's a look at his statement at the Conservative Political Action Conference... President Donald Trump said Friday that his predecessor's health care law covers "very few people," as he minimized the impact of replacing it. That's only true if you consider more than 20 million people to be very few. Here's a look at his statement at the Conservative Political Action Conference... "The legislative branch, the House first and foremost, is providing the policy," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who noted that the White House lacks "a big policy shop" and that Price and some key principals just recently got in place. Seema Verma, whom Trump has nominated to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, should play a key role in any reform effort if she is confirmed. In the current process, the White House becomes "the political sounding board" in altering Obamacare, as the 2010 law is known, "and the final voice of reason is what the Senate can accept," Cole said. Within the administration, aides are debating how far and fast Republicans can afford to move when it comes to undoing key aspects of the ACA. White House officials declined to comment for this story. Several people in Trump's orbit are eager to make bold changes to reduce the government's role in the health-care system. That camp includes Vice President Mike Pence, who told conservative activists last week that "America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end," as well as Domestic Policy Council aides Andrew Bremberg and Katy Talento and National Economic Council aide Brian Blase. Blase, who most recently worked as a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, published a paper in December titled "Replacing the Affordable Care Act the Right Way." Its conservative blueprint emphasized the "need to reduce government bias towards comprehensive coverage" for all Americans and a revamping of Medicaid, which was expanded under the ACA and added 11 million Americans to the rolls. "Medicaid needs fundamental reform with the goals of dramatically reducing the number of people enrolled in the program and providing a higher-quality program for remaining enrollees," Blase wrote. Other White House advisers, according to multiple individuals who asked for anonymity to describe private discussions, have emphasized the potential political costs to moving aggressively. That group includes Kushner, NEC Director Gary Cohn, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. Asked by George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC's "This Week," whether Trump "won't touch Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid," White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, "Look, the president is committed to doing that. ... And I don't see any reason to start thinking differently." Where Trump will end up remains unclear, although in both public and private settings he has tended to stress the importance of providing health coverage"for everybody"while lowering its cost. However, Price testified during his recent confirmation hearings that the administration would seek to give Americans access to, not guaranteed, coverage. The policy proposal Trump has embraced most forcefully, albeit not always consistently, is to pressure pharmaceutical firms to lower their prices by negotiating government drug purchases through Medicare. The idea has considerable support among Democrats and from some Republicans but is currently prohibited under law. Kasich has proposed paring back some of the ACA's more generous aspects, such as reducing the number of benefits insurers are required to offer and potentially cutting the eligibility level for Medicaid recipients from 138 percent of the poverty level to 100 percent if there is a stable marketplace with adequate subsidies they can join. He also wants states to have more flexibility in how they manage their Medicaid programs, as well as aspects of the private insurance market. But he has expressed skepticism about turning Medicaid funding into a block grant and opposes any move that would eliminate the coverage many adults in his state now have without a clear path to transition them to new plans. "Frankly the reason why people are on Medicaid is because they don't have any money," he said Friday. "So what are we supposed to say, 'Work harder?' " Asked to describe Trump's reaction to his overall approach, the Ohio governor replied, "What he said is, he found it interesting. . . . It takes time, so you have to explain it, and explain it again." The Washington Post's Dan Balz contributed to this report.

Democratic Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Wednesday acknowledged a Republican plan to replace Obamacare could blow a huge hole in the county budget, but vowed to find the money to provide health care for hundreds of thousands of residents who could lose coverage. Preckwinkle said the bill unveiled this week by House Republicans in Washington, "is not terribly encouraging; in fact, it's pretty discouraging." Particularly troubling, Preckwinkle said, is the GOP proposal to roll back the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. "What we've seen thus far from the House of Representatives will ultimately result in fewer people having access to health care coverage, especially those who rely on expanded Medicaid," Preckwinkle told reporters after a county board meeting. "We can only hope that sanity prevails in the upcoming debate." According to Dr. John Jay Shannon, the county health system's CEO, roughly 350,000 people in Cook County now get health insurance thanks to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. Another 100,000 to 150,000 are insured through Obamacare marketplace plans, he said. In all, Preckwinkle said, county government's taxpayer subsidy to the health care system has gone down $289 million since 2010, "partly due to efficiencies but mostly due to the substitution of federal dollars for local dollars." Shannon has said about $200 million of that is due to Medicaid expansion. It's not clear how much those expenses would go back up under the GOP proposal, and it's far from certain the plan will pass in its present form. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner on Tuesday said he's worried Illinois "won't do very well" if the proposed U.S. House Republican Obamacare replacement plan becomes law.

Bruce Rauner on Tuesday said he's worried Illinois "won't do very well" if the proposed U.S. House Republican Obamacare replacement plan becomes law. The governor's comments were his first since congressional Republicans unveiled their changes Monday. The plan would cut federal... Preckwinkle said the county would cover the added costs, but declined to say where she'd get the money. In recent years, Preckwinkle has pushed through a sales tax hike and a new sweetened beverage tax. The two-term board president said the county health system has existed for almost 200 years, and "we're not going to turn our backs on that legacy. We will continue to provide the care that we've always provided. We'll have to find another way to do it." Republicans have proposed per-capita health care spending similar to block grants as an alternative to the Medicaid expansion. That would be a particular problem here because Illinois gets relatively little federal matching money per capita compared with other states, Shannon said. Illinois health care leaders spent weeks bracing themselves for the worst as they awaited a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. This week, that Obamacare replacement bill finally arrived — and it would mean significant changes for more than 356,000 Illinois residents who have coverage through...

Preckwinkle said she spoke to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner last week about the hit Illinois would take under the GOP plan and asked him to reach out to Republican members of the state's congressional delegation to urge them not to support rolling back the Medicaid expansion. On Tuesday, Rauner said he had talked with fellow governors and members of the Trump administration about his concerns regarding Medicaid. His "first-blush read" was that Illinois "won't do very well under the changes that they're recommending, which is a big concern to me," Rauner said. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne

Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Wednesday said she was "deeply troubled" by the actions of President Donald Trump's White House during his first few weeks in office, singling out his administration's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and limit immigration. She called the Affordable Care Act — widely known as Obamacare — a "godsend" that helped provide medical insurance to 480,000 people in the county last year. A large portion of them use the county Health and Hospitals System, with most insured through an Obamacare expansion of Medicaid that Dr. John Jay Shannon, the system's CEO, said covers $200 million in yearly county costs. That $200 million makes up most of the $289 million drop in taxpayer costs for the health system over the last seven years. So if the federal government were to eliminate that Medicaid expansion and not replace it in some way, the county could face significant financial woes. That's a scenario Preckwinkle previously described as a "nightmare," and on Wednesday, she did not sound optimistic that Congress would find a way to maintain existing health care coverage levels. "We've heard the president and members of Congress talk about repeal and replace, and now repair," Preckwinkle said. "The one 'R' that's missing is reality. The Republicans voted more than 60 times in the House to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but apparently never thought during that period what they might replace it with." Trump during his campaign pledged to quickly repeal and replace Obamacare, but last weekend told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that it's "very complicated" and could take more than a year to complete the effort. Local leaders pleaded with Chicagoans on Tuesday to sign up for health insurance through Obamacare — and to speak out in support of the health care law — as Republican leaders in Congress continued their promises to tear it down.

Local leaders pleaded with Chicagoans on Tuesday to sign up for health insurance through Obamacare — and to speak out in support of the health care law — as Republican leaders in Congress continued their promises to tear it down. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Democratic U.S. Rep.... Preckwinkle also struck a defiant tone when it came to the county's status as a sanctuary county, where government officials don't ask about residents' immigration status or hold detainees set for release from the county jail at the request of federal immigration officials unless there's an arrest warrant. She talked about Trump's now-suspended executive order barring entry to the United States by immigrants from seven mostly Muslim nations, saying it displayed Trump's "seeming disdain for immigrants who live among us." She described the effort as "a Muslim ban" that's "shameful." "Cook County is a sanctuary county," Preckwinkle said. "We're proud of it. We have been for 10 years. We've been very clear that we'll follow the law, but we will not be immigration enforcement agents." Asked if the county would reconsider maintaining its sanctuary status even if the federal government pulled county government funding, Preckwinkle said, “I am not prepared to do that.” She also referred to the lawsuit brought by Minnesota and Washington state governments that led to the suspension of Trump's immigration order. "We'll see what happens as these matters proceed through the courts, but we'll take whatever measures we believe are necessary to protect and defend the residents of our county," she said. "We are prepared to figure out how to resist, should resistance be necessary." hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

Days after Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle cast a tie-breaking vote to approve a new sweetened beverage tax, commissioners on Tuesday easily approved her budget for next year. The County Board voted 11-4 to approve the $4.9 billion spending plan, balanced in large part with money from the new soda pop tax that starts July 1. Preckwinkle cut costs by $78.5 million, in part by laying off 300 of the county's 22,200 or so employees, but day-to-day county operating costs are rising by about $90 million. That's a 2.7 percent increase from last year. It's driven largely by increased county worker pension fund contributions, increasing debt payments set in motion before Preckwinkle took office six years ago, reductions in grant funding and salary hikes contained in county worker union contracts approved by the board during the last year. All four Republicans voted against the budget, but some of the Democrats who had opposed the beverage tax last week gave Preckwinkle's spending plan a green light Tuesday. Preckwinkle said she always finds that kind of disconnect "a little bit of an ironic position to take." Commissioner John Fritchey of Chicago, who was one of the Democrats voting against the tax hike but for the budget, explained it this way: "While I didn't agree (with) or support some of the revenues in this budget, this is a budget that continues to take Cook County in the right direction, a vastly different direction than when you came here." Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle personally ensured her controversial new penny-an-ounce pop tax passed Thursday by breaking a rare tie vote among commissioners. The two-term board president stepped further into the glare of a spotlight because she's counting on the $224 million a year... Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle personally ensured her controversial new penny-an-ounce pop tax passed Thursday by breaking a rare tie vote among commissioners. The two-term board president stepped further into the glare of a spotlight because she's counting on the $224 million a year... Part of the county's increased costs will be paid for with a new penny-an-ounce tax on artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages, which under revised figures put out Tuesday is expected to generate $73.7 million next year and about $221 million a year in 2018. The tax was approved last Thursday, when Preckwinkle broke a rare tie vote. The move adds 72 cents to a six-pack of soda. Although public health advocates heralded passage of the soda pop tax, saying it will reduce consumption of sugary beverages that contribute to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and tooth decay, beverage industry and retail trade groups opposed the tax, saying it would hurt businesses and push people across county borders to do their shopping. This week, the nonprofit, Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation decried the new tax, questioning whether it will have the desired health effects, calling it a regressive tax and concluding that even if it does, the money brought in will be lower than expected. "It is far from clear whether these measures will achieve the promised gains in health improvement, and they will disproportionately impact lower-income consumers," the corporately funded group stated in a news release. "Narrow taxes such as these are also volatile revenue sources that could create fiscal uncertainty." Last week, the board also approved an ordinance barring further sales tax increases, or property tax increases beyond the rate of inflation, before 2020. That's in keeping with Preckwinkle's pledge not to increase taxes for the next two years, which pushes that issue off until after the 2018 election. Cook County, with its 5.2 million residents, will become the largest region in the nation to put in place a pop tax. Preckwinkle framed up the soda pop tax as a way to avoid making cuts to the county's criminal justice system — affecting prosecutors, public defenders and sheriff's deputies — and the county's public health system. Asked after last week's vote why the county could not make further spending cuts, Preckwinkle defended her record, saying she had reduced the workforce by 10 percent and overall debt by a slightly greater percentage. The sweetened beverage tax comes after Preckwinkle successfully sought a 1-percentage-point county sales tax hike last year. That tax hike generates about $474 million a year, with the money going to increase contributions to the county worker pension system, to stop diverting gas tax money to non-transportation purposes and to make the increased payments on the county's debt. Money from the new sweetened beverage tax will cover the rising costs of day-to-day operations. The two tax hikes represent a role reversal for Preckwinkle, who in 2010 campaigned on a later-fulfilled pledge to roll back what remained of a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax increase approved under her predecessor, Todd Stroger. hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

Cook County taxpayers will be out an extra $1.6 million after mistakes were made in seeking federal grant funding for the county Department of Homeland Security. County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said Wednesday that the errors were discovered after she fired Ernest Brown from his post as the agency's executive director of homeland security and an internal investigation of the department was conducted. Preckwinkle, however, said she did not dismiss Brown because of suspicions about financial issues. Instead, she was reacting to a media report of crimes committed by now-convicted police officers working in public housing during the 2000s, when Brown was their commander. "I asked for his resignation," Preckwinkle said. "He declined to resign, so I fired him. I did so on the basis of information that I learned about his tenure in the Chicago Police Department. I lost confidence in his ability to lead the department (of Homeland Security)." Brown was dismissed in November, and died in January of an apparent heart attack suffered at a South Loop restaurant. The county found invoices that were not submitted to the state for federal grant reimbursement. Officials said the state oversees more than $21 million in Urban Area Security Initiative program grant funds the county receives each year. Most of the $1.6 million in question was for training purposes for homeland security programs, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency later denied reimbursement. The state agency said the expenses were ineligible "because the federal procurement guidelines were not followed and pre-approvals were not obtained," said Martha Martinez, who heads up the county's Bureau of Administration. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Wednesday that the federal gas tax should be raised by up to 10 cents per gallon during a discussion of the $1 trillion infrastructure plan being touted by President Donald Trump. The mayor was speaking at a Wall Street Journal-sponsored breakfast in Washington when an audience... Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Wednesday that the federal gas tax should be raised by up to 10 cents per gallon during a discussion of the $1 trillion infrastructure plan being touted by President Donald Trump. The mayor was speaking at a Wall Street Journal-sponsored breakfast in Washington when an audience... The County Board on Wednesday approved spending $1.6 million in local taxpayer money to cover the mistakes, though officials said they still hope to convince the state to pay about $534,000 that covered salaries. Meanwhile, the county Homeland Security Department was placed under the supervision of the administration bureau. The county has hired two people and might hire two more to oversee the grant process. At least part of those salaries would be covered with grant funds, officials said. And the Homeland Security Department, now being run by interim Executive Director Mark Edingburg, will have to prepare quarterly and annual reports on grant funding. "There are several layers of corrective action that are being taken," Preckwinkle told county commissioners before the vote. Preckwinkle hired Brown in October 2015. At the time, he was police chief in west suburban Darien. While in the Chicago Police Department, he had climbed to the rank of chief of patrol and at one time was viewed as a possible contender for the superintendent's post.

Topspin Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown’s latest effort to upgrade her office’s out-of-date computer system stalled... From 2000 to 2002, Brown commanded Chicago police officers assigned to public housing. During those years, a sergeant and officer under his command were arrested and convicted of robbing a purported drug stash house of $20,000 in cash and what appeared to be 11 pounds of cocaine. Brown's leadership of police in public housing and his relationship to later-convicted Sgt. Ronald Watts was noted in a story by Jamie Kalven of the Invisible Institute — a story about corrupt cops and the police code of silence that Preckwinkle said brought issues surrounding Brown to her attention. hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

Cook County commissioners on Tuesday advanced Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown's plan to spend $36.5 million to install a new case-management system, after she agreed to hire an additional company to oversee the project at the request of distrustful commissioners. Commissioners last month had balked at approving the contract, with Larry Suffredin, D-Evanston, describing Brown's office as one whose "reputation is not at the highest level right now." Since then, Brown agreed to seek bids for a second company to help oversee installation of a new case-management system to replace one that's based on outdated mainframe technology. The additional contract is expected to add more than $1 million to the cost. "That seemed reasonable to me, to protect a $36 million investment," Suffredin said. "For me, it's because I do not trust Dorothy Brown's staff." On Tuesday, the County Board Finance Committee voted unanimously to approve a five-year contract with Plano, Texas-based Tyler Technologies to set up the new system. The move clears the way for a final board vote on Wednesday. Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who last month spoke in favor of the Tyler Technologies contract, supports hiring the oversight company, said spokesman Frank Shuftan. "It is a best practice in large government tech projects," he said. Federal prosecutors alleged for the first time on Friday that Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown took a $15,000 bribe disguised as a business loan from a man seeking a job with her office.

An attorney for Brown, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said the payment was a legitimate... No matter how well the computer system conversion goes, there is concern about how efficiently it will be used by Brown's staff. She has long faced criticism for the state of court records. Preckwinkle said last month that "we're working to address concerns about user error." The contract with Tyler includes two other companies that will provide training and convert data for the new system. Brown last year was elected to a fifth term in office, even after the county Democratic Party withdrew its endorsement after details surfaced about a U.S. attorney's investigation into allegations that bribes were being paid for jobs and promotions in her office. hdardick@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ReporterHal

All 20 of Illinois' electors cast their vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Monday, a bittersweet finish for many who had hoped to claim the state as the birthplace of the nation's first female president. Instead, the group of Illinois Democrats Monday morning prepared to watch their Republican Electoral College colleagues in other states ultimately decide the contest for President-elect Donald Trump, who in the Nov. 8 election won enough states to capture 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. "Surely, it's a historic occasion whenever the Electoral College meets, it was a big disappointment for me, being a Hillary delegate to the convention and an elector," said Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who also served as chairwoman overseeing Illinois' electoral vote. "But this is our American system of democracy, and we are going to move ahead." Illinois electors cast their ballots in a small hearing room inside the state Capitol, one by one dropping paper ballots into a wood box. Many paused for a photographer who was there to document the vote, with some giving brief remarks. Elector Vera Davis, the wife of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, said she thanked God for the privilege to vote for the first woman to be nominated by a major party. Former Democratic state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash called for a "thorough, independent investigation" of the election as outgoing President Barack Obama and the nation's intelligence agencies contend that Russia interfered in the country's political system. The vote comes amid renewed attention on the Electoral College for choosing a leader given Trump's unconventional candidacy and Clinton's 2.8 million lead in the popular vote. Tim Mapes, Executive Director at Democratic Party of Illinois, peeks into the Illinois Electoral College Ballot Box as elector Shirley McCombs counts the ballots Monday, Dec. 19, 2016, in Springfield, Ill. Illinois members of the Electoral College cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton for president. Tim Mapes, Executive Director at Democratic Party of Illinois, peeks into the Illinois Electoral College Ballot Box as elector Shirley McCombs counts the ballots Monday, Dec. 19, 2016, in Springfield, Ill. Illinois members of the Electoral College cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton for president. Even so, Preckwinkle dismissed calls to eliminate the Electoral College as "a waste of time and energy," saying "it's better just to focus on winning by the rules of the game as they are." "The system is what it is, and those of us who wished for a different outcome in this election better get working," Preckwinkle said, adding Democrats must focus on organizing and recruiting younger voters. "I am 69 years old and all the candidates who were running for president are my age and older, so we've clearly got some problems in both parties about the next generation of leadership," Preckwinkle said. Before the vote, a small group of protesters gathered inside the Capitol rotunda, unfurling a "Stop Trump" banner and chanting, "Vote your conscience." The demonstration wasn't needed to sway Illinois' electors. The state voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, who was born in Chicago and raised in suburban Park Ridge. Clinton won 55.8 percent of the vote in Illinois, compared with 38.8 percent for Trump. Illinois has passed a state law that pledges to honor the popular vote when casting electoral votes. Organizers said their efforts were primarily focused on Republican electors in red states, but they wanted to make their voices heard across the country. "We wanted to have a strong presence in all 50 state capitols to show that people everywhere are calling on the electors to stop Trump," said Erica Sagrans, a Chicago resident representing the December 19th Coalition, which comprises various progressive groups. Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, said serving as an elector caused "hot flashes and anxiety," saying the pressure of officially deciding the outcome of the presidential election should not fall on the 538 members of the Electoral College, but the voters. "One man, one vote should mean something and we in the Electoral College should not take that away," Ammons said. Still, Ammons said it was "an awesome experience to be able to really cast a vote for who the people of Illinois selected, and who I think the people of the nation selected: Sen. Clinton." Following the vote, electors posed for a photograph on the Capitol's grand staircase, where elector Pam Cullerton called over husband, John Cullerton, president of the Illinois Senate, to hold her purse. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com

There were many protesters but few faithless electors as Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote Monday â ensuring he will become America's 45th president. An effort by anti-Trump forces to persuade Republican electors to abandon the president-elect came to practically nothing and the process unfolded largely according to its traditions. Trump's polarizing victory Nov. 8 and the fact Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the national popular vote had stirred an intense lobbying effort, but to no avail. "We did it!" Trump tweeted Monday evening. "Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media)." He later issued a statement saying: "With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans." Even one of Trump's fiercest Republican rivals, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, said it was time to get behind the president-elect. "We want unity, we want love," Kasich said as Ohio's electors voted to back Trump at a statehouse ceremony. Kasich refused to endorse or even vote for Trump in the election. With all states voting, Trump finished with 304 votes and Clinton had 227. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes. Befitting an election filled with acrimony, thousands of protesters converged on state capitols across the country Monday, urging Republican electors to abandon their party's winning candidate. More than 200 demonstrators braved freezing temperatures at Pennsylvania's capitol, chanting, "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!" and "No treason, no Trump!" In Madison, Wisconsin, protesters shouted, cried and sang "Silent Night." In Augusta, Maine, they banged on drums and held signs that said, "Don't let Putin Pick Our President," referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the noise outside state Capitols, inside, the voting went pretty much as planned. In Nashville, Tennessee, one audience member tried to read out some Scripture before the ballots were cast, but was told he could not speak. "We certainly appreciate the Scripture," State Election Coordinator Mark Goins said from the podium. "The answer is no." With all Republican states reporting, Trump lost only the two electors in Texas. One voted for Kasich, the Ohio governor; the other voted for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. Clinton lost four electors in Washington state â three voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell and one voted for Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle. She also lost an elector in Hawaii to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton beat Sanders in the Democratic primaries. Jumping ahead of investigators, President-elect Donald Trump is blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly violence in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. Authorities in both countries were still investigating Monday when Trump issued a pair of statements... Jumping ahead of investigators, President-elect Donald Trump is blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly violence in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. Authorities in both countries were still investigating Monday when Trump issued a pair of statements... Several Democratic electors in other states tried to vote for protest candidates but they either changed their votes to Clinton or were replaced. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. Republican electors were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, elector Charlie Buckels reached out to Trump's opponents after the New York businessman got all of the state's eight votes. "For those of you who wished it had gone another way, I thank you for being here," said Buckels, the state GOP finance chairman. "I thank you for your passion for our country." There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote for the candidate who won their state â though some states require their electors to vote for the winning candidate. Those laws, however, are rarely tested. More than 99 percent of electors through U.S. history have voted for the candidate who won their state. Of those who refused, none has ever been prosecuted, according to the National Archives. Some Democrats have argued that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more weight to less populated states. That is how Clinton, who got more than 2.8 million more votes nationwide, lost the election to Trump. Some have also tried to dissuade Trump voters by arguing that he is unsuited to the job. Others cite the CIA's assessment that Russia engaged in computer hacking to sway the election in favor of the Republican. There have been a total of 157 faithless voters to date, according to FairVote.org, a nonprofit that advocates for national popular-vote elections for president. There have been a total of 157 faithless voters to date, according to FairVote.org, a nonprofit that advocates for national popular-vote elections for president. "When the founders of our country created (the Electoral College) 200-plus years ago, they didn't have confidence in the average white man who had property, because that's who got to vote," said Shawn Terris, a Democratic elector from Ventura, California. "It just seems so undemocratic to me that people other than the voters get to choose who leads the country." A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner â almost certainly Trump â will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Associated Press

As students increasingly forgo pencil and paper in favor of keyboards and touch screens to write everything from essays to notes to friends, some worry that the cursive lessons marked by hours of drawing looped letters on lined pages may soon disappear. Now, Illinois lawmakers are getting involved in the debate over whether schools should be required to teach cursive writing even in today's technology-dominated classrooms. The lawmaker pushing the idea says being taught the fancy text can improve students' learning abilities and help them read handwritten notes from their grandparents. The Illinois House has advanced legislation to require cursive instruction, moving it to the Senate for further debate. That's despite criticism that mandatory lessons would put another burden on schools already struggling to meet other goals with limited time and money. Currently, the state lets local school districts decide whether to teach cursive, said Jackie Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Illinois State Board of Education. Chicago Public Schools, for example, doesn't require cursive instruction, but principals can choose to add it to their school's curriculum. Plainfield Community Consolidated School District 202 and Naperville Community Unit School District 203, on the other hand, require cursive to be taught to second-graders. Indian Prairie School District 204, which includes Aurora and Bolingbrook, doesn't require cursive instruction, but a spokeswoman for the district said most second-grade teachers incorporate it into lessons. Rep. Emanuel "Chris" Welch, the Hillside Democrat pushing the state requirement, said schools would not have to create a separate cursive class. Instead, they could incorporate it into existing courses. Welch said cursive allows people to sign checks, mortgage papers and legal documents, and he contended people who don't know how to write script are more vulnerable to identity theft. He also noted that people who write in cursive can read it as well. "They can read the notes from their mother and grandmother," he said. "They can read our historical documents like the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution." And advocates including the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation say cursive improves students' reading, spelling and retention skills, as well as making them more focused. "It really benefits them in a lot of ways," said Sheila Lowe, the foundation's president. Not everyone is convinced. Some opponents say that the state shouldn't make the decision for local schools and that a one-size-fits-all approach won't work well. "I think that local school districts have a better understanding of what their schools need to achieve," said Zach Messersmith, assistant director of government relations for the Illinois Association of School Boards. If the requirement eventually becomes law, Illinois would join a handful of other states, including Alabama and Tennessee, that mandate cursive instruction. Earlier this month, Welch had to postpone a vote on his plan because some Republicans lined up to speak out against the plan, with one saying the writing style is outdated. "I appreciate that a lot of people miss seeing cursive in the classroom, but times change," said Rep. Mike Fortner, R-West Chicago. "Our world has changed." Welch said he used lawmakers' two-week spring break to try sway his colleagues. In an ironic twist, part of his lobbying effort traded old-school handwritten notes for posts on Facebook and Twitter. In one, he displayed a photo of the vote tally of the first bill he ever sponsored, showing a piece of paper covered in signatures from other lawmakers. When the plan was called for a vote in the Illinois House this week, it did win the support of some Republicans and advanced to the Senate by a 67-48 vote. After all, one lawmaker contended, the state already requires the teaching of all kinds of things. "Yes, it is an issue of local control, but if you look at the school code, outside of the core studies, we have mandated a course of instruction on Bird and Arbor Day, on 'Just Say No' day, on Irish famine study," said Rep. David Harris, R-Arlington Heights. "Really? Irish famine study? I think cursive could be just as important as Irish famine study." hbemiller@chicagotribune.com Twitter @haleybemiller

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan on Thursday met for the first time since budget negotiations broke down in December, with both sides offering up different versions of what went down as the Capitol impasse nears the two-year mark. The roughly 40-minute private meeting was revealed in a pair of dueling statements, with Madigan calling on Rauner to "focus" on a spending plan and the governor contending the speaker "hinted" he may be open to the economic and political changes Rauner has made a prerequisite to a deal. Neither side was willing to provide further details about the morning confab, which comes as lawmakers enter the final month of the spring legislative session and traditionally work to craft the state's annual spending plan. "I requested a meeting with Gov. Rauner to ensure he understood my desire to pass a full-year budget and discuss the urgent need for a resolution to the state budget impasse," Madigan said. "Schools, human service providers, rating agencies and thousands of others have asked us to do one thing — pass a budget. I ask the governor to turn his focus to the budget." Madigan has long said a budget agreement could be reached if Rauner put aside his economic agenda, which now includes a property tax freeze and changes to the state's workers' compensation system to cut costs for businesses. But the Rauner administration said the meeting provided hope that Madigan may be coming around to the governor's ideas. "For the first time in more than two years, Speaker Madigan today hinted that he may be willing to enact a truly balanced budget with changes that will help create jobs, properly fund our schools and lower property taxes," said Rauner spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis, who added that "it's too soon to tell if the speaker will ultimately agree to follow through." At the Capitol, the so-called grand bargain proved to be a grand illusion. Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle haven't done much to knock down speculation that they're on the way out of the legislature. The over-the-top rhetoric is back in full effect. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has returned... At the Capitol, the so-called grand bargain proved to be a grand illusion. Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle haven't done much to knock down speculation that they're on the way out of the legislature. The over-the-top rhetoric is back in full effect. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has returned... And so it seems not much has changed in the months since the camps have met, save for the state's deepening financial problems and growing uncertainty for higher education and the state's social safety net. Illinois has gone without a complete budget since July 2015, after Rauner vetoed most of the out-of-balance spending plan sent to him by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. Democrats didn't send him a budget last year. Still, money has continued to go out the door under a patchwork of court orders and temporary spending agreements. The latest stopgap budget expired at the start of the year, leaving universities, community colleges and social service providers without funding. The House approved legislation this month that would free up $815 million from special funds for higher education and social services, but the Senate has yet to act as some lawmakers are still hoping to reach a broader agreement. A credit ratings agency is again raising the alarm over Illinois' historic budget impasse, saying a failure to put in place a complete spending plan by the end of the spring session could result in Illinois defaulting on loans, cutting pension contributions and "long-term damage" to universities... A credit ratings agency is again raising the alarm over Illinois' historic budget impasse, saying a failure to put in place a complete spending plan by the end of the spring session could result in Illinois defaulting on loans, cutting pension contributions and "long-term damage" to universities... Dozens of higher education advocates gathered outside the Capitol on Thursday to call for funding, chanting "save our schools" and "Rauner's gotta go." Some universities recently saw their credit ratings lowered because of a lack of money during the stalemate, and schools have laid off workers and cut programs. They were joined by two of the Democratic candidates for governor, Sen. Daniel Biss of Evanston and billionaire entrepreneur J.B. Pritzker. Also running are Chicago businessman Chris Kennedy, Ald. Ameya Pawar and downstate school Superintendent Bob Daiber. "Who thinks Bruce Rauner's doing a great job? I can tell you who. Universities in Wisconsin think that Bruce Rauner's doing a great job. Universities in Iowa and Indiana and Missouri," Biss said. "They think Bruce Rauner's (doing) a great job sending our young people out of Illinois, making our colleges and universities unaffordable, slashing programs, harming faculty, sending people fleeing this state, hurting our families, hurting our communities, hurting our economy." Rauner has railed against the latest one-time spending proposal, saying it will add to the state's debt without putting in place the economic changes he's called for as part of a budget deal. "People think that we are arguing about the budget in Illinois. They think the issue is about the budget. What it really is, is about whether or not we are going to become a growth state or not," Rauner told a group of business leaders this week. "When people say the most important thing is a budget, they mean more deficit spending." Rauner chief of staff  Richard Goldberg told a Senate panel  there are a few more weeks left in the session to strike a deal. At times he put the onus for Illinois' problems on the General Assembly, much to the consternation of Democrats who control it. "The state government in areas where the governor can control without the General Assembly getting in his way and stopping things and being obstructionist just to try to slow progress is better off," Goldberg said when asked whether the state is better or worse off since Rauner took office. "And areas where we cannot do anything without approval of the General Assembly, you know, that's self-evident." Democrats accused the governor of failing to show leadership. "When you try to just push this all off on the General Assembly, that's not the definition of a leader in my estimation," said Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago. In other action, the Senate approved legislation that would allow Illinois to license gun dealers, an effort supporters say would crack down on irresponsible sellers behind the city's gun violence. Opponents argue gun shops already are regulated by the federal government. Meanwhile, the House passed a measure that would allow for the automatic expungement of a juvenile's criminal record. The effort comes out of the governor's bipartisan criminal justice reform panel, which was charged with finding ways to cut the state's prison population. Supporters say wiping a minor's record will allow them to find jobs and go to college and break out of the cycle of crime. hbemiller@chicagotribune.com mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com

Update: Later Thursday, sponsoring Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie put a procedural hold on the bill, meaning it has passed both chambers but has not been sent to the governor. The Illinois House on Thursday sent Gov. Bruce Rauner legislation designed to stabilize two city worker pension funds, but the measure is likely ill-fated. Rauner already vetoed a similar measure lawmakers approved during the previous General Assembly session that ended in January, and he's expected to reject the latest measure as he presses for a broader statewide pension overhaul. "We will work with you and your priorities, as long as you work with us an our priorities," said House Republican Leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs. "Sure, I am concerned about Chicago's systems. But I am more concerned about Illinois' systems, our five systems, and no one on that side of the aisle seems concerned with it." Sponsoring Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago, said lawmakers had many problems to tackle but should not leave workers "in the lurch" in the meantime. "This is a very important solution to a very important problem," said Currie, the House majority leader. The legislation pushed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel is aimed at preventing retirement systems for municipal workers and laborers from going broke in about a decade. The two funds are a combined $21 billion short of what's needed to pay out future benefits, and the plan relies on newly hired employees paying more toward their retirement House Democrats on Tuesday approved a controversial bill that would expand the availability of taxpayer-funded abortions in Illinois, putting Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the politically difficult spot of following through on his pledge to veto it. The 62-55 vote came amid the fanfare of a women's... House Democrats on Tuesday approved a controversial bill that would expand the availability of taxpayer-funded abortions in Illinois, putting Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the politically difficult spot of following through on his pledge to veto it. The 62-55 vote came amid the fanfare of a women's... The latest version was sent to Rauner's desk on a 63-45 vote. Supporters would need 71 votes to override a potential veto, an unlikely threshold given Democrats control 67 votes and Republicans are reluctant to buck their governor. The Senate approved the bill earlier this year. Under the proposal, newly hired employees would start paying 11.5 percent of their salaries toward their retirement, which is 3 percent more than current employees. In later years, that amount could be reduced if an independent number cruncher agreed that less was needed to meet the city's goal of having 90 percent of the assets needed to pay benefits over the next 40 years. Employees hired from 2011 to 2016 already receive lower retirement benefits, and would have the option of increasing their contributions to 11.5 percent. In exchange, they would be eligible to retire at age 65 instead of 67. Employees hired before 2011 would see no changes. The Chicago City Council already did much of the heavy lifting by voting last year to approve a new tax on city water and sewer service that will top 30 percent by 2020. At that point, the new tax is expected to raise $239 million a year for the municipal fund. In 2014, aldermen raised the fee for emergency services on all landline and cellphones billed to city addresses by $16.80 a year to raise about $40 million annually that will be pumped into the laborers fund. Even with the already enacted tax and fee increases, the city in 2023 would have to come up with at least $278 million more a year to meet the pension funding requirements in the bill. That led Rep. Jeanne Ives, R-Wheaton, to compare the proposal to a "Ponzi scheme," saying taxpayers will be on the hook for more in the future. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com Twitter @moniquegarcia

Major associations representing physicians, hospitals, insurers and seniors all leveled sharp attacks against the House GOP's plan to rewrite the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, as some Republicans publicly questioned whether the measure can clear the House of Representatives. While industry groups warned that the proposal could leave vulnerable Americans with fewer protections than they now have, GOP leaders pressed ahead, bringing legislation before two key committees that are expected to approve the bills by week's end. They were also working in concert with the White House to win over conservatives, who have complained that the proposal preserves too much of the current law. The flurry of activity — including an evening meeting between President Donald Trump and leaders from five skeptical conservative groups — created new uncertainty about the viability of Republicans' signature promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The day's events also showed the uneasy predicament facing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the proposal's chief booster, who described the plan Wednesday as a "conservative wish list" that would deliver on years of GOP campaign promises to change the nation's health-care system. "Right now I feel confident saying there aren't 218 votes for this," said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who was referring to the number of votes needed to pass the measure out of the House. Perry opposes the proposal. The barrage of criticism shows how fraught the terrain of health-care policy is. It also reflects a backlash prompted at least partly by the breakneck speed with which House Republicans are trying to push through their proposal — with little upfront effort to work with interest groups or political factions. "What we're seeing now is that the political prospects for repealing the Affordable Care Act are as daunting as the effort to pass national health reform," Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs, said in an interview. President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... President Donald Trump offered his unqualified support for the health care alternative that House Republicans announced Tuesday. "I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives," he told GOP lawmakers a few hours after he tweeted about "our wonderful new Healthcare... House Republican leaders have given little indication that they will make anything but marginal changes to their plan, which would eliminate the requirements that all Americans obtain coverage or pay a tax penalty and that businesses with at least 50 employees provide insurance. The American Health Care Act would replace income-based subsidies with refundable tax credits based on age and income, charge individuals a 30 percent surcharge if they buy a plan after allowing their coverage to lapse and phase out the law's more generous Medicaid funding over time. While conservatives complained that these changes don't go far enough, they have sparked criticism not just from Democrats but from moderate Republicans, AARP, the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association. "We cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations," James Madara, chief executive of the American Medical Association and a doctor, wrote in a letter to committee leaders overseeing work on the bill. Richard Pollack, CEO of the American Hospital Association, voiced similar fears, saying efforts to "restructure the Medicaid program" by shifting it from an entitlement program to one based on a per capita allocation "will have the effect of making significant reductions in a program that provides services for our most vulnerable populations and already pays providers significantly less than the cost of providing care." America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest trade association, sent a letter Wednesday saying that while it appreciated several of the proposed changes, the changes to Medicaid "could result in unnecessary disruptions in the coverage and care beneficiaries depend on." House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., told reporters Wednesday that critics were exaggerating the proposal's potential repercussions. Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it.

Republican efforts to revise the Affordable Care Act met with widespread resistance Tuesday from conservatives in and out of Congress, moderates in the Senate and key industry stakeholders, casting doubt on the plan's chances just one day after House GOP leaders released it. The most imminent and... "It's tough to do entitlement reform, it's tough to make these changes, but I think at the end of day, seniors are going to be fine," Walden said. "If you're on Medicaid today, you'll be on Medicaid tomorrow. States can intercede here and help out. So there's more to this story." Walden said it was "sort of shocking" that hospital groups were strongly opposing the plan, because the GOP legislation restores the ACA's cuts to "disproportionate share" payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of uninsured patients. "There's a pretty big medical-industrial complex in America," he added. "And when you touch it, I've discovered, it touches back." House Republicans' determination to deliver on their promise to undo the ACA — Ryan said Wednesday that it is "the covenant we made with the American people when we ran on a repeal-and-replace plan in 2016" — has spurred a legislative drive that is happening at warp speed. A cadre of lawmakers and staffers worked behind closed doors for several weeks to draft the pair of bills, which were designed to move through the annual budget process in order to clear the Senate with a simple majority vote. But that process, which did not involve an extended period of negotiation with interest groups or consultation with Democrats, has produced a furious backlash. Some insurers, including Molina Healthcare and the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said they did not get to offer any input into the House proposal. "It doesn't seem like the industry got any heads-up or was involved. We definitely were not," Sunny Yu, spokeswoman for Molina Healthcare, which has about a million members in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, said in an email. Democrats threw up procedural obstacles Wednesday in the committee meetings and on the House floor, complaining that it was irresponsible to consider the bills before the Congressional Budget Office offered an analysis that showed the legislation's impact on the budget and Americans' overall health care coverage. "We need to know, what this is going to cost?" asked Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. "We need to know, what kind of health insurance is going to be feasible?" Both House Republicans and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney have predicted that they will have a CBO "score" ready by early next week, before the bills are combined and brought before the House Budget Committee. GOP staffers noted that other health care bills, including the 21st Century Cures Act and the 2015 reauthorization bill for Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program, began their journeys through congressional committees without a CBO score. Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee moved to delay the bill's consideration for 30 days, while those on Ways and Means moved to delay it for one week to allow for further hearings and to examine the CBO report. Both motions were voted down on a straight party-line vote, and the panels continued working into the evening. Still, the most imminent threat GOP leaders must contend with comes from the far right. The speaker can lose only 21 Republican votes if the American Health Care Act is to pass, and opponents are promising to use that leverage to force changes to the bill. Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va., a freshman member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he was confident that his camp could help reshape the legislation. While Trump had endorsed it already, Garrett said, he would probably be willing to accept something else if it were changed in a way conservatives could support. "This is a guy who said he wasn't sure that NATO, in its classic role, is necessary — and then two months later we saw countries like Germany vow to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP," said Garrett. "Why'd they do that? Because Donald Trump wasn't going to accept the status quo. They made a counteroffer. Right now, there's an offer, and he's saying he likes to get people to make counteroffers."

House GOP leadership faced mounting opposition Tuesday after introducing an Obamacare repeal and replace bill that was rejected by small government conservatives, panned by Republican moderates and given only lukewarm support from President Trump. One day after unveiling the GOP’s long-promised... Vice President Mike Pence met with two House Freedom Caucus leaders Tuesday, and that same day Mulvaney — a former caucus member — spent more than an hour at a meeting of the group. Its members have been invited to visit the White House next Tuesday. Wednesday night, Trump met with leaders from Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, the Heritage Foundation and its political arm, Heritage Action, and the Tea Party Patriots. But the hard reality for Republicans is that any changes made to appease House conservatives could threaten the bill's support among moderates. "My fear is that the bill will go backwards," said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group who has gotten White House attention of his own: He met Tuesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. "If the bill starts going in the reverse direction in order to satisfy certain members of my party, then I'm going to have a problem. I think the federal government has a role to play here, and I'm not looking to just see the federal government undermine the health care needs of the American people." Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a pivotal Republican moderate, said in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo News' Katie Couric that the current House measure would "not be well received in the Senate" and stood no chance of passing as is. "I want us to slow down to take more time to be sure we get this right." The Washington Post's David Weigel, Carolyn Johnson, Elise Viebeck and Amy Goldstein contributed.
