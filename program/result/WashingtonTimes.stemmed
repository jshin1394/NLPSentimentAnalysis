up

thursday
when
ask

had
someth
posit
to
say
about
the
presid
first
100

the
california
democrat
instead
talk
about
mr

use
of

i
was
think
he
was
more
of
a
creatur
that
stalk
the
night
that
these

just
came
out
at

like
a
vampir
that
he
tweet
these

mrs

said
but
now
it
spread
to
the
morn
so
let
me
think
for
a
while
democrat
came
out
on
the
lose
end
of
the

elect
cede
control
of
the
white

and
fail
to
win
the

or
the

—
the
latter
of
which
had
seem
within
reach
in
the
wane
day
of

as
they
pick
up
the

democrat
have
conclud
that
their
path
back
to

reli
not
on
find
common
ground
but
rather
on
fight
mr

at
everi
turn
save
for
the
few
issu
where
he
agre
with
them
i
think
our
caucus
and
the
parti
as
a
whole
after
the

and
the
loss
to

went
through
a
whole
defin

what

is
that
at

in
this

now
in

i
see
more

than
i

someth
monday
i
have
long
advoc
he
met
with
a
small
group
of
conserv

pundit
and
radio
talk
show
host
i
was
among
them
after
tick
off
a
list
of
what
he
said
were
his
accomplish
lead
up
to
the
arbitrari
100day
marker
of
his

we
ask
him
question
what
differ
from
the
crowd
of
liber
journalist
who
ask
question
dure
formal
news
confer
—
and
those
who
toss
question
at
his
spokesman
sean
spicer
at
the
daili
press
brief
—
is
that
our
group
ask
question
with
the
intent
of
get
inform
instead
of
the
accusatori
tone
and
gotcha
question
that
often
character
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
mainstream
media
the
session
was
suppos
to
be
on
background
mean
the
presid
could
not
be
quot
but
halfway
through
he
declar
it
on
the
record
which
is
how
news
broke
of
his
decis
to
impos
a
20
percent
tariff
on
canadian
lumber
enter
the
unit
state
mr
trump
said
it
is
unfair
for
the
canadian
lumber
industri
to
receiv
govern
subsidi
reciproc
he
call
it
a

i
like
the
question
were
substant
includ
mine
about
north
korea
given
your
state
bud
friendship
with
china
presid
xi

and
what
you
say
are
his
effort
to
dissuad
north
korea
nuclear
program
would
you
say
war
is
less
like
or
about
as
like
the
presid
said
he
doesn't
discuss
militari
matter
in
public
but
in
his
answer
to
my
followup
question
he
said
he
not
sure
some
of
the
armament
recent
parad
through
the
street
of
pyongyang
are
real
but
we'll
see
conserv
should
not
be
lapdog
for
a
republican
presid
no
one
ask
the
type
of
softbal
question
the
media
usual
toss
at
a
democrat
presid
the
presid
told
us
he
doesn't
expect
to
be
free
of
critic
but
appreci
fair
he
allow
that
conserv
journalist
are
like
to
be
fairer
to
him
than
those
his
strategist
steve
bannon
has
call
the
enemi

mr

stood

the

happili
the

for

this
week
the
high
drama
over
pass
a

pass
spend
bill
under
regular
order
and
the
lift
of
the
debt
ceil
has
gone
on
for
far
too
mani
year
congress
and
the
white

should
be
abl
to
at
least
complet
the
basic
of
govern
smooth
or
be
forc
to
do
so
by
risk
of
a

penalti
or
fine
the
three
trigger
for

member
of
congress
should
be
relat
to
the
three
most
basic
part
of
their
job
—
pass
a
budget
fund
the
feder
govern
under

and
manag
the
debt
status
of

unit
state
the
person
fine
on
member

congress
would
have
to
be
veri
sever
and
must
be
immedi
make
member
of
congress
cut
their
own
wrist
befor
they
pull
the
life
support
from
the
american
peopl
by
not
pass
critic
legisl
when
due
i
strong
believ
they
will
rush
to
find
common
ground
at
least
among
their
own
parti
member
ignor
those
who
are
hopeless
oppos
to
do
so
and
pass
aforement
legisl
on
time
it
must
not
wait
until
elect
day
the
record
would
show
that
the
vast
major
of
the
member
of
congress
do
not
fear
elect
with
mani
not
have
a
serious
challeng
in
decad
and
other
could
not
be
beaten
by
mother
teresa
if
she
regist
with
the
opposit
parti
due
to
polit
gerrymand
and
histor
trend
the
american
peopl
want
our
congress
to
do
it
job
and
that
take
535
member
and
the
white
hous
work
togeth
i
was
an
elect
offici
for
more
than
a
decad
with
most
of
that
time
as
a
member
of
congress
from
the
great
state
of
connecticut
i'm
republican
—
and
i
go
way
back
i
can
rememb
meet
presid
reagan
in
the
white
hous
as
an
elect
offici
i
was
the
first
black
conserv
elect
to
congress
and
i
was
the
first
black
republican
elect
to
the
hous
of
repres
in
near
60
year
back
in
1990
it
is
my
belief
that
the
most
skill
member
of
congress
are
the
one
who
are
abl
to
work
with
other
member
to
help
their
constitu
state
and
nation
voter
can
onli
reward
you
so
much
for
tri
and
fail
—
and
today
republican
control
the

senat
and
white

there
are
no
excus
achiev
are
what
warrant
prais
give
your

fals
expect
or
overpromis
would
slowli
come
to
an
end
everyon
understand
that
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
it
often
take
small
step
to
truli
make
a
posit
differ
the
more
step
taken
the
closer
you
get
to
your
goal
it
took
a
while
for
congress
to
get
to
this
point
elimin
earmark
strip
the
parti
leadership
of
a
larg
amount
of
it
strength
the
expand
use
of
gerrymand
in
congression
district
creat
more
polar
and
has
made
it
veri
difficult
to
beat
an

thus
there
are
littl
consequ
for
a
person
action
on
the
rare
occas
when
a

is
defeat
they
are
frequent
replac
with
a

more

noth
is
not
an

that
is
whi
the
approv
rate
for

have
been
so
low
over
the

we
should
fine
all
the
member

congress
and
the

if
they
are
unabl
to
do
the
basic
part
of
their
aforement

and
elimin

anywher
anytim
threat
of

we
would
have
a

feder

it
would
onli
take

chang
how
hefti
should

how
should
it
be
done

after
all
some

multimillionair

a

too
small
would
caus
them

on

some

and
you
do
not
want

is
to

nixon
won
over
a

northern

that

such
as

—
again
with
help
from
wallac
who
appeal
to
fedup
workingclass
democrat
what
was
the
lesson
from

the

could
have
recalibr

to
appeal
more
to

they

also
trick
democrat
into
wrong
think
that
most
new

were

and
would

so
the

in

foolish
nomin

prove

becaus

never
follow
the

trajectori
of

democrat
would
remain

1980
when

bernard

are
admit
in
public
that
the
parti
is
in
troubl
on
cbs
face
the
nation
mr
sander
was
blunt
well
i
think
what
is
clear
to
anyon
who
look
at
where
the
democrat
parti
today
is
that
the
model
of
the
democrat
parti
is
fail
he
told
host
john
dickerson
clear
the
democrat
parti
has
got
to
chang
and
in
my
view
what
it
has
got
to
becom
is
a
grassroot
parti
a
parti
which
make
decis
from
the
bottom
on
up
a
parti
which
is
more
depend
on
small
donat
than
larg
donat
a
parti
john
that
speak
to
the
pain
of
the
work
class
in
this
countri
fascin
mr
sander
recogn
it
the
parti
itself
that
is
the
problem
but
then
inexplic
goe
on
about
chang
the
decisionmak
process
and
how
they
get
their
money
still
refus
to
admit
that
after
eight
year
we
didn't
want
ani
more
of
what
liber
were
sell
the
democrat
problem
isn't
cosmet
rearrang
the
deck
chair
on
the
titan
wouldn't
have
kept
her
from
sink
mr
sander
comment
offer
up
a
shock
revel
the
democrat
still
don't
understand
what
happen
in
2016
and
they
have
no
idea
how
to
adapt
the
issu
isn't
about
bottom
up
decisionmak
it
the
fact
that
they
can't
even
begin
to
address
the
econom
and
nation
secur
issu
that
matter
most
to
american
mr
sander
pander
about
their
parti
need
to
speak
to
the
pain
of
the
work
class
of
the
countri
is
also
an
insult
it
was
the
democrat
parti
and
thenpresid
barack
obama
that
inflict
that
pain
on
everi
class
of
american
and
yet
here
is
uncl
berni
tri
to
pretend
the

he
blame
barack

he
note
barack

given
that
we
lost

lot
of
statehous
seat
governorship
secretari
of

his
true

is
in

i
think

loss
…
he
realli
good

your

ouch
final
someon

admit
the
obvious
even
if

state
mr

destroy

this
is
so
obvious
josh
earnest
mr

former

secretari
and
now
a

at

said
this
what
deputi
chairman
ellison
just
said
is
true
barack
obama
didn't
run
to
be
a
parti
leader
he
ran
to
be
presid
of
the
unit
state
but
then
mr
earnest
admit
this
disast
was
on
mr
obama
mind
becaus
there
are
consequ
for
this
deterior
of
democrat
strength
all
across
the
countri
for

legaci
this
was
a
perfect
summat
of
the
inept
malevol
of
mr

the
man
his

sycoph
admit
that
onli
mr

in

to

he
may
have
damag

mr

this
is
one
of
the
few
thing
they'v
done
in

area
that
i
total
agre
with

mr

said
that
whi
i
think
it
is
absolut
imper
that
obama
show
some
backbon
and
take
this
step
and
do
it
in
a
way
that
leav
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
chines
that
we'r
upset
with
what
they'v
done
we'v
let
china
get
away
with
so
much
this
is
kind
of
an
inexpens
way
of
convey
a
messag
to
china
mr

said
his
decis
to
lift
the
ban
on
arm
sale
was
not
base
on
china
although
he
ad
that
he
want
to
help
vietnam
improv
their
maritim
secur
postur
my
decis
to
lift
the
ban
realli
was
more
reflect
of
the
chang
natur
of
the
relationship
the
presid
said
monday
given
all
the
work
we
do
togeth
across
the
spectrum
of
econom
trade
secur
and
humanitarian
effort
that
it
was
appropri
for

not
to
have

at

who
serv
as

arizona
republican
mr

said
the
antivietnam
sentiment
in
congress
has
fade
it
no
longer
the
polit
obstacl
that
it
was
even
10
or
15
year
ago
he
said
the
general
sentiment
on
capitol
hill
has
been
as
long
as
vietnam
is
move
in
the
right
direct
—
even
rather
gradual
toward
open
up
the
polit
space
and
the
religi
freedom
space
and
the
rule
of

—
then
we
want
to
have
an
increas
close
relationship
at
the

time
on

defens
side
of
thing
i
don't
think
that
you

you
shouldn't

be
an

patsi
for
the

in

both
of

was

to

just
befor

conclud
that

determin
that
we
want
to
do
the
same
thing
those
guy
did
to
us
two
year
ago
wall
said
me
and
brad
led
the
way
we
lock
in
our
teammat
understood
what
we
had
to
do
we
didn't
want
to
have
a
game
7
boston
present
a
more
defens
firm
backcourt
than
atlanta
did
averi
bradley
and
marcus
smart
are
bigger
more
interest
in
defens
and
simpli
better
at
it
than
the
hawk
duo
of
denni
schroder
and
tim
hardaway
jr
instead
of
face
guy
who
are
work
toward
be
twoway
player
wall
and
beal
will
be
challeng
by
two
of
the
best
perimet
defend
in
the
leagu
the
wrinkl
in
that
mix
is
isaiah
thoma
boston
small
shifti
scorefirst
point
guard
who
has
work
his
way
from
mr
irrelev
as
the
final
pick
of
the
2011
draft
to
a
twotim
allstar
and
soul
of
the
celtic
tragedi
enter
thoma
life
at
the
start
of
the
playoff
when
his
sister
chyna
was

accid
in

of
feder
way
wash
—
a
short
trip
outsid
of
their

—
just
befor
the
postseason
began
he
play
through
tear
to
start
the
seri
friday
night
he
left
from
chicago
to
attend
his
sister
funer
saturday
chyna
would
have
been
23
year
old
next
week
thoma
is
list
as
5
foot
9
and
in
the
past
has
joke
there
should
be
an
extra
quarter
inch
on
that
measur
though
realiti
indic
the
69
inch
may
be
generous
to
begin
with
his
size
is
a
prolif
benefit
and
detriment
thoma
has
long
use
thought
about
what
he
can't
do
often
predic
on
his
height
as
motiv
to
turn
into
an
unlik
allstar
but
his
height
is
a
defens
issu
in
the
nba
and
leav
boston
coach
brad
steven
with
a
decis
in
the
final
game
against
chicago
boston
start
thoma
bradley
gerald
green
crowder
and
al
horford
crowder
is
a
6foot6
power
forward
in
that
align
as
stern
as
he
may
be
play
against
6foot10
markieff
morri
would
be
a
chore
for
crowder
which
mean
amir
johnson
who
was
bench
in
the
celtic
firstround
seri
could
be
back
in
the
mix
start
thoma
and
bradley
in
the
backcourt
mean
thoma
need
to
guard
wall
beal
or
possibl
otto
porter
if
thoma
is
on
porter
bradley
can
move
to
either
wall
or
beal
and
defend
them
along
with
crowder
becaus
of
injuri
throughout
the
season
boston
never
present
the
same
start
lineup
against

twice
in

meet
the
most

jona

right

at

he
is

especi
abl
as

he
perform
well
in
the
red

and
on
underneath

in

i
would
say
it
was
definit
the
most
improv
part
of
my
game
over
my
career
as
far
as
develop
as
a
tight

sprinkl
said
of
his
inlin
block
this
past
season
just
be
abl
to
be
those
gap
scheme
and
everyth
like
that
it
realli
gave
me
an
opportun
to
show
that
my
inlin
block
was
good
so
i
feel
like
that
part
of
my

is
good
and
solid
sprinkl

the

would
provid
him

and
a
safer
path
to

for
two
week
straight
she
burst
into
tear
tell
him
so
everi
night
until
jalen
gave

jalen
broke
up
33

in

twice
in

jalen
total
eight

a

of

instinct
and
vision
scout
love
about
him
most
project
have
him
go
in
the
second
or
third
round
of
the
draft
jalen
had
been
seen
as
a
firstround
potenti
even
a
top10
pick
befor
he
ran
a
462
40yard
dash
at
the
nfl
scout
combin
and
follow
it
up
with
an
even
slower
time
at

—
the
one

belichick
ditch
the

annual
meet
to
attend
jalen
say
a
sore
hamstr
impact
his
time
the
whole
famili
told
him
not
to
run

jalen
did
anyway
it
a
toss22
merri
said
do

merri
say
and
they'v

assur
repeat
that

more
import
than
his

jalen
would
love
to
be
draft
by
the
dalla
cowboy
he
say
he
love
the
redskin
but
think

jalen
will
watch
the
draft
from
home
with
his
mom
stepdad
girlfriend
and
mayb
a
few
friend
for
a
guy
that
doesn't
mind
the
spotlight
he
doesn't
want
to
make
a
big
deal
out
of
the

this
has
been
a
tax
process
we
just
tri
not
to
think
about
it
there
so
much
scrutini
in
the

these
day
it
so
mani
negat

he
has
a
sens
of

present
his

anticip
taxreform
scheme
wednesday
and
the
review
were
as
expect
mix
but
hope
clear
we
have
a
uniqu
opportun
to
do
someth
major
here
said
gari
cohn
director
of
the
presid
nation
econom
council
it
our
intent
to
creat
a
huge
tax
cut
and
equal
as
import
a
huge
simplif
of
the
tax
system
in
america
the
presid
would
slash
tax
rate
on
busi
and
make
major
chang
to
rate
for
individu
some
of
them
sure
to
rais
the
usual
howl
and
squeal
but
the
result
would
be
real
reform
of
a
tax
system
that
jimmi
carter
famous
call
a
disgrac
to
the
human

dog

didn't

it
either
the

larg
reflect

there

object
would
repeal
provis
enabl
individu
taxpay
to
deduct
state
and
local
tax
from
report
incom
on
which
they
pay
feder
incom
tax
this
would
particular
hurt
taxpay
in
hightax
state
like
new
york
california
and
new

the
trump
propos
would
impos
a
top
tax
rate
of
35
percent
on
individu
down
from
396
percent
at
present
but
more
than
the
33
percent
he
propos
on
the

a

deduct
for

would
be
doubl
but
deduct
except
for

and
charit
contribut
includ
those
to
religi

would
be
elimin
presid

argu
that

is
hard
to
get
to
and
they
couldn't
get
there
say
steven

of

and
that
whi
we
got
this

if
there
had
been
a
3
percent
growth
mayb
there
would
have
been
a
differ

the

that

we'r
go

there
clear

there
come

adm
donegan
said
the
deploy

mean
that
suicid
bomber
are
not
need
for

there
are
certain
terrorist
that
do
thing
and
they
get
martyr
to
go
and
do
it
he
said
but
there
are
mani
other
that
don't
want
to
martyr
themselv
in
make
attack
like
that
and
that
pretti
much
where
the
houthi
are
so
it
make
that
kind
of
weaponri
which
would
normal
take
someon
suicid
to

now
abl
to
be
use
by

not

themselv

the

are
suppli
the
houthi
with
ballist
missil
of
increas
rang
of
the

boat
adm
donegan
said
my
fear
is
they
move
to
use
that
weapon
against
ani
kind
of
commerc
that
flow
through
the
southern
red
sea
and
even
if
they
don't
intend
to
my
fear
is
that
it
becom
a
collater
damag
becaus
they'r
not
so
good
at
identifi
target
and
thing
like
that
with
about
64
vessel
a

travel
through
there
the
bab
almandeb
almost
all
with
energi
cargo
ani
issu
of
misidentif
or
misappl
of
one
of
these
weapon
system
could
becom
an
issu
with
commerc
and
that
what
we
have
to
avoid
in
the
end
what
we'd
like
to
see
is
that
conflict
back
into
the
land
mass
and
not
out
into
where
we
have
commerci
traffic
he
said
control
over
the
bab
almandeb
could
be
use
to
threaten
the
fragil
egyptian
economi
by
attack
ship
up
the
red

he
ad
also
ani
restrict

who
allow

not
at
all
the
outrag
was
against
the
littl
leaker
mr
snowden
the
outrag
was
so
intens
and
so
univers
that
mr
snowden
was
forc
into
exil
but
sure
the
primari
sin
was
the
work
or
lack

perform
by
our
esteem
intellig
communiti
whose
respons
it
is
to
guard
the
nation
secret
against

but
they
couldn't
even
stop
a

the
next
big

was
at

of
anoth
young
american
a

man
who
perpetr

so
who

what
about
those
senior

up

down

of

whose
incompet
allow
such
a
thing
to
happen
not
one
was
ever
even
accus
let
alon
indict
of
treason
or
even
derelict
of
duti
no
wonder
there
have
been
further
violat
of
our
nation
secur
this
time
2017
there
is
a
casual
admiss
by
the
fbi
and
the
rest
of
the
intellig
communiti
that
the
russian
have
systemat
hack
into
our
nation
secur
data
–
although
no
public
evid
has
been
produc
to
that
effect
all
the
washington
wonk
are
assum
that
the
purpos
of
this
intrus
was
to
trifl
with
the
american
elect
interest
that
charg
seem
to
assum
that
wikileak
obtain
the
podesta
email
from
the
russian
and
use
it
to
damag
the
hillari
clinton
campaign
in
the
absenc
of
compel
evid
to
the
contrari
this
assumpt
is
so
much
poppycock
in
the
first
place
mr
assang
himself
maintain
that
the
data
were
obtain
from
a
disgruntl
clinton
campaign
worker
second
this
is
not
a
farfetch
claim
base
on
the
ident
and
type
of
littl
guy
who
pull
off
much
greater
and
more
damag
disclosur
in
the
past
third
the
disclosur
were
true
no
one
has
ever
deni
the
authent
of
the
materi
damn
as
it
was
to
mrs
clinton
herself
so
this
whole
hous
is
built
upon
sand
–
there
is
noth
there
but
the
angri
muse
of
a
defeat
campaign
tri
desper
to
blame
someon
els
for
their

but
what
about
the

which

we
be

the

coalit
of

and
idea
that

is
a
third
faction
led
by

who
push
the
kind
of
populist
america
first
approach
that
got
mr

elect
at

end
of

the

will
remind

remind
his

that

the

some

is
an
inevit
result
of

the

voic
was
the

voic
in

mr

said
it
less
effect
if
one
want
to
be
the

in
a
complex

the
elev
of
the

who
want

happen
pretti

mr

said
those
are
fundament
contradictori
idea
so
he
ran
on

now
is

signal
that
he

it
a

it

actual
solv

on

from

the

would
the
prospect
of
an

actual
take

secur
seem
too
much
for
the

to
take
after

appeas
and

have
an

in

seem
to
be
the

prefer

britain
prime

i
think
what
is
crucial

and
where
we
have
been
work
and
will
continu
to
work
through
the
unit
nation
secur
council
through
resolut
which
we
have
support
there
and
with
the
unit
state

is
to
encourag
china
to
look
at
this
issu
of
north
korea
and
to
play
a
more
signific
role
in
term
of
north

she
said
i
think
that
where
our
attent
should
focus
report
the
telegraph
former
us
secretari
of
defens
ash
carter
said
this
on
the
sunday
news
circuit
a

with

would
lead
to
an
intens
of
violenc
not
seen
sinc
the

that
may
be
true
howev

chief

woolsey
recent
state
that

emp
nuclear

expend

would

wipe

grid
and

i
guess
our

would
prefer

over

about

a

of

this

is
not

local
around

as
in

when

have
been
hollow
out

from
within
sixteen

the

elect
took

in
a

where
the

both

for

even

analysisopinion
after
a
year
or
so
follow
the
entri
into
forc
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
it
is
possibl
to
draw
some
conclus
about
the
controversi
agreement
and
arm
control
in
general
first
despit
the
isra
govern
strong
opposit
to
the
deal
and
the
heat
debat
it
generat
in

congress
it
has
becom
increas
clear
that
there
was
never
ani
real
altern
to
the
arrang
with
the
obama
administr
under
pressur
from
israel
the
congression
republican
could
have
held
out
for
more
farreach
constraint
on
iran
nuclear
bombmak
capabl
but
this
step
would
have
been
strong
oppos
by
the
other
particip
in
the
negoti
—
russia
china
germani
franc
and
britain
the
result
would
not
onli
have
been
a
negoti
stalem
but
the
rapid
eros
of
the
multilater
econom
sanction
that
brought
iran
to
the
tabl
in
the
first
place
under
these
circumst
iran
would
have
been
abl
to
freeli
proceed
with
it
develop
of
a
nuclear
weapon
the
other
altern
open
to
washington
would
have
been
to
undertak
perhap
with
the
assist
of
israel
a
militari
strike
against
iran
harden
and
decentr
nuclear
infrastructur
an
attack
that
would

requir
hundr

mission
in
the
light
of
today
turmoil
and
conflict
in
syria
iraq
libya
and
yemen
the
idea
of
an
americaniranian
war
seem
almost
unthink
a
second
conclus
is
that
had
the
unit
state
and
the
other
major
power
launch
their
negoti
effort
a
decad
or
so
earlier
it
probabl
would
have
been
possibl
to
reach
a

tend
to
ratifi
militari
fact
on
the
ground
they
reflect
but
do
not
fundament
alter
the
prevail
balanc
of
power
thus
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
reflect
the
fact
that
the
tehran
regim
spent
billion
over
20
year
to
develop
and
build
over
20000
centrifug
to
enrich
uranium
even
with
the
pressur
of
an
intern
sanction
regim
iran
was
not
prepar
to
destroy
these
centrifug
as
a
price
for
reach
agreement
but
in
2003
follow
the
american
invas
of
iraq
the
regim
signal
to
washington
that
it
was
prepar
to
enter
negoti
over
the
nuclear
issu
at
that
time
iran
possess
onli
a
few
hundr
centrifug
had
this
occur
there
was
the
real
possibl
that
an
accord
limit
iran
to
a
far
smaller
centrifug
could
be
reach
in
retrospect
the
failur
to
engag
earlier
with
iran
on
the
nuclear
issu
look
like
a
major
blunder
a
third
conclus
is
that
while
agreement
can
enhanc
stabil
and
predict
they
do
not
transform
polit
relationship
the
major
achiev
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
is
that
for
the
next
decad
or
so
we
can

that
even
the

of

also

a
more
posit
attitud
toward
the
autonom

region
govern
in
northern
iraq
within
the
past
few
year
this
favor
pictur
of
the
turkish
role
has
fallen
apart
larg
for
two
reason
one
is
the
increas
authoritarian
way
of
presid
recep
tayyip
erdogan
the
former
prime
minist
move
to
the
presid
with
the
intent
of
transform
that
offic
into
a
strong
execut
but
ani
such
constitut
chang
matter
less
now
than
a
disturb
eros
of
basic
civil
and
polit
right
the
press
is
be
muzzl
and
court
are
be
hobbl
the
latest
move
by
mr
erdogan
to
crush
ani
challeng
to
his
accumul
of
power
has
been
to
declar
a
former
alli
the
influenti
movement
led
by
exil
preacher
fethullah
gulen
to
be
a
terrorist
group
—
a
groundless
charg
the
other
major
reason
that
turkey
role
has
chang
has
been
the
civil
war
in
syria
on
turkey
southern
doorstep
the
fluctuat
relationship
between
ankara
and
the
assad
regim
in
damascus
has
settl
into
one
of
strong
antagon
with
mr
erdogan
determin
to
oppos
the
syrian
regim
get
in
the
way
of
effort
by
other
to
counter
the
socal
islam
state
or
isi
the
kurdish
problem
has
flare
anew
with
ankara
oppos
ani
cooper
with
a
kurdish
militia
in
syria
that
other
have
found
to
be
an
effect
oppon
to
islam
state
but
one
that
the
turkish
govern
consid
to
be
an
arm
of
a
rebelli
kurdish
group
in
turkey
the
effect
of
these
develop
on
turkey
relat
with
outsid
power
have
been
profound
and
uniform
negat
to
the
west
the
same
turkey
that
has
been
a
valu
partner
on
mani
diplomat
and
secur
matter
and
still
has
the
secondlargest
armi
in
nato
now
present
a
signific
human
right
problem
the
main
reason
western
relat
with
turkey
have
not
gotten
ani
wors
than
they
have
is
european
depend
on
turkey
in
stem
the
flow
of
migrant
from
the
middl
east
to
europ
the
downturn
in

relat
has
been
even
sharper
a
decad

that
relationship
was
warm

has
thrown

the
worst

when
turkey
shot

a
russian
warplan
that
had
flown
briefli
into

dure

a

my
tenur
as

point
that

rule
out
the
key
to

genuin

cooper
on

is
for
the

to
make
a

push
not

also
to

a

understand

howev

if

oh
and
it
a

too
so
a

is
not

the
fact
first
the

consid
legisl
that

such
as
those
that

a

for

the

titl
the

mean
that
if

300
speed

isn't
paid
within
the
30day
grace
period
and
is
paid
say
10

late
the

would
not
doubl
to

introduc
by

also
would
not

who

capit
for

tourist
who

themselv
or

would
not
be

either
for
sure
the
rollback
in

fine
is
a
poke
in

to
maryland
and
virginia
in
the

of

look
at
the

he
said
in

2016

with

i
think
when
you
do
that
as
a

and
say
how
much
of
our
ecclesiolog
is
realli
just
victorian
or
greek
rather
than

that
that
open
the
door
for
the

to
realli
start
step
toward

in
his

mr

suggest
that
regardless
of
one
race
the
christian
faith
teach
that
everyon
fundament
has
the

problem
and
need
the

savior
i
think
that
if
we
could
as

just
kind
of
like
just
kind
of

like
what
the

say
about

mr

about

that

–
from

that
if

this
was
the
virtu
of
these

cardin
martin
said
note
that
to
accept
death
rather
than
tell
a

is
more
heroic
than
mani
adult
there
a
lot
to
say
on
the
heroic
of
children
he
said
ad
that
becaus
of
this
i
brought

forward

also
the

the
visionari
had
spent
the
remaind
of
her
life
after
the

as
a
carmelit
nun
typic
there
must
be
a
fiveyear
wait
period
after

befor
their

can
be
brought
forward
howev
after
onli
three
year
martin
ask
that
the
remain
two
be
dismiss
and
his
request
was
grant
although
the
diocesan
phase
of
the
caus
has
alreadi
been
finish
cardin
martin
–
who
knew
the
visionari
person
–
said
lucia
process
will
take
much
longer
than
that
of
francisco
and
jacinta
not
onli
due
to
her
long
life
but
also
becaus
of
the
vast
number
of
letter
and
other
materi
from
her
write
and
correspond
that
need
to
be
examin
the
cardin
who
will
be
present
in

with
the
pope
dure
his
may
1213
visit
for
the
centenari
of

said
he
view
the
occas
as
the
conclus
of
a
process
that
began
with
him
chang
a
norm
regard
the
view
of
children
and
their
heroic
virtu
this
process
is
import
he
said
becaus
it
mean
there
could
be
other
children
who
practic
heroic
virtu
that
can
now
be
canon
so
it
certain
someth
import
it
need
to
be
seen
that
children
are
truli
capabl
of
practic
heroic
virtu
not
onli
in
fatima
but
in
the
christian
life

cardin

he
decid
to
chang
this
becaus
the

two
differ
realiti
while
the
canon
had
a
more
univers
dimens
of
the
church
the
beatif
have
a
more
local
dimens
where
they
the
bless
came
from
he
said
note
that
this
is
reflect
even
in
the
word
spoken
dure
the
rite
for
each
mass
becaus
of
this
i
made
a
distinct
the
beatif
in
their
the
bless
own
church
in

and
the

in

the
result
was
a

23000
peopl
would
particip
in
the
beatif
ceremoni
in

hundr

start
to

beauti
to
