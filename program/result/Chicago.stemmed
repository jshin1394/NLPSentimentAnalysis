all
came
to
a
head
fbi

jame

mike

testifi
befor
the
hous
intellig
committe
in
a
rare
public
hear
about
what
they
know
and
what
they
want
to
know
there
was
no
smoke
gun
from
either
side
perspect
but
we
did
learn
more
about
what
the
fbi
is
investig
and
what
republican
and
democrat
in
congress
want
to
investig
below
are
six
takeaway
from
the
hear
1
there
no
evid
of
presid
donald
trump
accus
that
obama
tap
his
phone
comey
quick
confirm
where
the
last
few
week
seem
to
have
been
lead
there
is
no
evid
to
back
up
trump
claim
that
obama
order
wiretap
of
his
trump
tower
phone
i
have
no
inform
that
support
those
tweet
comey
said
comey
clearasday
comment
make
it
imposs
for
trump
to
keep
say
he
was

possibl

associ
fbi
director
jame
b
comey
confirm
his
agenc
is
investig
possibl
cooper
between
russia
and
trump
campaign
associ
but
realli
the
whole
wiretap
thing
felt
like
a
sidebar
in
this
hear
to
the
fbis
broader
investig
into
russia
and
ani
trump
associ
tie
that
in
part
becaus
most
lawmak
feel
it
is
a
sidebar
to
the
real
issu
a
foreign
countri
interf
in
a
us
elect
with
the
intent
of
undermin
the
unit
state
polit
process
the
stake
are
noth
less
than
the
futur
of
our
democraci
and
liber
democraci
said
rep
adam
b
schiff
calif
the
top
democrat
on
the
committe
so
let
get
into
that
2
the
fbi
is
investig
connect
between
trump
campaign
associ
and
the
russian
govern
this
might
seem
to
be
an
obvious
takeaway
the
washington
post
and
other
news
organ
report
this
two
month
ago
but
member
of
congress
have
been
extrem
frustrat
that
until
monday
the
fbi
has
refus
to
privat
acknowledg
the
exist
of
an
investig
let
alon
what
it
is
look
into
the
fbi
rare
acknowledg
public
the
exist
of
an
ongo
investig
except
in
comey
word
in
unusu
circumst
this
appar
is
one
of
those
circumst
on
monday
comey
told
congress
and
the
world
that
yes
the
fbi
is
investig
russia
meddl
in
the
us
elect
in
addit
it
is
investig
whether
there
was
ani
coordin
between
the
trump
campaign
and
russia
and
whether
ani
crime
were
commit

but
the
fbi
is
go
to
be
veri
tightlip
about
the
investig
in
the
next
breath
comey
said
he
is
not
go
to
share
much
els
about
the
investig
other
than
it
exist
we
just
cannot
do
our
work
well
or
fair
if
we
start
talk
about
it
while

it
and
he
caution
congress

the
public
not
too
read
too
much
into
the

silenc
about

the

in

and
cloudi
claim
about

all
came
to
a
head
fbi
director
jame
b
comey
and
nation
secur
agenc
director
mike
roger
testifi
befor
the
hous
intellig

in
a
rare
public
hear
about
what
they
know
and
what
they
want
to
know
there
was
no
smoke
gun
from
either
side
perspect
but
we
did
learn
more
about
what
the
fbi
is
investig
and
what
republican
and
democrat
in
congress
want
to
investig
below
are
six
takeaway
from
the
hear
1
there
no
evid
of
presid
donald
trump
accus
that
obama
tap
his
phone
comey
quick
confirm
where
the
last
few
week
seem
to
have
been
lead
there
is
no
evid
to
back
up
trump
claim
that
obama
order
wiretap
of
his
trump
tower
phone
i
have
no
inform
that
support
those
tweet
comey
said
comey
clearasday

make
it
imposs
for
trump
to
keep
say
he
was

fbi
director
jame
b
comey
confirm
his
agenc
is
investig
possibl
cooper
between
russia
and
trump
campaign
associ
but
realli
the
whole
wiretap
thing
felt
like
a
sidebar
in
this
hear
to
the
fbis
broader
investig
into
russia
and
ani
trump
associ
tie
that
in
part
becaus
most
lawmak
feel
it
is
a
sidebar
to
the
real
issu
a
foreign
countri
interf
in
a
us
elect
with
the
intent
of
undermin
the
unit
state
polit
process
the
stake
are
noth
less
than
the
futur
of
our
democraci
and
liber
democraci
said
rep
adam
b
schiff
calif
the
top
democrat
on
the
committe
so
let
get
into
that
2
the
fbi
is
investig
connect
between
trump
campaign
associ
and
the
russian
govern
this
might
seem
to
be
an
obvious
takeaway
the
washington
post
and
other
news
organ
report
this
two
month
ago
but
member
of
congress
have
been
extrem
frustrat
that
until
monday
the
fbi
has
refus
to
privat
acknowledg
the
exist
of
an
investig
let
alon
what
it
is
look
into
the
fbi
rare
acknowledg
public
the
exist
of
an
ongo
investig
except
in
comey
word
in
unusu
circumst
this
appar
is
one
of
those
circumst
on
monday
comey
told
congress
and
the
world
that
yes
the
fbi
is
investig
russia
meddl
in
the
us
elect
in
addit
it
is
investig
whether
there
was
ani
coordin
between
the
trump
campaign
and
russia
and
whether
ani
crime
were
commit
3
but
the
fbi
is
go
to
be
veri
tightlip
about
the
investig
in
the
next
breath
comey
said
he
is
not
go
to
share
much
els
about
the
investig
other
than
it
exist
we
just
cannot
do
our
work
well
or
fair
if
we
start
talk
about
it
while
were
do
it
and
he
caution
congress
and
the
public
not
too
read
too
much
into
the
fbis
silenc
about
it
i
know
specul

of
human

but
it
realli
isnt
fair
to
draw
conclus
simpli
becaus
i

in

it

she

no

the

they

we

use

and
61

figur
the
figur
is
correct
but
it
requir
some
caveat
here
what
we
found
first
some
context
southwest
border
apprehens
have
steadili
declin
sinc
their
peak
at
more
than
16
million
peopl
in
fiscal
2000
there
have
been
temporari
spike
sinc
2000

most
recent
there
was
an
uptick
in
apprehens
of
unaccompani
children
and
their
famili
in
2016
after
a
signific
drop
in
2015
those
apprehens
in
2016
were
back
to
2014
level
dure
the
height
of
the
flow
of
central
american
migrant
illeg
cross
the
border
these
famili
and
children
are
flee
rampant
violenc
and
crime
in
a

call
the
northern

compris
guatemala
hondura
and
el

mani
of
the
central

migrant
turn
themselv
in
to

patrol
onc
they
reach
the
southwest

status
this
repres
a
shift
in
border
migrat
the
number
of
mexican
caught
tri
to
cross
the

illeg
is
drop
more
than
400000
in
fiscal
2010
to
about
177000
in
2016
the
washington
post
report
the
number
of
migrant
from
the
northern
triangl
near
quadrupl
in
the
same
period
to
almost
179000
march
2017
total
apprehens
were
inde
veri
low
it
the
lowest
month
number
cbp
has
report
sinc
at
least
2000
the
64
percent
figur
he
use
is
the
total
number
of
peopl
apprehend
or
deem
inadmiss
at
the
southwest
border
in
march
2017
16600
compar
to
the
total
number
in
march
2016
46150
the
61
percent
figur
trump
is
refer
to
is
the
drop
in
just
the
southwest
border
apprehens
from
januari
2017
31577
to
march
2017
12193
a
61
percent
drop
over
three
month
is
dramat
as
trump
indic
but
the
januari
data
is
a
total
for
the
month
not
sinc
inaugur
day
on
jan
20

so
the
major
of
the
month
data
predat
his
presid
actual
the
best
applestoappl
measur
would
be
to
compar
the
number
of
peopl
apprehend
or
deem
inadmiss
for
februari
and
march
of
2016
with
februari
and
march
of
2017
that
calcul
show
there
was
a
524
percent
40170
decreas
in
2017
compar
to
2016
84466
this
would
be
a
more
accur
look
at
the
impact
of
trump
polici
chang
to
date
rather
than
focus
on
just
the
month
of
march
still
expert
caution
against
put
too
much
emphasi
on
the
annual
quarter
or
month
number
becaus
immigr
trend
are
about
flow
not
raw
number
but
what
is
notabl
about
recent
apprehens
is
that
it
doesnt
fit
the
season
trend
usual
there
a
season
lull
through
winter
month
befor
apprehens
start
climb
back
up
apprehens
tend
to
peak
from
march
to
may
befor
come
back
down
in
the
late
summer
and
through
the
fall
but
in
fall
2016
there
was
an
increas
in
apprehens
despit
the
season
norm
you
can
see
this
increas
in
the
bright
blue
line
of
2016
apprehens
in
the
graphic
below
apprehens
start
to
increas
in
juli
2016
and
through
octob
see
the
red
line
for
fiscal
2017
and
peak
in
novemb
2016
then
apprehens
start
fall
from
novemb
to
march
look
at
the
red
line
in
the
graphic
it
clear
that
the
downward
trend
in
2017
so
far
is
differ
and
more
drastic
than
ani
other
year
sinc
2002
what
doe
this
all

whi
was
there

did
it

it

my

the

has
been

it
been
about

that
mean
it

in

thendh
secretari
jeh

declar
apprehens
were
at
record
low
becaus
of
measur
his

had
taken

respond
to
the

gave
him

time
as
weve
seen
the
central
american
crisi
continu
to
persist
lead
to
a
spike
in

the
follow
year
so
the
reduct
in

under

didnt
last
long
trump
is
cite
a
document
figur
that
the
total
number
of

declin

from

2017
the

show
how
uncharacterist
low
the

has
been

the

also

there

a

that
alreadi
global
bannon
said
at

in
2014
at
a
time
when
the

was
gain
territori
everi

that
we
refus
to

he
think
the

it
is
urgent
enough
to
take
prioriti
over

rivalri
and
worri
in
his
talk
at

bannon
was
ask
about
russian
presid
vladimir

bannon
answer
was
twosid
i
think
that
putin
and
his

are
realli
a
kleptocraci
that
are
realli
an
imperialist
power
that
want
to
expand

there
were
bigger
concern
than
russia

and
there
was
someth
to
admir
in
putin
call
for
more
tradit
valu
howev
i
realli
believ

im
not

bannon
own
comparison
to

thoma
cromwel
might
be

if

is
that

has
his

which
he
will
tri
to

not

he

obvious
he
will
feel
more
comfort
if
the

who

the

if

and
improv
public
school
particular
in

devo
has

there

janet
napolitano
if
there
had

so
my
question
is
is
there
a

on
that
popul
until
they
can
be
more
stringent
vet
to
ensur
that
were
not
let
into

countri
peopl
who
would
do
us
harm
napolitano
yep
let
me
if
i
might
answer
your
question
two
part
first
part
with
respect
to
the
56
57000
who
were
resettl
pursuant
to
the
origin
resettl
program
they
have
all
been
revet
against
all
of
the
dhs
databas
all
of
the
nctc
nation
counter
terror
center
databas
and
the
depart
of
defens
biometr
databas
and
so
that
work
has
not
been
done
and
focus
collin
that
complet
napolitano
that
is
complet
move
forward
no
one
will
be
resettl
without
go
through
the
same
sort
of
vet
now
i
dont
know
if
that
equat
to
a
hold
as
you
say
but
i
can
say
that
have
done
the
alreadi
resettl
popul
move
forward
they
will
all
be
review
against
those
kind
of
databas

the
new
rule
were
stringent
the
economist
report
and
it
result
in
some
turmoil
immigr

soon
began
recheck
all
iraqi

with

in

about

soontob

were
told
that
they
would
not

alreadi
book
some

thousand

when
the

must
now
pass

three
state

record
show
there
was

there
were
18251
in
2010
6339
in
2011
and
16369
in
2012
but
it
unclear
that
equat
to
an
actual
sixmonth
paus
in
visa
process
rather
than
a
dramat
slowdown
in
approv
as
new
rule
were
put
in

one
news
report
said
pace
of
visa
approv
have
slow
to
a

indic
some
were
still
be
approv
the
pinocchio
test
so
what
the
differ
with
trump
action
first
obama
respond
to
an
actual
threat

the
discoveri
that
two
iraqi
refuge
has
been
implic
in
bombmak
in
iraq
that
had
target
us
troop
under
congression
pressur
offici
decid
to
reexamin
all
previous
refuge
and
also
impos
new
screen
procedur
which
led
to
a
slowdown
in
process
new
applic
trump
by
contrast
issu
his
execut
order
without
ani
known
trigger
threat
second
obama
did
not
announc
there
was
a
ban
on
visa
applic
in
fact
as
seen
in
napolitano
answer
to
collin
administr
offici
danc
around
that
question
there
was
certain
a
lot
of
news
report
that
visa
applic
had
been
slow
to
a
trickl
but
the
obama
administr
never
said
it
was
their
polici
to
halt
all
applic
even
so
the
delay
did
not
go
unnot
so
there
was
a
lot
of
critic
news
report
at
the
time
about
the
angst
of
iraqi
wait
for
approv
third
obama
polici
did
not
prevent
all
citizen
of
that
countri
includ
green
card
holder
from
travel
the
unit
state
trump
polici
is
much
more
sweep
we
have
sought
comment
from
the
white

and
also
from
obama
administr
offici
and
so
may
updat
this
if
more
inform
becom

so
far
this
is
worthi
of
at

two
pinocchio

this
is
one
of

it
the
most

one
this

two

but
has
been
unabl
to

so
presum
other

have
tri
to

so
one
has
to

with
a
huge

of
skeptic
inde
the
new

report
befor

that
the

ultim
conclud

there
could
be
an
innocu
explan
like
a

email

for
the
comput

with
the
russian

interest
as
far
as
we
can
tell
onli
two
other
report
have
touch
on
this
fisa
claim
and
they
also
have
british
connect
one
is
a
report
in

which
the

also
cite
as
a

the

lawyer

was
reject
outright
by

they
return
with
a
more
narrowli
drawn

in

were
reject
again
final
befor
a

the

was
grant
on

octob
three

befor

neither

which

that
three

it
clear
this

he
said
final
there
was

that

incomplet
said

there
a

they
didnt

of

normal
done
there
room
for

some
democrat
have
call
for
more
of
the

to
suppli
their

said
that
in

as

administr
have
there
is
no

but
by

tradit
they

while
some

suggest
that
6

15

a

20

the

are
far
north
of

in

they

the

14

that
21

would

in

and
that

then
the

an

52

would
be
uninsur
compar

that

this

and
even
that
it
mere
a

as

it
one
thing
to
make
that

it
anoth
to
make
just
about
everi
republican

believ
it
as
ryan

it

anoth
to
get

they
know
could
be
dead
on
arriv
in
the

where
republican
have
just
52
vote
perhap
the
one
big
save
grace
for
the
gop
in
the
cbo

is
that
it
say
the

will
reduc
the

over
the
long

337

over
a
decad
that
no
small
number
and
as
ryan
note
in

the
report
also
say

begin

this

the

he

the

has
increas
coverag
by
20

to
22

almost
half

through

an

52

compar
with

under

obvious
we
want
to

those

number
said

when

some

are
go
to

account
for
the
immedi
increas
in
the

accord
to
the

eventu
mani
peopl
would
lose

insur
becaus
the

becaus

all

it

trump
plung
into
his
explan
of
the
polit
of
decid
to
call
off
a
vote
on
a

he
had
been
tout
the

to
blame
we
couldnt
get
one
democrat
vote
and
we
were
a
littl
bit
shi
veri

so
we
pull
it

he
would
not
put
the

in
the
come
week
he
is
will
to
wait
and
watch
the
current

continu
and
in
his
view
encount
problem
and
he
believ
that
democrat
eventu
will
want
to
work
with
him
on
some
kind
of
legisl
fix
to
obamacar
although
he
did
not
say
when
that
will
be
as
you
know
ive
been
say
for

unifi
deal
and

the
beauti
trump

a
100
percent
or
70
percent
that

fault
he
return
again
to
a
partisan
line
on
the
turn
of
event
to
be
honest
the
biggest
loser
today
are
nanci
pelosi
and
chuck
schumer
trump
said
of
the
hous
minor
leader
and
the
senat
minor
leader
becaus
now
they
own
the
disast
known
as
obamacar
okay
i
ask
they
may
own
it
in
his
view
but
he
will
at
some
point
be
task
with
shape
whatev
come
forward
as
a
partial
replac
what
will
that
be
what
kind
of
polici
could
he
support
oh
lot
of
thing
can
happen
trump
said
but
the
best
would
be
if
we
could
all
get
togeth
and
do
a
real
healthcar
bill
that
would
be
good
for
the
peopl
and
that
could
veri
well
happen
doe
trump
regret
start
his
agenda
this
year
with
health
care
no
i
dont
he
said
but
in
a
way
im
glad
i
got
it
out
of
the
way
look
im
a
team
player
trump
said
of
the
republican
parti
ive
play
this
team
ive
play
with
the
team
and
they
just
fell
a
littl
bit
short
and
it
veri
hard
when
you
need
almost
100
percent
of
the
vote
and
we
have
no
vote
zero
from
the
democrat
it
unheard
of
what
happen
with
the
hous
freedom
caucus
the
hardlin
conserv
he
had
woo
over
and
over
again
ah
that
the
big
question
trump
said
with
a
slight
chuckl
dont
know
i
have
a
good
relationship
with
them
but
i
couldnt
get
them
they
just
wouldnt
do
it
trump
allud
to
longrun
simmer
drama
on
capitol
hill
which
he
said
had
littl
to
do
with
him
as
a
reason
the
freedom
caucus
could
not
back
the
bill
year
of
hatr
and
distrust
he
said
long
befor
me
was
trump
say
perhap
that
the
inabl
of
ryan
and
his
team
to
work
well
with
that
caucus
was
part
of
whi
talk
stall
well
look
you
can
say
what
you
want
trump
said
but
there
are
year
of
problem
great
hatr
and
distrust
and
you
know
i
came
into
the
middl
of
it
i
think
they
made
a
mistak
but
that
okay
trump
said
of
the
freedom
caucus
as
we
wrap
up
i
tri
to
get
some
clariti
the
presid
was
blame
the
democrat
and
was
will
to
let
the
law
explod
yet
he
also
seem
to
be
teas
the
possibl
of
do
someth
bipartisan
down
the
road
a
fresh
start
at
some
point
i
ask
would
work
on
a
bipartisan
healthcar
deal
a
year
from
now
be
someth
he
would
find
more
agreeabl
than
whip
the
hard
right
a
lot
of
peopl

for

i
would

insist

the
comment
is
like
to

announc
last

that
the

would
demand
border
wall
fund
in

such
a

would
almost
certain
prompt

is
need
to

no

said
they
believ
trump
see
a

as
the
best
way
to
prove
that
his
most
controversi

can
be

mulvaney
said
friday
in

you
cannot
expect
a

who
just
won

a
plan
that

languish
for

amid
unrest
throughout
the
parti
as
the
presid
and
his
alli
court
member
and
push
for
a

befor
i
could
ask
a
question
trump
plung
into
his
explan
of
the
polit
of
decid
to
call
off
a
vote
on
a
bill
he
had
been
tout
the
democrat
he
said
were
to
blame
we
couldnt
get
one
democrat
vote
and
we
were
a
littl
bit
shi
veri
littl
but
it
was
still
a
littl
bit
shi
so
we
pull
it
trump

final
debat
on

american
health
care
act
legisl
that
aim
to
repeal
and
replac
the
afford
care
act
began
march
24
2017
but
the
bill
was
withdrawn
at
the
last
minut
ahead
of
a
vote
trump
said
he
would
not
put
the
bill
on
the
floor
in
the
come
week
he
is
will
to
wait
and
watch
the
current
law
continu
and
in
his
view
encount
problem
and
he
believ
that
democrat
eventu
will
want
to
work
with
him
on
some
kind
of
legisl
fix
to
obamacar
although
he
did
not
say
when
that
will
be
as
you
know
ive
been
say
for
year
that
the
best
thing
is
to
let
obamacar
explod
and
then
go
make
a
deal
with
the
democrat
and
have
one
unifi
deal
and
they
will
come
to
us

wont
have
to
come
to
them

said
after

explod
the
beauti
trump
continu
is

obamacar
so
when

replac
what

that
be
what
kind
of
polici
could
he

would
be
if
we

all
get
togeth

do
a
real
healthcar
bill
that
would
be
good
for

no
i
dont
he
said
but
in
a
way
im
glad
i
got

team
player
trump
said
of
the

parti
ive
play
this
team
ive
play
with
the
team
and
they
just
fell
a
littl
bit
short
and
it
veri
hard
when
you
need
almost
100
percent
of
the

and
we
have
no
vote
zero
from
the
democrat
it
unheard
of
what

with
the
hous
freedom

the
hardlin
conserv
he
had

the
big
question
trump

a
slight
chuckl
dont

i
couldnt
get

it
realli
start

to

when

if

becaus
of

to

that
a
veri
real

immedi
concern
instead
of

out

reli
on

that
includ
hundr

which
in

are

for

fisher
buy
special

the

collect
is
then
use
to

maintain

but
with
state

face
a
sever
cash
shortag
those
special

are
often
invit
target
for

look
to
keep

open

provid

that
particular
true
for

which
is
one
of
the

most
flush

becaus

and
sinc
that

usual
isnt

construct

it
has
all

to

again
—
make
it
seem
like
an

sourc
of

when
lawmak

the

turn
to

each

last

associ
what
that
realli
lead
us
to
is
a
boomandbust
cycl
and
that
is
an
ineffici
and
more
wast
way
of
do
it
take
money
from
the
gas
fund
at
a
time
when
the
gas
fund
get
less
money
is
a
doubl
whammi
when
transport
spend
alreadi
has
fallen
behind
the
state
wish
list
the
metropolitan
plan
council
estim
illinoi
must
pour
an
extra
43
billion
into
transport
dure
the
next
10
year
to
do
away
with
a
mainten
backlog
and
bring
road
bridg
and
highway
into
good
condit
illinoi
impos
a
base
tax
of
19
cent
per
gallon
for
gasolin
and
215
cent
a
gallon
for
diesel
though
other
fraction
of
a
penni
are
ad
on
to
pay
for
cost
associ
with
environment
cleanup
and
underground

storag
the
state
gas
tax
has
not
increas
sinc
1991
and
money
rais
has
remain
relat
flat
as
vehicl
becom
increas
fueleffici
but
construct
cost
go
up
our
concern
is
that
we
need
a
lot
more
fund
for
transport
but
one
of
the
obstacl
to
do
that
is
poll
show
pretti
clear
that
peopl
dont
trust
govern
period
in
some
respect
but
they
dont
trust
that
an
increas
in
the
gas
tax
would
actual
be
use
for
transport
and
there
good
reason
for
that
said
jim
reilli
an
illinoi
govern
veteran
who
is
now
a
senior
fellow
at
the
metropolitan

council
focus
on
transport
issu
so
to
us
the
two
thing
tie
togeth
we
do
think
that
if
we
can
get
the
lockbox
amend
peopl
would
be
more
will
to

tax
reilli
said
other

dont
see
a
path
to
more
money
anytim
soon
given
the
standoff
between
the
republican
governor
and
democrat
lawmak
say
the
amend
is
design
to
take
polit
out
of
the
equat
transport
fund
should
not
be
feast
or
famin
it
should
not
be

as
you
go
we
should
not
have

reli

or
lawmak
come
in

say
we
are

we
should

this
everi

said
poulo
director
of

we
dont
believ
in
the
tenur
of

that

republican
are
go
to
come
to

where
they
can

rariz
the
colead
of

that
avert
a
similar
showdown
in

mccain
said
that
the
environ
is

polar
now
and
that
the
old

power
chairmen
often
war
hero

have

they
consid

collin
the
lead
moder
republican
had
support
hold
a
vote
on

but
now
she
think
democrat
need
to
move
on
becaus
trump
won
the
elect
that
is
in
the
past
and
it
is
not
fair
to
judg
gorsuch
to
deni
him
a

upordown

with

she
said

collin
doesnt
see
a
bipartisan
pact
come
togeth
and
said
lawmak
should
fight
over
the
next
vacanc
on
the
court
i
think
it
would
be
wise
of
the
democrat
to
vote
for
him
and
live
to
fight
anoth
day
some
democrat
have
suggest
privat
that
they
first
must
demonstr
that
they
have
the
vote
to
block
gorsuch
and
then
commenc
negoti
to
avoid
the
nuclear
showdown
but
even
moder
democrat
such
as
carper
are
not
show
much
willing
to
support
a
deal
that
would
put
gorsuch
on
the
court
in
exchang
for
the
possibl
of
filibust
the
next

not
much
of
a
prize
he
said
that
would
set
the
filibust
in
motion
and
almost
like

out

republican
say
they
