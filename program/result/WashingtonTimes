Trump made right call in firing Flynn, White House says
.B
In the wake of a new Pentagon investigation of retired Gen. Michael Flynn receiving payment from foreign governments, the White House said Thursday that President Trump “made the right call at the right time” in firing Mr. Flynn as his national security adviser. White House Sean Spicer said the probe by the Defense Department’s inspector general of Mr. Flynn is “appropriate.” “If they think there’s wrongdoing, then the department’s inspector general should look into that,” Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn as his national security adviser in February after White House officials learned that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during the presidential transition. “I think the president made the right call at the right time,” Mr. Spicer said. The Pentagon’s IG is looking into Mr. Flynn receiving payments from foreign governments and foreign entities after he retired from the Army in 2014, including the RT television network linked to the Russian government. He was advised by the military not to accept such payments. Mr. Spicer also noted that Mr. Flynn received his security clearance renewal during the Obama administration in the spring of 2016, “apparently with knowledge” of his trip to Russia in late 2015. He said he wasn’t accusing the Obama administration of wrongdoing, but added, “I’m just making sure people understand the process and how it works.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump in Harrisburg to mark his 100th day in office, takes dig at ‘boring’ WHCD
.B
President Trump skipped the annual White House Correspondents Dinner Saturday, calling it “boring,” and hosted a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to celebrate his 100th day in office. “Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news, and they’re sitting, and they’re wishing, they’re watching, they’re watching, and they would love to be with us tonight. But they’re trapped at the dinner, which will be very very boring,” he said. Mr. Trumpmade the announcement that he would not attend the dinner back in February and revealed last week that he would instead hold a rally in Harrisburg at the same time as the dinner. The president arrived in the Keystone State Saturday afternoon and made an unexpected trip to a local wheelbarrow factory with Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump said he was glad not to be at the dinner and instead be with his supporters. “I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from the Washington swamp, spending my evening with all of you, and with a much much larger crowd and much better people,” he said. Mr. Trump’s decision not to attend the dinner comes after a long, contentious relationship with the press. Several media outlets debated pulling out of their sponsored events surrounding the dinner, or skipping the event entirely, due to their disagreements with Mr. Trump before he decided not to attend. He is the first president to miss the event since 1981 when then-President Ronald Reagan was absent while recovering from an assassination attempt. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Two-thirds of White House reporters calls Donald Trump the most anti-media president ever: Report
.B
A majority of White House reporters believe President Trump has already established himself as the most openly anti-media president in U.S. history, according to a report from Politico. Published on Mr. Trump’s 100th day in office, the report released Saturday indicates White House journalists overwhelmingly agree the current administration is the worst ever with respect to its interactions with the press. Sixty-eight percent of respondents answered “true” when asked recently if Mr. Trump is the most openly anti-press president in history, Politico reported; about one-third, or 32 percent, responded “false.” What’s more, three-in-four reporters described the president’s frequent attacks against the media as a “distraction,” compared to 25 percent who quantified those assaults as legitimate threats, according to the report. Only 12 percent of respondents, meanwhile, said they haven’t been lied to by a member of the Trump administration. Seventeen percent said they’re subjected to lies “constantly,” while 46 percent said they believe the White House fibs on an occasional basis. Politico’s findings stem from interviews conducted last month with 63 members of the White House press corps and comes on the heels of three similar reports released toward the end of former President Obama’s tenure in office. When asked to rank Mr. Trump and his predecessor on a scale of 1-10 with respect to their overall treatment of the media, respondents offered the current president a score of 7.2, with a score of 10 designating an administration that’s “outright hostile.” Mr. Obama was considered more favorable to the press by respondents and was handed a ranking of 5.3, Politico reported. Mr. Trump has repeatedly labeled media outlets as “fake” since shortly before taking office, and in February declared the press the “enemy of the American people.” The insults have hardly subsided during his first 100 days in office, however, evidenced most recently by a seemingly unprovoked comment made by Mr. Trump during a signing ceremony in Washington on Friday, one day short of the 100-day milestone. “I’m very proud of the people standing behind me. I’m far less proud of the people standing in front of me: the media,” Mr. Trump said Friday. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Voters of faith, pro-lifers say they remain ‘extremely pleased’ with President Trump
.B
After President Trump won the 2016 election, evangelist Franklin Graham shared his thoughts about the force behind the victory during a public rally for the incoming president after the election. “I don’t have any scientific information. I don’t have a stack of  emails to read to you. But I have an opinion: I believe it was God. God  showed up. He answered the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people  across this land who had been praying for this country,” Mr. Graham told a crowd in Alabama. Indeed, millions of voters of faith voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump in November, and they remain his most loyal supporters according to the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which hosted the president as a candidate, and publicly prayed for him during his campaign. “Faith based voters who ushered President Trump into office last November — who were confident in his commitment to the sanctity of human life, and to his pledge to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with a justice who would respect the Constitution — are extremely pleased with his record of accomplishment this early into his presidency,” said Ralph Reed, chairman of the grassroots organization, which boasts more than one million members. He cites surveys released this week by ABC/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal which reveal, among other things, that Mr. Trump’s strongest base of support remains evangelicals; 70 percent continue to support him, as do 52 percent of conservative Catholic voters. Pro-life voters in particular lauded Mr. Trump at his 100-day mark for his pro-life accomplishments in a new report from the Susan B. Anthony List, which calls both the president and Vice President Mike Pence “game changers” for the pro-life movement. “Not only have there been several pro-life victories within the first 100 days of their administration, we are confident that pro-life progress will continue. This is a new era,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the organization. She cites the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s order to stop taxpayer funding of the “abortion industry overseas,” plus specific key appointments of pro-life champions within the Trump administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. There are other political dynamics at work in the faith community after Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez insisted earlier this week that being pro-choice was a “nonnegotiable” issue to be a Democrat — a rigid proclamation that even caused House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to take notice. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, sees an opportunity, however. He is now “inviting pro-life Democrats who are no longer welcome in their party to cross the aisle,” noting that a recent Pew Research Center found that 28 percent of Democrats say they would like to see abortion illegal in all or most cases. “Perez, and all Democratic public officials who support child-killing, are hypocrites on many levels, because they are unwilling to describe the very procedure they support,” said Father Pavone. “Meanwhile, what are those pro-life Democrats to do, trapped in a party that clearly doesn’t want them? Some work to change the party. But if the party doesn’t listen, switch parties.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

NRA’s LaPierre: It’s time to get lower-court vacancies filled
.B
ATLANTA — Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, told NRA members on Saturday it’s time for the dozens of vacancies on federal courts to get filled and it’s up to them to back President Trump long enough to appoint the new lower-court judges and reshape the U.S. Supreme Court “forever.” “When Obama said he wanted to transform America, he did just that,” Mr. LaPierre said at the NRA’s annual meeting of members. Mr. LaPierre said former President Obama appointed 331 judges to federal courts and flipped the ideological balance on 13 U.S. Courts of Appeals. “This lower courts… are incredibly important,” he said. “They hear more than 400,000 cases a year. They are where future Supreme Court nominees are found. They are the first line of judicial defense of all of our liberties.” He said there are currently 127 vacancies on federal courts. “We are grateful for Judge Gorsuch, and it’s time now for a hundred more conservative, pro-Second Amendment judges on benches throughout this country,” he said. Mr. LaPierre also said it’s time for Supreme Court Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, generally seen as part of the court’s liberal-leaning wing, “to go.” “Thank God President Trump got elected and put Judge Gorsuch on the bench,” he said. “It’s our job to back this president long enough to completely repopulate the federal judiciary and change the United States Supreme Court forever,” he said.

Crowded primary field seeks to fill Mick Mulvaney’s seat
.B
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Tuesday’s primary to pick a replacement for Mick Mulvaney doesn’t have the drama of the special congressional elections in Kansas and Georgia, where money poured in for candidates vying to replace lawmakers leaving Congress to serve in the Trump administration. But the race to fill South Carolina’s 5th District seat, vacated by Mulvaney’s confirmation as White House budget director, has drawn 14 candidates and is emblematic of how contentious politics has become in the Trump era. The seat was controlled by Democrats for more than 100 years before the tea party wave of 2010 that swept in Mulvaney. Republicans say their hold on the seat during Mulvaney’s tenure - coupled with Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the district by more than 18 percent - shows a trend toward conservatism in this deeply red state. Seven Republicans and three Democrats are running in Tuesday’s primary. A candidate must garner 50 percent of the vote plus one to win his or her party’s primary. If either party has no outright winner, a runoff will be held May 16. The primary winners will then join four third-party contenders in a June 20 general election. The eventual winner would be in office for about 18 months before facing re-election in 2018. THE REPUBLICANS - Tommy Pope, House speaker pro tem. The former prosecutor previously said he planned to run for governor in 2018 but switched to Congress once Mulvaney was nominated. As a solicitor in the 1990s, Pope rose to nationwide fame for his case against a Union County mother now serving a life sentence for killing her two sons by rolling her car into a lake. Pope has the support of dozens of current prosecutors, sheriffs and other law officers. - Chad Connelly. After two terms leading South Carolina’s GOP, the Prosperity native served as the faith engagement initiative director for the Republican National Committee, traveling the country rallying activists to help register and mobilize conservative, faith-based voters. He has endorsements from Christian conservatives like James Dobson and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, as well as U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, who heads up the Freedom Caucus in Congress. - Sheri Few. A former member of South Carolina’s GOP Executive Committee, the abstinence-only, anti-Common Core activist from Lugoff founded South Carolina Parents Involved in Education to join with other public school parents concerned with increased federal role in education and the added emphasis on testing and data collection. She managed U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann’s 2012 presidential campaign in South Carolina. Few lost the GOP primary for education superintendent in 2014. - Ralph Norman. Norman resigned his state House seat to concentrate on his campaign amid the growing field, meaning there’s also a special election going on to fill his legislative seat. It isn’t the Rock Hill real estate developer’s first go at the 5th District; Norman lost to incumbent John Spratt in 2006. - Tom Mullikan. The Camden native is an attorney, specializing in global environmental policy. Mullikan is also a former U.S. Army JAG officer is the current commander of the all-volunteer South Carolina State Guard. He’s been touting his support of President Trump’s polices and has said Trump’s outsider win inspired him to consider running for office himself. - Ray Craig. Craig, who does ministerial and nonprofit work in Lake Wylie, unsuccessfully challenged Mulvaney in the 2016 GOP primary, calling the incumbent too conservative for the district. - Kris Wampler. The Charlotte attorney lives in Lake Wylie and practices family law. DEMOCRATS - Archie Parnell. The former Goldman Sachs tax adviser and Capitol Hill lawyer from Sumter has posted the highest fundraising figures among the Democratic contenders, bringing in nearly a quarter-million dollars in the first month of his campaign, mostly in donations of $100 or less. Tax reform and job creation are among his top priorities. Parnell is endorsed by South Carolina’s two most recent democratic governors, Jim Hodges and Dick Riley, as well as Spratt. - Alexis Frank. Frank, an Army veteran married to an active-duty Marine, previously worked as a paralegal in an Army JAG legal affairs office. She lives in Rock Hill and lists education reform as among her top issues. - Les Murphy. Murphy, a disabled Marine veteran, founded Carolina Veterans Commission, a faith-based nonprofit that connects veterans to housing, professional development and educational opportunities. He’s also worked as a human resources manager at Lowes Home Improvement and lives in Indian Land. THIRD PARTIES They’re not in the mix until the June general election, but there are also four third-party candidates vying for the 5th District seat: Bill Bledsoe (Constitution); Victor Kocher (Libertarian); David Kulma (Green); and Josh Thornton (American). ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Sheriff David Clarke: ‘Rat bastards’ on the left never give up
.B
ATLANTA — Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. on Friday issued criticism that spanned the political spectrum, telling gun-rights activists that “rat bastards on the left” never give up while also saying some of the misadventures of the GOP-led Congress can be “very painful” to watch. “We won a huge battle last November, but we did not win the war,” Sheriff Clarke said at the NRA lobbying arm’s 2017 Leadership Forum. “You see, our fight for freedom continues in earnest.” “You see, these rat bastards on the left never give up,” he said. “No, I didn’t misspeak. “You see, for them defeat is never final. Election defeats don’t matter,” he said. “It’s simply a time to regroup and continue their assault on our Constitution, the rule of law, liberty, and American exceptionalism. “Now, why would I call them rat bastards?” he said. “First of all, because I can. Second, as you know I call ‘em as I see ‘em. But third and more importantly, just listen to Saul Alinsky, a socialist professor who admired Lucifer, for heaven’s sake. And Alinsky’s admired by the left.” Sheriff Clarke is a popular speaker among conservative crowds, and he addressed the Republican National Convention last year in Cleveland. “As you know, I worked hard to help Donald Trump get elected president of the United States, and I will fight even harder to help him make American great again,” he said. Politico reported Friday that Sheriff Clarke is under consideration for a position at the Department of Homeland Security. But he also made clear he’s not entirely thrilled with Republicans, either, as he called for Congress to pass national concealed carry reciprocity legislation. “Folks, we have to have a renewed sense of urgency about prodding GOP leaders in Congress to finally pass this bill,” he said. “We have waited long enough, damn it.” “Now, I don’t want to come down too hard on the GOP-led Congress, but they can’t seem to be able to get out of their own way at times,” he said. “Sometimes it’s very painful to watch.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

ATLANTA — Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday teased another looming U.S. Supreme Court vacancy, saying there’s a good chance there will be a chance for gun-rights activists to mobilize on the issue once more either this summer or next. “I believe very soon we’re going to see another vacancy,” Mr. Cruz told attendees at the National Rifle Association lobbying arm’s “Leadership Forum” in Atlanta. “I think the odds are significant that we’ll see another vacancy either this summer or next summer,” he said. “This next vacancy, I hope and pray that President Trump continues to honor his promise to nominate principled constitutionalist[s] who will ferociously defend the Bill of Rights. “And when that happens, it will be incumbent on all of us — each and every one of us — to inform, to educate, to mobilize the American people that the only way we defend our liberties is if we stand up and fight to protect the Bill of Rights and the Constitution,” he said. Mr. Cruz, who was Mr. Trump’s top rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, had made a similar prediction about a looming vacancy earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). On Friday, Mr. Cruz also praised Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was Mr. Trump’s pick to fill the last vacancy left on the high court by Justice Antonin Scalia. “God bless the NRA,” he said. “It’s 2017. And Hillary Clinton is not president of the United States. “And Neil Gorsuch is a Supreme Court Justice,” he said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Trump to NRA: ‘You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you’
.B
ATLANTA — President Trump on Friday became the first sitting U.S. president since Ronald Reagan to speak at the NRA’s annual convention, pledging to “come through” for gun-rights activists like they did for him last year. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,” Mr. Trump said at the NRA lobbying arm’s 2017 “Leadership Forum.” “The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,” he said. “You have a true friend and champion in the White House.” The gun-rights group endorsed Mr. Trump at its convention last May in Louisville, Kentucky, and was one of his biggest outside boosters in the 2016 presidential campaign. “You’re my friends, believe me,” he said. “To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.” He talked up his pick for the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, as well as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s reversal of an Obama-era ban on lead ammunition on certain federal lands, as examples of actions he’s taken thus far that are friendly to gun rights advocates. “I promised that if elected, I would nominate a justice who would be faithful and loyal to the Constitution,” he said. “I kept my promise, and with your help, our brand-new justice, and he is really something very special, Neil Gorsuch, sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court.” He also said his administration has worked to restore the “rule of law” and said it will always stand with “the incredible men and women of law enforcement.” Mr. Trump also vowed once again to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, though the White House recently backed off demands to include money for the wall in a government funding showdown with Congress this week. “We need the wall,” he said. “It’s a wall in certain areas. Obviously, where you have these massive physical structures you don’t need, and we have certain big rivers … but we need a wall, and we’re going to get that wall.” As he approaches the 100th day of his administration, Mr. Trump also fondly recalled Election Night 2016 and some of the states he unexpectedly won. “What fun that was — November 8,” he said. “Wasn’t that a great evening?” He said Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College system. “Not gonna forget that evening,” he said. “Big sports fans said that was the most exciting event they’ve ever seen. That includes Super Bowls, and World Series, and boxing matches.” He warned that the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee could be “Pocahontas,” his nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts due to her claims of Indian heritage that have been questioned. “And she is not big for the NRA — that I can tell you,” he said. The president was scheduled to speak later in the day at a reception on behalf of Karen Handel, the Republican candidate running to fill Georgia’s Atlanta-area 6th congressional district seat formerly held by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. He gave Ms. Handel a shout-out in the speech and reminded attendees a runoff election will take place on June 20. “She’s totally for the NRA and she’s totally for the Second Amendment, so get out and vote,” he said. Ms. Handel faces Democrat Jon Ossoff, who Mr. Trump said would “raise your taxes to the sky” and “destroy your health care.” The NRA’s annual meeting was supposed to draw some 80,000 attendees, and many were ready to give Mr. Trump solid marks thus far. “Normally, whatever he says, I agree with,” said Rosemary Pereira, 75, a retiree from Florida. “To me, he doesn’t say anything wrong. He’s just doing the right thing.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

We all knew where our country was headed, and we didn’t quit,” he said.

Early voting kicks off in Montana, but Democrats hold back funds
.B
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee doesn’t seem to be spending big money in Montana’s special election as early voting kicks off this week. The race for the lone House seat in the state, vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, seems to be overshadowed by the Georgia runoff race in June, where Democrats are still pouring money in the hopes of flipping that district after nearly winning the seat earlier this month. But in Montana, the race isn’t shaping up to be as close. Democratic musician Rob Quist is facing a steep climb against Republican businessman Greg Gianforte in the month remaining before the May 25 election. Mr. Quist is getting some help from outside Democratic groups and even celebrity donations, but President Trump remains very popular in the state that voted for him by over 20 points. Republicans are taking no chances, however, and having spent over $2 million from outside groups. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., also campaigned with Mr. Gianforte earlier this month.

Democrats seeking revenge prepare to mark 100 days of ‘resistance’
.B
For Democrats, the Trump administration has offered a chance for payback. Still sour over the way Republicans treated President Obama, the Democratic minority has one word to describe its strategy toward President Trump: resistance. “There is a difference between obstruction, which is what congressional Republicans engaged in in the early days of the Obama administration, and resistance, where Democrats have been opposed to policies that would be detrimental to the American people,” said Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries of New York, a newly minted member of the House Democratic leadership team. “Resistance is anchored in defending your policy priorities that are consistent with your perspective, but being willing to work with the other side of the aisle when policies are proposed, that would be good for America,” he said. Mr. Trump marks his 100th day in office on Saturday having faced unwavering opposition to his agenda from Democrats. They have erected the worst delay of Cabinet picks in U.S. history, mounted a filibuster of his universally acclaimed Supreme Court nominee, fought his efforts to rewrite Obamacare and prompted investigations into his administration’s dealings with Russia. They also have cheered from the outside — and occasionally assisted with legal briefs — as the federal courts have blocked Mr. Trump’s immigration plans. The anti-Trump sentiment has become so ingrained in the Democratic mindset that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi struggled to come up with an answer Thursday when asked if she had something positive to say about the president’s first 100 days. The California Democrat instead talked about Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter. “I was thinking he was more of a creature that stalked the night, that these things just came out at night like a vampire, that he tweeted these things,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “But now it’s spread to the morning. So let me think for a while.” Democrats came out on the losing end of the November elections, ceding control of the White House and failing to win the House or the Senate — the latter of which had seemed within reach in the waning days of the campaign. As they pick up the pieces, Democrats have concluded that their path back to power relies not on finding common ground but rather on fighting Mr. Trump at every turn, save for the few issues where he agrees with them. “I think our caucus and the party as a whole after the election and the loss to Trump went through a whole defining period: Who are we?” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, Arizona Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “I think what has occurred now is that at least in this caucus now in the House, I see more unity than I have ever seen before. There is some common purpose.” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York set the tone before Mr. Trump was sworn in. “If the president-elect proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure and trade and closing the carried interest loophole, we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it, but when he doesn’t, we will resist,” Mr. Schumer said in his first address to the chamber as the Democratic leader. Mr. Schumer’s stance marks a stunning reversal. He used to criticize House Republicans for being beholden to the right-wing tea party movement, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, says it’s now Mr. Schumer who is beholden to his left flank. Mr. McConnell said that has led to “just delay for delay’s sake.” Progressives, though, say they want to see still more obstruction. They forced Democrats to filibuster Justice Neil Gorsuch, which Senate Republicans countered with the “nuclear option,” altering the rules and making it easier for Mr. Trump to get more nominees to the high court. Unbowed, liberal activists say the energy of the fight was worth it. They say Democrats can win by channeling the anti-Trump energy, sending a clear message that the Democratic Party is united after a nasty presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders. “I’m telling right now, the Democratic Party, there is a new spirit y’all,” Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the vice deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told progressive activists this week. “It is not the same old thing.” Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a progressive group, said the public is behind the resistance. “I think it is pretty significant that the first 100 days of his presidency there has not been a significant bill passed,” said Mr. Chamberlain, adding that Democrats will have little incentive to change their tactics unless Mr. Trump starts to deliver on the promises he made to working-class voters. “It seems like it is just a fantasy to discuss a situation where Democrats should be willing to work with him,” he said. “When you think about the future, the future is continued opposition. It is strong opposition.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its candidate recruitment for the midterm elections next year is off to a good start. “The amount of top-tier candidates already stepping forward to run for Congress this early in the cycle is very encouraging,” said Tyler Law, DCCC spokesman. “There’s no question that we’re seeing a huge uptick in energy at a time when Democrats are on offense across an expanded battlefield.” For now, Democrats have had to take solace in moral victories. They touted the 7 percentage point loss they suffered in a special election race in a deep-red congressional district in Kansas as a win and are playing up Democrat Jon Ossoff’s chances of winning a June runoff race in Georgia — though many political observers say Republican Karen Handle is the favorite. On Capitol Hill, Democrats celebrated this week after Mr. Trump backed off his demand for funding for a border wall in a short-term spending bill that lawmakers are trying to hash out to avoid a government shutdown. That concession still wasn’t enough for Mr. Schumer. He said Thursday that he would block the stopgap bill. Democrats also cheered on the more conservative elements of the Republican caucus that sunk the White House’s opening bid to repeal and replace Obamacare. Asked about the performance of his party over first 100 days of the Trump administration, Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said, “It is still a work in progress.” “We are in a special position here as the minority — not only a minority, but a superminority with the House and the Senate, and obviously with the presidency [in Republican control],” he said. “So our ability to initiate, to actually demand things on the floor is more than limited — it doesn’t exist. “So I think the standard of success is completely different from that of the majority,” he said.

ATLANTA — Gun rights backers need to make sure that election victories translate into action on Capitol Hill and expanded support in the states, the National Rifle Association’s legislative chief said Thursday, a day ahead of President Trump’s speech at the NRA’s annual convention. Enacting concealed-carry reciprocity, which would allow permit holders from one state to carry their weapons anywhere else in the U.S., is a top priority for the NRA now that the organization has a friendly Congress and a president it eagerly backed. But Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told The Washington Times that NRA members can’t become complacent in the post-Obama era. “We’ll leave Atlanta with a determination to make sure that November wasn’t a temporary moment but a permanent political red line,” he said. “American freedom and individual freedom is too important to suffer due to apathy. NRA members know that, and I think you’re going to see a reflection of that this weekend.” Mr. Cox said the NRA is excited to have Mr. Trump in the White House but that the work isn’t done. “This is an important time in Second Amendment history,” he said. “It was a critical battle that was won, but the war rages on and we’re still getting up and fighting every day to protect the rights of our members, and it’s going to be a big celebration of that this weekend in Atlanta.” Mr. Cox said executive actions such as the selection of Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court and rolling back an Obama-era rule on Social Security and gun background checks give Mr. Trump a solid A thus far. “Across the board, we are seeing measurables and deliverables from President Trump as it relates to the Second Amendment,” he said. “Now, does that mean everything’s done and we need to all stop worrying? Of course not. The fight’s still there; we have to continue to push the ball forward,” he said. At the top of the list at the federal level is getting the national concealed carry reciprocity bill through Congress and onto Mr. Trump’s desk. “The expansion of self-defense will remain our No. 1 legislative priority until the rights of law-abiding Americans are respected,” Mr. Cox said. “We’re working hard to educate and encourage co-sponsorship and work through the appropriate legislative process, and at the same time leveraging our greatest asset in this fight, which are NRA members all across this country,” he said. “So we feel good about our chances, but there’s a lot of work to do, obviously,” he said. All 50 states allow some kind of concealed carry, but they have different rules and requirements about how people obtain permits and which out-of-state permits are recognized. Gun rights advocates say a national standard should be set, but opponents of such a move say a federal bill could undermine states that have imposed stricter rules. “Get it passed — I don’t care how they do it,” said Paul Heimbach, 78, a retired Air Force officer from Florida. “The Democrats are going to be against it regardless.” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said he has no doubt that concealed carry reciprocity will pass the House but not necessarily the Senate. Republicans control 52 of the 100 Senate seats but would have to attract some Democratic support to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to thwart any filibuster. “Getting the bill through the Senate will be a little bit tougher,” Mr. Pratt said. “We have a clear majority of senators supporting the bill, and we are working to make sure there are enough to break a filibuster.” Beyond Congress, though, Mr. Cox said the NRA is engaged at the state level as well. “We saw in Iowa a comprehensive pro-Second Amendment bill signed into law,” he said. “We’ve seen in state after state more pro-gun laws. No anti-gun legislation has been signed into law this year, but obviously we’re working hard to make sure that holds. “Whether it takes us into the Congress or onto the airwaves or into state legislatures or into courtrooms, that’s where you’ll find us,” he said. The NRA endorsed Mr. Trump at its convention last year in Louisville, Kentucky, months before the he formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Cox said the president’s attendance this year indicates that he knows how critical that support was. On Friday, Mr. Trump will become the first sitting U.S. president to speak at the convention since Ronald Reagan. “We made that commitment early,” Mr. Cox said. “We were consistent. It was a lonely summer. There were times when we were the only group in America with the guts to support him.” “But we never wavered because the stakes of the election and consequences of [the] election never changed,” he said. Gun control activists are planning to protest in Atlanta this weekend after Mr. Trump’s appearance and have tried to organize aggressively on lobbying efforts in recent years as well. Mr. Cox said the NRA can’t go “dollar for dollar” with someone like former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who helped found the group Everytown for Gun Safety. “But what we’ve been able to do is beat him vote by vote,” he said. “So if he wants to engage in this issue, we welcome the fight.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Does America even want freedom anymore?

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Headlines rocked in recent days about the latest Berkeley episode of snowflake teardropping, the one where conservative bigwig Ann Coulter was supposed to come to campus to speak, but threats of violence from offended students waylaid her plans. Everybody cried about the hit to free speech — and rightly so. But the Coulter-Berkeley fiasco, and the ding to free speech, is not the problem, in and of itself. It’s only a symptom of a much larger problem  — a symptom of a deeper, darker spirit that’s infected America, spreading far and wide as it seeks to destroy the nation’s greatest asset. The fact that in America, our individual rights come from God, not government. Understand that, and the Berkeley-Coulter tiff is just a small bump on a very rocky road Americans have been traversing for years now, the one that leads away from a heavenly authority and right smack into the hands of a secular force called the kingdom of government. Coulter vs. Berkeley is just a cause-effect example of this — of what really ails the country. A moral citizenry would not — could not — riot over rhetoric. Of course, it came on the heels of the same university setting itself on fire over the perceived offenses of former Breitbart newser, Milo Yiannopoulos, who had been scheduled to appear at the campus in February, but who was similarly forced to cancel. Now Milo’s vowing to storm the campus for a seven-day September free speech event, and this is what he says about it: “I’ll bring an army if I have to. I have the money to do it. And if the university refuses to actively help us in planning it or tries to block us, we will make it even longer, a month-long rally, not just one week.” Storm-trooping for free speech — what have we become, America? Milo’s mission is similar to one put forth by American Freedom Defense Initiative president Pamela Geller in 2015. Back then Geller oversaw a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas, to show, in blunt fashion, that America’s First Amendment comes before sharia law — that the religion of Islam may prohibit the drawing of their prophet but the U.S. Constitution does not. For that, she was roundly and soundly criticized and condemned, not just by Muslim groups and their leftist supporters, but also by the media — the media, for crying out loud, which makes its bread and butter off freedom of speech — and by conservatives and Republicans and others who would normally defend the Constitution. “We absolutely must have other events like this to stand up for free speech,” an unapologetic Geller told NBC News then. “I will not abridge my freedoms so as not to offend savages.” Storm-trooping for free speech. The sad reality of modern day America. But it’s not just speech that’s being stifled around the nation. “The rise of a surveillance state has raised questions about the legality of how law enforcement agencies acquire new technologies and inform the public of their use,” the Center for Investigative Reporting wrote in May 2014. Post-9/11, individual privacy rights have routinely been placed secondary to national security.  Pat-downs at the nation’s airports have crossed the line into accosting. Data collection and data storage have become mysterious workings of inner-government — ones that thrust even a questioning citizen among the ranks of the suspicious. Public schools have more and more frequently found it perfectly acceptable to enter parental domain to control what students eat, what children read and how they ought to think. Government bodies that are supposed to serve the people — like the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles, to name just a few — far too frequently subjugate, regulate and violate them. The welfare of the collective is replacing the rights of the individual. And propelling this socialist view forward is, sorrowfully, the younger generation, comprised of individuals who know nothing of the true price of freedom — who’ve not been forced to pay with sweat and blood and loss, as the patriots of America’s founding days were or as the brave U.S. military fighters of subsequent decades were. Rather, for them freedom is being free of offensive thoughts. They think freedom means being pain-free, struggle-free, effort-free, offense-free. And they think any kinks that threaten that definition of freedom must be obliterated. Like Coulter, like Milo, like Geller — like all those with patriotic, conservative, free-market, good old-fashioned American principles and Judeo-Christian beliefs. But why do they think that way? Because our nation, through the years, has chosen to let government be the guide, not God. We’ve picked a path of moral comfort, not compass, and the price is an anything-goes culture that caters to the lowest denominator of humanity. It’s not Coulter. It’s not free speech. It’s not even snowflakes and the adults who cater to their whines. It’s the loss of God from governance, opening the door to a lawless society and chaotic structure — that’s what really ails us. And that’s what must be addressed, if we really want to be a nation of free people once again. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Spooked by the power of words, words, words
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: The only thing anyone is allowed to hear on campus is a slogan. Thinking is so 20th century (and early 20th century at that). The adults paid to be in charge have retreated to a safe place, where never is heard an encouraging word and the skies are cloudy all day. The First Amendment has been under the latest assault for months, and this week Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and onetime chairman of the Democratic Party, finally said out loud what certain prominent Democrats have hinted at and alluded to, that free speech does not necessarily include extending it to anyone who disagrees with them. This poison spread, like so much of the toxic stuff polluting the body politic, from the campuses of the elite. Particularly the University of California at Berkeley, where visiting speakers with something to say can’t say it because it might offend the sophomore class. Cowardice rules in the university president’s office and ignorance rules in Sproul Plaza. A speech by Ann Coulter, the firebrand columnist, was canceled because everyone was afraid of what she might say. Miss Coulter, a slender woman who might weigh 90 pounds stepping out of a shower, was eager to take her chances facing down the mob to say her piece, whatever that piece might have been, but the Berkeley cops, the university administration, the sponsoring Young America’s Foundation and the College Republicans, all trembled, looked one way and then the other, and took a powder lest the hooded brownshirts — dressed in black with robbers’ masks, actually — disrupt the tranquility of the campus. The editors of National Review magazine observed with a bit of acid that Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California System, was Barack Obama’s Director of Homeland Security and was responsible for keeping al Qaeda out of New York and Washington, but she can’t secure a lecture hall on a California college campus. But even in defending free speech and all that free speech means, the editors prefaced their condemnation of cowardice and outrage at Berkeley with something of an apology for defending Miss Coulter: “We have had our differences with Ann Coulter over the years, differences that led to our eventually declining to continue publishing her work. She is charming and funny and sometimes brilliant. She is also a glib and irresponsible self-promoter. We suspect that she will not like having that written about her. We suspect that she might write something in reply.” But the editors think it is nevertheless wrong, or at least inappropriate, to chase her off the campus. Probably. Howard Dean likes free speech and the First Amendment well enough, but with appropriate edits and the proper emendations. He looked at the work of the Founding Fathers with a physician’s eye and saw that the guarantee was not absolute, as the Founding Fathers thought it was. The amendment does not protect “hate speech,” which he thinks is anything unpleasant for a good fellow like him to hear. The Founding Fathers thought they succeeded in writing the guarantee in stark, plain English — so plain and so clear, in fact, that even a lawyer could understand it: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” No ifs, ands, or buts, and not a single whereas. Nothing there about hate speech, exclusions, preclusions or exceptions. This gives some people palpitations. It’s no mystery why such people are invariably at the likes of Berkeley and Yale and Middlebury. You’re not as likely to see or hear proposed footnotes to the First Amendment at the likes of Southeast North Dakota State, Utah A&M or Ouachita Baptist College. “In First Amendment law,” says Glenn Harlan Reynolds, the distinguished professor of constitutional law at the University of Tennessee, “the term ‘hate speech’ is meaningless. All speech is equally protected whether it’s hateful or cheerful. It doesn’t matter if it’s racist, sexist or in poor taste, unless speech falls into a few very narrow categories — like ‘true threats,’ which have to address a specific individual, or ‘incitement,’ which must constitute an immediate and intentional encouragement to imminent lawless action — it’s protected.” There’s a reason why the Founders put the First Amendment first. It’s the most important part of the Constitution, and as important as the rest of the Bill of Rights is, the First Amendment is the most important. With free speech, the people are armed to protect all other rights. Without it, the people are disarmed, and tyrants, the vile and ignorant like the students on certain campuses among us, rule. We allow that at our deadly peril. • Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Coulter the latest target of liberal attack on free speech
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Liberals ready and willing to resort to violence in support of their views have just won a round in their war to suppress free speech in America. After much back and forth, conservative commentator Ann Coulter has canceled a speech at University of California, Berkeley primarily because of the lack of protection from the local police and the inability to ensure the safety of Ms. Coulter and those attending her address. Ms. Coulter called it “a sad day for free speech.” I say it’s a sad day for America. America cannot become another Cuba or North Korea, where citizens have no right to speak freely. The right to free speech is enshrined in our Bill of Rights, and those extreme liberals who are terrorizing college campuses and targeting conservatives have the ultimate goal of silencing any opposing voices. We must all stand against this kind of intimidation on campuses. Free speech should be one of those causes on which both conservatives and liberals can find common ground. Liberal professor Cornel West said on Fox News that he is committed to “unnerving students,” adding that college campuses should be “unsettled spaces rather than safe spaces.” College is a time for developing critical thought, facing tough questions and fostering intellectual curiosity — which means being exposed to different points of views. None of that can happen when liberal bullies call their conservative peers insulting names and block the expression of alternative, conservative views on campus — a traditional oasis of freedom of thought and expression. Berkeley, of course, has a history of its own on the issue. Over 1,000 students in 1964 joined the Free Speech Movement and held a protest demanding that the university lift a ban on political activities and free expression. Today, on that same campus, bandits and anarchists are effectively in charge, employing violent tactics to suppress conservative political activities and events. University administrators lack the will and the power to face down the bullies. Conservatives speakers have become an easy target for those liberals, who are always ready to denounce anyone who challenges their beliefs as sexists and racists. Ms. Coulter, thankfully, does not shy away from the controversy but confronts it, exposing the hypocrisy of her accusers at every turn. Last year, the provocative author and commentator participated in an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, a proponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants, where she answered tough questions on immigration from an audience that included those in the U.S. illegally. These individuals did not agree with her, but it was an opportunity for real give-and-take. Berkeley students have been deprived of the same opportunity by those liberals who use violence to enforce political correctness on our college campuses, creating fear, trampling on our constitutional rights and promoting an anti-American philosophy. When I was a college student, my alma mater, Florida International University, hosted an event for Cuban communists. With so many students at the school coming from families who had recently fled the murderous Castro regime, it was obviously an emotional day for many of us. I remember feeling, in Mr. West’s word, “unnerved,” but I listened to the speakers’ critical views of the United States and their doctrinal speeches on the glories of communism. We engaged in heated conversations, but the exchange was, in the end, enlightening. It helped me further understand the evils of communism and the ignorance of those individuals who live under the regime and follow the dictator’s rules. In Cuba, of course, I would never have been allowed to participate in a similar forum at University of Havana, or to criticize Castro on Cuban soil. It simply was not allowed. The United States literally came into being because of the Founding Fathers’ willingness to debate and disagree — often heatedly — on issues such as state rights, federalism and the rights of the governed. They understood more than two centuries ago that open forums of debate and discussion were fundamental to finding common ground and to the long-term health of the American experiment. The growing intolerance on campus — and the willingness of university administrators to shelter their students from challenging voices and contrary opinions — will have long-term negative effects. By excluding conservatives from their debates and allowing those willing to use violence to dominate the conversation, the universities lose their own voice and are weakened as institutions. Extreme liberal groups with a violent agenda should not win. Freedom of speech and the U.S. Constitution must prevail. • Mercedes Schlapp is a Fox News contributor, co-founder of Cove Strategies and former White House director of specialty media under President George W.

The knives are out! Elizabeth Warren turns on Obama, she’s ‘troubled’ by $400K Wall Street speech
.B
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she is “troubled” by former President Barack Obama’s decision to give a Wall Street speech for $400,000 this year. An interview between Ms. Warren and Sirius XM’s “Alter Family Politics” on Thursday addressed Mr. Obama’s upcoming conference talk run by Cantor Fitzgerald LP. The Democrat likened the money he will make to “a snake that slithers through Washington” and “ultimately threatens democracy.” “I was troubled by that,” the senator said while discussing “This is our Fight,” her new book. “One of the things I talk about in the book is the influence of money. I  describe it as a snake that slithers through Washington. It shows up in  so many in so many different ways here in Washington. You know, people  understand […] the money that goes into campaign contributions. And  when I say ‘understand,’ I don’t mean they think it’s OK — but at  least people see it.” The Daily Caller noted Thursday that Mr. Obama’s speaking fees nearly double those obtained by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “The influence of dollars on this place is what scares me,” Ms. Warren said. “I think it  ultimately threatens democracy. […] The rich and powerful, they got  money and they got power. That’s the definition. But you know, there’s  more of us than there is of them.” An analysis of the senator’s net worth on Jan. 8, 2015, by CNN Money found her to be worth between $3.7 million and $10 million. The network’s numbers did not include a three-story home with an estimated worth of $1.9 million. “Roll Call recently ranked her the 76th wealthiest out of 541 senators  and representatives, based on her minimum net worth in 2013,” CNN reported. “Her average net worth of $8.75 million, including her home, secures her a spot the Top 1 percent bracket in terms of wealth.” Eric Schultz, Mr. Obama’s spokesman, said Wednesday that any talk about speaking fees for the former president should acknowledge “the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR” that were implemented during his administration.

Hollywood director demeans teenage cancer-survivors’ looks to take shot at Republicans
.B
Hollywood producer-director Joss Whedon judged a group of teenage cancer survivors according to their (lack of) sexual attractiveness in order to take a shot at Republicans. Mr. Whedon tweeted out a picture of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan meeting some teenagers and said they didn’t measure up in the attractiveness department. “Tonight on White House Wife Hunt, Donny makes host P. Ryan give 2 more contestants the ‘Not a 10’ card,” tweeted Mr. Whedon, best known as the creator of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Firefly” and other TV shows and as the director of two “Avengers” movies. According to Mr. Ryan, who had tweeted out the same picture, the girls were Wisconsin teenagers who “shared some powerful stories with me about their fight against childhood cancer.” Numerous users on Twitter quickly pounced on Mr. Whedon’s remarks about the girls’ looks, calling them cruel, sexist and more. “The epitome of misogyny right here. Take a bow, bro,: said female Twitter user “Grace Under Pressure.” Added Franklin Harris: “Those are cancer survivors. Why do you keep insulting strong women? Is it because people keep asking you that question?” Other folks fired back in kind, taking shots at Mr. Whedon’s own looks. “As young cancer survivors they look a hell of a lot better than your Nicole Kidman/Ginger Baker mashup,” said Jay Caruso of the conservative Red State site. Some Twitter users noted that Mr. Whedon has a history of demeaning remarks about women. “He’s always ready to insult women if they cross sideways of his worldview. Ask Nicole Kidman for starters,” said Will Gregory. In January, Mr. Whedon had responded to Ms. Kidman saying it was time to accept that Donald Trump will be the president, by posting a photo of the blond actress juxtaposed with one of a blond Barbie doll. It was accompanied with the words “Puppets for Trump: Blunderturds are Go!” In about an hour, Mr. Whedon’s new tweet about the teenage cancer survivors had been “liked” almost 300 times.

Portland protesters call for reinstating parade canceled over threat of protests
.B
Portland “antifascist” groups have called for bringing back Saturday’s rose parade, even though fears of violence from left-wing protesters are what prompted organizers to nix the popular event in the first place. The Direct Action Alliance and Oregon Students Empowered, which had planned to protest the parade in order to counter “Nazis” and “fascists,” urged supporters on Thursday to sign a petition to bring back the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade, held in East Portland. “This community has already been threatened and affected by these radical Christian extremists enough,” said the Direct Action Alliancepost on Facebook. SEE ALSO: Portland parade canceled after protesters threaten to rough up Republicans Both groups insisted they had nothing to do with an anonymous email threatening to shut down the event unless the Multnomah County Republican Party was excluded, but those commenting online were stunned by the protesters’ chutzpah. “Seriously guys? You [expletives] are the reason it got canceled to begin with,” John DeGroff said on Facebook. “Victimizers playing the victim.” Parade organizers cancelled the 11th annual event Tuesday after receiving an email that offered a choice: Bar the local GOP, or “we will have two hundred or more people rush into the parade into the middle and drag and push those people out.” “You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,” said the email from thegiver@riseup.net. Oregon Students Empowered said it had “no affiliation to the letter,” adding “we wish that the parade organizers could have removed these nazis from marching in Portland instead of shutting down the parade for everyone who has nothing to do with it.” The petition posted on Change.org by Diane Gill called for a compromise, asking the Multnomah County Republicans to “proactively exclude those who wish to use the parade to promote hateful, biased, exclusionary messaging against immigrants, the queer community, communities of color and other marginalized groups.” In return, protest groups like “Rise Up, the Direct Action Alliance and/or any other group” were asked to “refrain from committing and/or threatening to commit violence or damage during the parade.” Direct Action Alliance accused the Multnomah County Republicans of planning to allow a “neo-Nazi hate group march in their event,” and linked to a Jan. 30 story in Willamette Week about a protest group called Bible Believers. “We will continue to be a voice for non-violent resistance and we will always defend our community,” the alliance said. More generally, the group has equated supporters of President Trump to Nazis. An April 22 post shows a man wearing a red “Make America Great Again” ball cap against the backdrop of a World War II Nazi soldier raising his hands in surrender when confronted with a bayonet above the caption, “We beat ‘em before, we’ll beat ‘em again!” The alliance also made it clear that it had no problem with taking action at the parade. “The nazis know that we’ll keep shutting their marches down, they are now planning to march within other parades to protect their message of hate and white supremacy — it WON’T work,” said the DAA in an April 22 post promoting the parade protest. “Nazis will not march through Portland.” Multnomah County Republican Party Chairman James Buchal dismissed the alliance’s claims about Republicans working in league with neo-Nazis as “libelous nonsense.” “As a practical matter, we post an event on our website. People show up. We do not take applicants and screen participants,” Mr. Buchal said in an email. “If someone shows up and wants to march with us carrying a swastika, or to shout at parade onlookers and tell them they are going to Hell, you may rest assured we are not going to put up with that.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Disabled Iowa man filmed crawling out of store after employee takes away electric cart
.B
A sporting goods retail chain has apologized after a video of a disabled Iowa man crawling out of a store on his knees because he was denied an electric cart in the parking lot exploded on social media. Shane Zahn, who is missing his right foot, told local CBS affiliate KIMT that his son dropped him off in front of the Mills Fleet Farm in Mason City on Monday and an employee brought him an electric wheelchair to use while in the store. Mr. Zahn, a Garner resident, said he normally has a manual wheelchair with him unless he knows he’s going to a store that provides an electric one. But upon leaving the store, he said an employee demanded he return the wheelchair before proceeding to the parking lot. “After I got out of the store, right in front of the door I was told I was not allowed to take the wheelchair out to the parking lot, and I said ‘huh?’ ” Mr. Zahn told KIMT. “I said, ‘I’ve done this before.’ She said, ‘the wheel chair is to not be out, it needs to come back in.’ I said, ‘what am I supposed to do, crawl out of the store?’ “ But that’s exactly what Mr. Zahn did, according to a video he posted on Facebook that’s been viewed more than 9.5 million times. “I was like ‘whoa’ and it was like, ‘do I make a scene or do I just leave?’ And it’s just best to leave, and I had my son video record it so that way I had proof of what happened,” he said. In his Facebook post, shared more than 115,000 times, Mr. Zahn wrote that he returned all his paid-for items once he realized he was going to have to crawl out of the store. “Just trying to make people aware of how Fleet Farm treats handicapped customers,” he wrote. Mills Fleet Farm has apologized for the incident, saying the employee who took away the cart made “the wrong decision.” CEO Wayne Sales told KIMT that while the company does have policies regarding the electric carts being used in parking lots, there is no policy that outright denies people access to the carts “as it appears in this situation.” A statement from Mr. Sales was also posted on the company’s Facebook page Tuesday. “While use of carts in the parking lot with the uneven terrain can pose a hazard, we feel that in this instance our team member made the wrong decision,” he said. “We apologize to the customer and to everyone who may be affected. “Mills Fleet Farm has been a part of lives of Midwesterners for more than 61 years. Here, we did not live up to the values or the service our customers have come to expect from us,” he continued. “We should have gone the extra mile and helped the customer use the cart to return to his vehicle after shopping. Our goal is to speak with the customer and make things right for him. What occurred is in no way reflective of our values, and we will use the incident to learn and to improve our services.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Yale grad students begin ‘symbolic’ hunger strike for benefits
.B
A group of Yale University graduate students are engaged in a “symbolic” hunger strike — rumbling stomachs may be filled with food — for better benefits. Student union Local 33 began a “collective fast” in front of University President Peter Salovey’s home on Tuesday.

Trump to pull feds out of K-12 education
.B
President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to start pulling the federal government out of K-12 education, following through on a campaign promise to return school control to state and local officials. The order, dubbed the “Education Federalism Executive Order,” will launch a 300-day review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts and directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to modify or repeal measures she deems an overreach by the federal government. “For too long the government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,” Mr. Trump said. “My administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab and give power back to families, cities [and] states — give power back to localities.” He said that previous administrations had increasingly forced schools to comply with “whims and dictates” from Washington, but his administration would break the trend. “We know local communities know it best and do it best,” said Mr. Trump, who was joined by several Republican governors for the signing. “The time has come to empower teachers and parents to make the decisions that help their students achieve success.” Ms. DeVos and Vice President Mike Pence were on hand for the ceremony, which was attended by about 25 people, including teachers, lawmakers and the governors. The executive order is not expected to have an immediate impact on school districts. Policy changes will follow a report on the findings of the review. The review will be spearheaded by the Department of Education’s Regulatory Review Task Force, according to the order. Ms. DeVos already has authority to modify or repeal regulations that are deemed a violation of federal law. The order, however, creates a review for identifying those areas and makes clear her mandate from the president to take action. Reducing the federal government’s role in K-12 is part of Mr. Trump’s reform agenda, which also includes the expansion of school choice programs. Among those at the signing ceremony were Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Gary Herbert of Utah, Paul LePage of Maine, Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Terry Branstad of Iowa, who also is Mr. Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China. Also in attendance were Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the Republican chairs of the two chambers’ education committees.

How Team Trump plans to kill Obama’s Paris climate deal by declaring it a treaty
.B
As President Trump’s top advisers prepare to hash out a final policy on the Paris climate agreement dumped onto their laps by President Obama, another option has hit the table: Declare the deal a treaty and send it to the Senate to be killed. The treaty option could emerge as the middle ground in the increasingly tense battle between “remainers” on the one hand, who say the president should abide by Mr. Obama’s global warming deal, and the Paris agreement’s detractors, who say Mr. Trump would be breaking a key campaign promise if he doesn’t withdraw from the pact. Mr. Trump’s principal advisers are slated to meet Thursday to hash out a final set of recommendations for the president, with several deadlines looming next month. At an initial meeting of top staffers Tuesday, several memos and letters that were circulated laid out the options, including the treaty proposal put forth by Christopher C. Horner and Marlo Lewis Jr., senior fellows at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Under their vision, Mr. Trump could toss out Mr. Obama’s decision that the Paris accord was an executive agreement, declare it a treaty and send it to the Senate, where it would need a two-thirds vote for ratification. Given Republican control of the chamber, the agreement’s opponents say senators would either shelve the deal or outright defeat it. Either option would derail the deal, the memo suggested. “That option affirms that we are a nation of laws, not men and, importantly, discourages both our negotiating partners and future U.S. officials against attempting to circumvent our system,” the memo says. A briefing paper circulated among Republican senators this week said the deal should have been sent to Capitol Hill by Mr. Obama, but he “knew that Congress would never approve such a flawed deal, so he refused to seek the Senate’s advice and consent.” Supporters of the Paris accord have their own memo drafted by lawyers in the State Department. That memo says that by sending the agreement to the Senate, the president would be giving up important powers and leave Mr. Trump and his successors open to congressional meddling. “Because the large majority of international agreements concluded by the United States are concluded as executive agreements, this could have far-reaching implications for our conduct of foreign affairs,” the State Department document says. The Paris agreement is the main international vehicle for trying to combat climate change. Mr. Obama committed the U.S. to the deal in 2015 but never submitted it for ratification, saying it was an extension of a U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which the Senate ratified in 1992. The State Department memo says there are few risks to remaining part of the Paris deal. It says the “legal obligations are relatively few and are generally process-oriented [and] discretionary in their application or repeat existing obligations already contained in the Framework Convention.” Michael McKenna, a Republican energy strategist, said anything short of withdrawal would leave the U.S. open to legal challenges, with judges potentially attempting to enforce strict climate limits based on the commitments. “The president is being asked to travel a path that leads him — ultimately — to continue the Obama administration policies on climate change,” said Mr. McKenna, who has authored his own memo calling for withdrawal. He blamed Obama administration “holdovers” at the State Department for trying to preserve their former boss’ plans. Mr. Obama committed the U.S. to cutting greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The former president tried to enforce the commitment through a series of executive and administration actions, imposing tight limits on power plants and auto emissions. Federal courts have halted some of those plans, and Mr. Trump and Congress have nixed others, easing the pressure on American industry. During the campaign, Mr. Trump also pledged to cancel the Paris deal. As a decision nears, the sides among Mr. Trump’s top advisers have become clear. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday appeared to join the remainers, though he said the deal should be renegotiated. “I’m not going to tell the president of the United States to walk away from the Paris accord,” Mr. Perry said at a conference sponsored by Bloomberg. “I will say that we need to renegotiate it.” Mr. Perry said other countries are breaking their self-imposed commitments, giving the U.S. an opportunity to insist on changes. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is a remainer, as are perhaps Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. The White House general counsel’s office also appears to be leaning toward remain, sources familiar with the negotiations said. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is pushing for withdrawal, and he is joined by U.N. Ambassador Nikki R. Haley, analysts said. Top presidential strategist Stephen K. Bannon is also a withdrawal advocate. Exxon Mobil Corp. has written a letter urging the administration to stick with the Paris agreement, and the National Mining Association said this week, after its leaders met with Mr. Pruitt, that it will push for withdrawal, Politico reported. The next test for the Paris accord will be in the middle of May, when finance ministers of the Group of Seven major economies meet in Italy. The heads of state meet at the end of the month. The leaders are hoping for a communique reaffirming the Paris agreement, while opponents within the U.S. are hoping to prevent that, saying it would tie Mr. Trump’s hands going forward.

Page says he’s the victim of ‘horrendous civil rights violations’
.B
Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page said Thursday he’s a victim of a civil rights crime. “I’ve been the victim of one of the most horrendous civil rights violations in recent U.S. election history,” Mr. Page said on CNN. Mr. Page was investigated last year for his connections to Russian officials, and his name was in the leaked dossier concerning the Trump team’s ties to Russia. The FBI recently obtained a warrant for Mr. Page’s communications after leaving the Trump campaign, arguing there was enough probable cause to obtain the warrant. “There is no probable cause, and there could be no probable cause based on anything I’ve ever done with Russia or any Russian person,” Mr. Page said. He said he has not been more forthcoming with information because of his concerns of breaking confidentiality. “I don’t like to discuss confidential dealings. I don’t want to create any issues for people,” Mr. Page said. President Trump and the administration have denied Mr. Page had any direct contact with Mr. Trump and was not a formal adviser to the campaign. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Fox woes continue as Kelly Wright, black anchor, sues for race discrimination
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Fox News is on a rolling, plunging, rocky ride of late, with all the sexual harassment allegations, suits, settlements, claim and the rest — and now, this. Black anchor Kelly Wright has joined a handful of former and present staffers accusing the cable outlet of racial discrimination. He’s the only black male anchor at Fox; he announced his intent to file separate charges during a press conference with his attorney, Doug Wigdor. He also announced he was joining the separate race discrimination suit filed by a dozen other plaintiffs against Fox, alleging race discrimination as well. “This hurts,” Wright said, the Blaze reported. “This hurts. I am here reluctantly because I prefer sitting behind an anchor desk delivering news to you, the viewer — reporting, delivering the news. … I am here reluctantly because I am not against any man or woman at Fox News. The truth is I admire, I like and even love the people who I work with and for. But I don’t like what they do.” Gulp. Here comes the stunner. Wright first made clear that he’s not joined forces with any left-wing organization to try and take down Fox. He also added his belief that Fox would continue to grow and thrive, due in large part to the millions of watchers who trust in the company mission. And then this: “But when that trust is broken with various employees because of racial bias, something has to be done.” So what’d Wright personally experience at Fox that met the criteria, he believed, for racial discrimination? Wigdor stepped in to explain. “Mr. [Bill] O’Reilly would not permit Mr. Wright to come on his show to discuss how America could focus on achieving racial reconciliation in the midst of growing racial hostility,” the attorney said. “Instead, Mr. O’Reilly told Mr. Wright that he should call up Roger Ailes and Bill Shine and offer to sing the national anthem at the Fox News town hall. Rather than viewing Mr. Wright as the two-time Emmy award recipient he is, Mr. O’Reilly saw Mr. Wright as a singing entertainer.” Wright was later asked to appear on O’Reilly’s news talk show to discuss the Ferguson, Missouri, racial upsets and divide. At that time, Wright asked O’Reilly to show “Beyond the Dream,” a series of stories about positive contributions blacks have made to their communities. “Mr. O’Reilly refused because it showed blacks in too positive a light,” Wigdor said, the Blaze reported, “declaring that he, Mr. O’Reilly, knew black America better than anyone.” Fox has denied the allegations in Wright’s suit, as well as the charges contained in the previous race discrimination suit filed by a dozen other plaintiffs.And the company, through a spokesperson, vowed to “vigorously defend these cases.” Woe is Fox, though. And woe are conservatives across the country who have watched with growing alarm the seeming endless allegations of sexual harassment against big names at the one outlet that used to represent the free-market, small-government side of arguments — and now this.

Trump to be first president since Reagan to personally address NRA convention
.B
Gun rights activists rallied to candidate Donald Trump in ways unprecedented in modern politics, and as president Mr. Trump is about to repay them with a personal speech this week at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention. He becomes the first sitting president to appear since Ronald Reagan, and Second Amendment advocates say they are likely to give him a hero’s welcome, praising the change in attitude at the top of the administration, the Supreme Court pick of Justice Neil Gorsuch and other moves. “If I had to grade him based upon everything that’s on his plate that he has to deal with, I’d have to give him an A,” said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. “There’s no doubt that he calmed the fears of gun owners around the country that the federal government [will] be used as a tool to take their constitutionally protected rights away. I mean, there’s no two ways about that.” The NRA, in somewhat of a surprise move, endorsed Mr. Trump at its convention last year — months before he formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination. The group was one of Mr. Trump’s largest outside backers in terms of TV air support and advocacy. It marked a stunning turnaround for Mr. Trump, who in 2000 said he supported stricter firearms controls, then turned into one of the fiercest opponents of those controls as a presidential candidate. “This president ran as the most pro-Second Amendment, pro-individual freedom candidate in the history of the country, and if you look at how he’s governed over the first 100 days, he’s arguably been the most effective and most successful in the first hundred days of any presidency,” Chris Cox, the head of the NRA’s lobbying arm, said in a recent appearance on Fox News. More than 80,000 NRA members are anticipated at this year’s convention in Atlanta. In addition to Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke are also slated to address the NRA Institute for Legislative Action’s leadership forum on Friday. But Mr. Trump is undoubtedly the main attraction, and his appearance at the conference sends a solid message to gun owners, said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “He courted gun owners, and sometimes you get courted by politicians and then once they’re elected you’re” forgotten, Mr. Van Cleave said. “The fact that he’s going to the convention is just one more indication that when he’s saying something, he means it.” Gun control groups are just as energized and are vowing to oppose Mr. Trump at every turn. They are organizing a rally in Atlanta for Saturday, the day after the president’s expected speech. The groups said they are preparing to try to stop NRA-led initiatives such as national reciprocity for concealed-carry permits obtained in one state. “The extremist leadership of the NRA spent $30 million for a seat at the table in the White House, and they are doing everything they can to get a return on that investment,” said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights backers have big hopes for Mr. Trump, though early efforts have been modest. The president did sign into law a repeal of Obama-era regulations that would have required the Social Security Administration to scour its records for people with mental deficiencies and who were deemed unable to handle their finances and flag them as potential dangers who must be blocked by the national background check database. Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, applauded Mr. Zinke’s move to lift an Obama-era ban on using lead ammunition on certain federal lands. “President Trump has done more for gun rights in his first 100 days than any president in recent memory,” Mr. Pratt said. “Moving forward, we hope that whatever Obamacare ‘fix’ he pushes, it will prevent insurance companies, doctors and the ATF from furthering a gun control agenda.” Gun rights groups spent much of the past eight years trying to derail attempts by Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats to impose further restrictions on gun purchases, to expand background checks to cover personal sales or trades and to limit ammunition magazine capacity. But Americans, fearful of harsher restrictions, rushed to stock up, setting purchase records in what became known as the Obama gun boom. Early evidence suggests that the buying spree has been curtailed with Mr. Trump in office. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Drugged driving more prevalent in fatal car crashes than drunk driving: Report
.B
Drivers killed in fatal car crashes are now more likely to be on drugs than drunk, according to a report published Wednesday, prompting its authors to demand lawmakers “do something” about the uptick of drug-related casualties. Fewer drunk drivers were killed in automobile accidents in 2015 than drivers who tested positive for drugs, the Governors Highway Safety Association and the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility said in Wednesday’s report. Forty-three percent of drivers tested after fatal crashes that year had drugs in their system, compared to 37 percent who tested above the legal limit for alcohol consumption, the report said, citing data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System, FARS. “We have new data that show drugs are more prevalent to drivers than alcohol is for the first time,” Jim Hedlund, a former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official and author of the report, told CBS News. Of the drivers killed with drugs in their system, 36.5 percent tested positive for marijuana, according to the data. Amphetamine, or speed, was the second-most prevalent at 9.3 percent. “We have a drug crisis in this country. I think that’s clearly evident and it’s impacting traffic safety,” Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the GHSA, told West Virginia’s Metro News. According to the report’s authors, the findings show a clear and present need for law enforcement to detect and deter drugged driving. With drivers experimenting with hundreds of different drugs, however, police continue to wrestle with understanding the affects of various substances in addition to identifying the signs and symptoms of subsequently induced impairment. “Officers need to know more than they do for alcohol how to suspect drug impairment, and know that it can exhibit itself in different ways,” Mr. Hedlund told the Duluth News Tribune. “Drug impairment has different signs and symptoms — think of the difference between uppers and downers. “As states across the country continue to struggle with drug-impaired driving, it’s critical that we help them understand the current landscape and provide examples of best practices so they can craft the most effective countermeasures,” Mr. Adkins said. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is illegal in all 50 states. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Climate change is torturing allergy sufferers
.B
For local nasal allergy sufferers, the damp, rainy weather over the past couple of days has been a respite from high levels of tree and flower pollen. But with temperatures continuing to rise year to year, longer spells of warm weather mean increased pollen counts and a prolonged allergy season for the future. “Washington, D.C., is one of many, many cities in the central and southern and eastern U.S. that have one of their warmest years, starts to the year on record,” said Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist for Weather.com and The Weather Channel. Mr. Erdman said the general consensus is that with a warming climate over the next several decades, pollen season will lengthen across much of the country. “We get more carbon dioxide in the air that makes plants more efficient at producing pollen and growing faster,” he said. “This is just one of the things we’re going to have to deal with going forward.” Researchers estimate that about 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from nasal allergies, which affect as many as 30 percent of adults and 40 percent of children, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Pollen from blooming trees — particularly birch, oak and cedar — is the culprit for nasal allergies in the spring; ragweed is the leading contributor to hay fever in the fall. Across the U.S., spring arrived about three weeks earlier than typical, according to data from the USA National Phenology Network, a research consortium on seasonal phenomena. And researchers are trying to evaluate how warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels affect the environment and humans. A 2010 report by the National Wildlife Federation asserted that “unchecked global warming will worsen respiratory allergies,” more airborne allergens will increase asthma attacks and poison ivy “grows faster and is more toxic” with increased levels of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, scientists have recorded stabilized global emissions of carbon dioxide between 2013 and 2015 — a promising trend, considering that CO2 levels in 2013 surpassed 400 parts per million, the highest amount ever recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 20 million Americans over the past year diagnosed with rhinitis, or hay fever, our bodies’ rejection of pollen in the air. Symptoms include sneezing, runny nose and red, watery eyes — a nuisance for many, but they can develop into serious respiratory infections for an unlucky few, especially children. The CDC counted 7.4 million children with respiratory allergies in the past 12 months. And data from the National Health Survey from 1997 to 2011 show that respiratory allergies are the most common type of allergy among children. For Dr. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Virginia, it’s not the uptick in new allergy cases that worries her but the increased severity of allergies in patients she already sees. She has noticed a trend in her patients needing multiple medications to control their symptoms. “Kids are requiring a lot of medication for their allergies, the kids that I’m seeing now, there’s not many of them that can be treated with one medication, most of the kids I’m seeing are requiring two, three or four medications to control their allergies,” Dr. Ahdoot said. She noted the case of one boy who was recently prescribed an inhaler and already was four other medications including a nasal spray, an oral antihistamine and an inhaled steroid. He had to be prescribed an oral steroid. Dr. Ahdoot is a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a member of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. The consortium warns that climate change negatively affects humans’ health. “Some kids have minor sniffles and is not a big deal,” Dr. Ahdoot said. “But some have significant nasal congestion, eye irritation and itching that makes them quite miserable. They get sent home from school, have to go to the doctor’s, can’t play outside, and have to take multiple medications.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Ex-spy admits anti-Trump dossier unverified, blames Buzzfeed for publishing
.B
Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the infamous anti-Donald Trump dossier, acknowledges that a sensational charge his sources made about a tech company CEO and Democratic Party hacking is unverified. In a court filing, Mr. Steele also says his accusations against the president and his aides about a supposed Russian hacking conspiracy were never supposed to be made public, much less posted in full on a website for the world to see on Jan. 10. He defends himself by saying he was betrayed by his client and that he followed proper internal channels by giving the dossier to Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, to alert the U.S. government. SEE ALSO: Inside the court case of Christopher Steele's Trump dossier Mr. Steele has not spoken publicly about his disputed opposition research project, but for the first time he is being forced to talk in a London court through his attorneys. Barristers for Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence firm filed their first defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by Aleksej Gubarev, chief executive of the network solutions firm XBT Holdings. Mr. Steele acknowledges that the part of the 35-page dossier that identified Mr. Gubarev as a rogue hacker came from “unsolicited intelligence” and “raw intelligence” that “needed to be analyzed and further investigated/verified.” Democrats in Washington have embraced the unproven dossier as an argument for appointing a high-powered commission to investigate President Trump and his aides. In his final December dossier memo — his 16th — Mr. Steele accused Mr. Gubarev and his web-hosting companies of hacking the Democratic Party computer networks with pornography and bugging devices. Mr. Gubarev calls the charge fiction and filed a lawsuit in February. Mr. Steele’s court filing portrays him as a victim of Fusion GPS — the Washington firm that hired him with money from a Hillary Clinton backer. Fusion specializes in opposition research for Democrats and circulated the Steele dossier among reporters in an effort to injure the Trump candidacy and presidency. Mr. Steele said he never authorized Fusion to do that. “The defendants did not  provide any of the pre-election memoranda to media organizations or journalists. Nor did they authorize anyone to do so,” Mr. Steele said through his attorney. “Nor did they provide the confidential December memorandum to media organizations or journalists. Nor did they authorize anyone to do so.” “At all material times Fusion was subject to an obligation not to disclose to third parties confidential intelligence material provided” by Mr. Steele and his firm Orbis, the court filing reads. Mr. Steele personally signed the seven-page filing. He is represented by two London barristers who specialize in defamation cases: Gavin Millar and Edward Craven. Mr. Steele says the ultimate responsibility lies with BuzzFeed, the liberal news website whose editor, Ben Smith, decided to post the entire 35 pages — memos from June to December — on Jan. 10 even though Mr. Smith said he doubted the far-flung accusations were true. That momentous web posting sent Mr. Steele into hiding. He re-emerged March 7 in London, made a brief statement to the press and went inside his Orbis office. The Steele dossier’s major charge is that the Trump campaign entered into an elaborate conspiracy with Russian agents to hack Democratic Party computers. The Trump White House denies the charge, as do at least four people whom Mr. Steele’s unidentified sources accused of breaking the law. The final Steele memo in December targets Mr. Gubarev and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney. That memo, after accusing Mr. Gubarev, then recounts from previous memos a supposed trip Mr. Cohen took to Prague in late August to meet with Russian agents and devise a plan to cover up the purported Trump team’s role in the hacking. Mr. Cohen calls the dossier “fabricated.” He has shown that he was in California at the time and has never been to Prague. He told The Washington Times that he has instructed his attorneys to investigate a lawsuit against Mr. Steele. The fact that Mr. Steele acknowledges that he put unverified “raw intelligence” into his December memo casts further doubt on his research techniques for the entire 35-page dossier. Although Mr. Steele portrays himself as a victim of Fusion and BuzzFeed, he acknowledges in his court filing that he provided “off-the-record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda in late summer/autumn 2016.” The narration of the involvement of Mr. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, reads like a spy novel. Andrew Wood is a former British ambassador to Moscow and is an associate at the Orbis firm. After the Nov. 8 presidential election, Mr. Wood met with Mr. McCain and David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state who is director of human rights and democracy at The McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University. By that time, Mr. Steele had written 15 memos for the dossier. As a result, Mr. Wood arranged for Mr. Kramer to meet with Mr. Steele “in order to show him the pre-election memoranda on a confidential basis,” the court filing says. The meeting occurred on Nov. 28 in Surrey, England. “Mr. Kramer told [Mr. Steele] the intelligence he had gathered raised issues of potential national security importance,” the court filing says. Mr. Kramer returned to Washington, and Fusion agreed to give a hard copy of the dossier to Mr. McCain “on a confidential basis via Mr. Kramer,” according to the filing. Mr. McCain then asked Mr. Steele, through Mr. Kramer, to provide any additional information on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence officially has concluded that Russia directed a hacking operation into Democratic Party email servers and orchestrated the release of stolen emails via WikiLeaks to help the Trump campaign. Mr. McCain has confirmed publicly that he personally turned over the dossier to FBI Director James B. Comey. But at that time, the FBI already had obtained the dossier from other sources and had been using it to investigate the supposed Trump-Russia connection. Afterward, Mr. Steele continued to receive “raw intelligence,” including the Gubarev accusations. He wrote the December memo after his work for Fusion had ended. He provided that memo to British national security officials and to Fusion through an “enciphered email,” with instructions to provide a copy to Mr. McCain. The court filing says Mr. Steele has worked with Fusion for “a number of years” and was hired in June to begin investigating Mr. Trump. It was in June when the Democratic National Committee disclosed publicly that it had been hacked and its cybersleuths singled out Russia as the likely culprit. Mr. Steele does not mention another American contact he made: The New York Times reported that the FBI, during an October meeting in Rome, offered him $50,000 to continue investigating Mr. Trump. Presumedly, Mr. Steele would continue to investigate the president as a surrogate for the FBI. The deal, however, did not go through. Some Republicans have questioned why the FBI would try to put a Democratic-paid opposition researcher on the payroll, especially one who produced a dossier that remains unproven. The Times said the FBI wanted Mr. Steele to provide more proof of his charges. Mr. Gubarev also is suing BuzzFeed for libel in Florida, where XBT has an office and where his firm Webzilla is incorporated. The lawsuit calls BuzzFeed’s posting “one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern journalism.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Chris Cox: NRA helped save ‘the soul of America’ in 2016
.B
ATLANTA — Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s legislative-lobbying arm, on Friday thanked gun-rights activists for their advocacy in the 2016 election, saying they “saved the soul of America” and “altered the course of history” in helping propel President Trump into the White House. “You should be proud, because this organization made the difference and saved the soul of America,” Mr. Cox said. “We didn’t just swing an election. We altered the course of history.” Mr. Cox recounted how the NRA was, at times, the only outside group really supporting Mr. Trump last year. The NRA gave Mr. Trump its earliest-ever presidential endorsement at its convention in Louisville last year and spent some $30 million supporting him and opposing Hillary Clinton. “You kept your focus where it mattered: protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States,” Mr. Cox said. He was helping kick off the 2017 NRA Institute for Legislative Action’s “Leadership Forum” on Friday at the gun-rights group’s annual meetings, held in Atlanta this year. Mr. Trump is the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to speak at the NRA’s annual convention. “He wasn’t the establishment’s candidate, and he sure wasn’t the media’s candidate,” Mr. Cox said. “He was our candidate: the most proudly pro-Second Amendment nominee in American history.” Mr. Cox said he spoke to Mr. Trump shortly after the inauguration, and said that “he wanted me to thank all of you.” Mr. Cox said that amid the dust-up over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd he told the president that “the only number that mattered was the number of people who watched Hillary Clinton’s inauguration —- zero.” Mr. Cox also said, though, that “the fight is far from over,” saying that “we can and we will” make Congress pass national concealed carry reciprocity legislation, a longstanding goal of gun-rights groups. “Let us vow on this day that November was more than a temporary moment,” he said. “It was a permanent political red line for every would-be holder of power: if you run against the Second Amendment freedom of everyday American citizens, you put your future in direct opposition to the most powerful grassroots force in history,” he said. Some 80,000 NRA members were expected to attend the convention this year. Other scheduled speakers at Friday’s event include Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, and Milwaukee County, Wisc. Sheriff David Clarke. GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Roy Blunt of Missouri also addressed the crowd via videotaped messages.

An epidemic of TDS in the Marx Bros. media
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Just about the time the fever on the nut left seems to be subsiding there’s another outbreak of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Normal-looking folk who sound like they escaped a Marx Bros. movie fall into a relapse. The bombshell that Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s chief source of intelligence, was guilty of “unmasking” Trump campaigners identified in intelligence findings, unhinged several commentators on the television networks. Colleagues and bystanders couldn’t decide whether to call security or medics. The Chicken Noodle Network demonstrated why it has fallen on hard times, saying it would not report bad news about its favorite political personalities. “Let us be very clear about this,” said Don Lemon, one of CNN’s star news readers and part-time house dick. “There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump team  was spied on illegally. There is no evidence that backs up the president’s original claim. And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you [with] a diversion.” Mr. Lemon’s viewers who want to know would have to go to another channel for another investigator. At MSNBC, the leading television network on Planet Pluto, Chris Matthews was more than willing to talk about the bombshell but first he had to find someone to help him get a grip. The bug that crawls up his leg when he thinks about Barack Obama was biting again. When he thought about it, he was sure that the Rice bombshell, with the implication that whatever U.S. intelligence sources had picked up about the Trump campaign had been passed on to the Insurrection, was fake news the new president was pushing to distract attention from the investigations into contacts, if any, between Mr. Trump and the Russians. “Why is [the president] going after Susan Rice?” he demanded of no one present. “It’s like he pulls out — he’s like an old [disc jockey]. He pulls out old records from 20 years ago and plays them again.” Then he played video clips from three Republican senators — Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — raising questions about Miss Rice’s behavior, and read a tweet from Mike Huckabee speculating about Susan Rice in an orange prison jump suit. Sen. Cotton called her Typhoid Mary, for showing up every time there was a scandal or shame in the Obama administration. “Oh, God,” cried David Corn, a guest panelist. “I mean,” said Chris, “Huckabee has no shame. These guys are trooping along, like camp followers of Trump.” Piped up another guest, one Simon Marks: “They’re looking for a pinata. They found one in Susan Rice. I do think — “ Chris allows no thinking on his show, so he cut him off in midsentence. “Notice it’s a female. Just a thought.” (Only Chris is permitted an occasional random thought.) “Well, said Simon Marks, trying to get back in the conversation, “that’s true. That’s also true. But I do think she slightly played into her hand — into their hands. “Typhoid Mary?” asked Chris. Well, no. Mr. Marks was talking about Susan Rice. Chris does not always pay attention when someone else is talking. He interrupted again. “Susan Rice’s job is to watch national security,” Chris said, apparently unaware that Susan Rice hasn’t had that job since America changed presidents. There’s not only a new president, but a new adviser with the job of “watching national security.” But then Chris wanted to talk about the movies. He suggested that Susan Rice, or maybe it was Tom Cotton or Mike Huckabee, he wasn’t sure, had been living in the Bates Motel, with a deranged killer from the famous Alfred Hitchcock movie “Psycho.” Chris watches a lot of movies and sometimes has trouble keeping the characters straight. Then it was off for a history lesson. The Trump family, particularly First Daughter Ivanka Trump Kushner, reminds him of the Romanovs, the Imperial Russian family slain by revolutionaries in 1917. Trump Derangement Syndrome apparently encourages fantasies about assassinations. A columnist for The Washington Post seemed to observe not long ago that assassinations often put an end to unhappy eras. Treating Trump Derangement Syndrome is not easy. Dr. Quackenbush, the celebrated physician would tell you that we must be patient, because there will be episodes of intense derangement, and then the affliction subsides, only to flare again. The confirmation this week of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to unhinge Chris, David and Don again. Dr. Quackenbush, who achieved celluloid immortality in the Marx Brothers movie “A Day at the Races,” was trained to doctor horses, and he would know which end of Chris and the guys to examine. If only he were here. • Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Remember when the establishment thought Trump was crazy?
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Remind me again: Who is the impulsive, trigger-happy pugnacious brute who cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes? It’s Donald Trump, according to universal bipartisan proclamations from establishment Washington lifers who broke into such hysterics over a gauche real estate titan who thought he could do their job better than them. These people should know, considering they are the same people who have managed to keep America at a constant state of war for about 15 years now. These people cannot agree on pretty much anything else. But spending gobs of money policing the world with never-ending foreign wars? They suddenly break out in hot pulsating bipartisanship. So perhaps it should come as little surprise that these people who so loathed Donald Trump the candidate are so thrilled with Donald Trump the president for firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian civil war that American voters are pretty adamant about staying out of. The sudden applause for Mr. Trump came from the strangest corners of the political world. The Senate’s “renegade” rogue Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham — ardent foes of Mr. Trump during the campaign — commended him for his warrior bluster. “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,” they said. “For that, he deserves the support of the American people.” Even Sen. Marco Rubio — famously dubbed “Little Marco” — cheered the president for “acting decisively.” “President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,” Little Marco said. Across the aisle, even Democrats were gushing over the expensive military intervention. “Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer enthused. Even Hillary Clinton hopped aboard the Trump Train for bombing Syria. Her only complaint seemed to be that Mr. Trump may not have gone far enough. “I believe that we should have, and still should, take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them,” she said. This is the same Hillary Clinton who warned us in the most alarming terms during the campaign that under no circumstances should Mr. Trump be trusted with America’s war-making arsenal. “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she said last summer. “It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” Well, apparently Syrian dictator Bashar Assad got under Mr. Trump’s very thin skin, and Mrs. Clinton’s only complaint now is he didn’t go far enough. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

Melania Trump’s official portrait sparks liberal outrage
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Trump Derangement Syndrome is real, folks. The latest example is the liberal reaction to first lady Melania Trump’s official portrait, which was unveiled on Monday. Cosmopolitan Magazine declared the photo was heavily airbrushed — Cosmo, of all sources, which heavily airbrushes many of its scantily clad cover models every month. Mrs. Trump’s face “appeared to be heavily airbrushed,” the women’s magazine lamented, adding a bit of snark: “This soft lighting is like only the classiest ‘90s mall glamour shot photo could offer!” Wire service Agence France-Presse reported: “Melania Trump portrait stirs controversy,” which was then carried and featured on the front-page of Yahoo News on Tuesday. “While some commenters gushed that the first lady was ‘beyond beautiful’ and ‘gorgeous,’ others mocked the image as highly airbrushed and compared the gauzy background — a window in the White House residence — to 1990s school portrait settings,” AFP reported. Former Comedy Central “The Nightly Show” writer Sasha Stewart wrote on Twitter, “Anyone know why Melania Trump’s portrait was taken in front of the Muppet Babies window?” The Hollywood Reporter took offense Mrs. Trump wore her wedding ring in the picture. “Melania Trump’s official White House portrait puts her 15-carat wedding ring front and center,” its headline blared, adding: “Compared to Michelle Obama’s first official portrait first portrait, which shows the former first lady in the now-famous sleeveless Michael Kors dress in the Blue Room of the White House in 2009, Melania’s portrait has an almost surreal glow about it, not unlike a mall glamour shot. The air of perfection, however, might just be a result of her prior experience as a professional model. We’ll never know.” The U.K.’s Daily Express also took note of her ring, saying she was “flaunting an ENORMOUS diamond ring” and “chose to flaunt her wealth, power and status in her first official portrait as First Lady.” You know what I think? So what? The picture’s gorgeous, and her ring is beautiful. She and her husband made no secret of their wealth when Mr. Trump ran for office, so why are we shocked now? There’s no reason. Unless you’re looking to nitpick. Unless you detest Mr. Trump and his presidency so much, nothing is off limits, including his criticism of his wife. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome. And unfortunately, I think it’s an incurable disease for many in the media. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Controlling the nation’s internet
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Do you remember the last time you had an issue with your internet connection and the federal government cheerfully helped you resolve it? Me neither. Yet the same federal government who spent $2 billion on a website that was more likely to dish out electric shocks than work properly is now literally in control of our nation’s internet, under the false rubric of promoting “net neutrality.” Since 1996, the internet had been designated as “information services” and left unregulated. But under the Obama administration’s 2015 FCC order, the internet was redefined as a “common carrier,” putting it under the thumb of Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, the Depression-era law that kept our nation’s telegraphs and rotary phones humming. The core concepts of true net neutrality are simple. They include no blocking of information or resources, no intentional slowing or reduction in available bandwidth, no “pay to play” allocation of higher speeds, and protection of consumers’ online privacy. There’s broad agreement on these principles, the crucial difference is how we enforce them. The open, fair, and innovative internet we’ve all come to rely on got where it is today through market forces, not government oversight and regulation. It was consumers who sorted out the winners (Facebook, Mozilla, Google) from the losers (MySpace, Netscape, Pets.com) and that’s exactly as it should be. The internet has worked because it remained largely a democratic free-market, unsullied by an overarching government scheme. The internet now will be dripping with government scheme, as Title II regulates internet providers as it would a monopolistic utility from 80 years ago. Government’s heavy hand is already wreaking damage by throttling the investments which help fuel the engine of innovation. Since the Title II order went into effect, investment in broadband has gone down each quarter — a first. This has led to providers having to slow expansion, upgrades, and new services for their customers, reversing the trend of the internet giving us more content, better service, faster speeds, at less cost. Consumers lose with government regulating the internet like a utility, but big content providers like Google, Facebook and Netflix love it because they win no matter what rules the government imposes on our modems or local internet providers. Title II limits its regulations to service, not content, seemingly oblivious to the reality that content relies entirely on broadband infrastructure and service technology. Before the FCC chose to butt-in, the FTC capably protected consumers from unfair competition and deceptive practices. They successfully took multiple companies, including Google, to court for various transgressions. There is no reason why this enforcement mechanism cannot continue to serve consumer interests. With new technologies on the horizon that will provide unprecedented speeds, processing power, and opportunities for innovation, it is critical that we return to a free-market framework of limited regulation which allowed the internet to become the powerful tool of innovation and economic transformation it is today. Repealing the current stifling rules will unleash a flood of online investment, experimentation, and innovation. Grave concern over the government regulating the internet is even shared by the very person who coined the term “net neutrality,” law professor Tim Wu, who worries that the FCC’s present rules gives government the power to shape “media policy, social policy, oversight of the political process, [and] issues free speech.” That is a frightening amount of power for the government to have, especially given their recent record of wholesale privacy violations. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it a priority to establish a policy framework that protects both consumers and the future of the internet. The key rests with Congress, who ought to work with Chairman Pai to see this vision become reality and endure as administrations come and go. Over time, the concerns about net neutrality, security, privacy, and free and fair competition will only grow more urgent. Now is the time to put workable rules in place that will definitively protect the interests of consumers and make sure the internet remains open to everyone. • Gerard Scimeca, a lawyer, is vice president of CASE, Consumer Action for a Strong Economy, based in Arlington, Virginia.

Why buying illegal drugs is immoral
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Purchasing illegal drugs is an immoral act, regardless of where one stands in the legalization debate. When drugs are legally prohibited, criminal organizations assume control of production and distribution, making violence inherent in the process. Drug proceeds are used to fund criminal and terrorist organizations, enabling them to murder innocent people, attack police and military, bleed our tax dollars, and destroy the rule of law. Drugs are a major source of income for terrorist groups and other criminal organizations, due to the high profit margins in these illegal markets. For example, one kilogram of heroin costs $2,500-$5,000 in Afghanistan and it sells for $60,000-$90,000 in the United States. That same kilogram is worth approximately $1.5 million after is it diluted and divided into individual dosage units. Profits made from illegal drug sales are also unreported income, allowing unlawful enterprises to remain in the shadows. There is a strong nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism. According to DEA’s FY2016 Performance Budget Congressional Submission, 22 of 59 designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations had possible ties to drug trafficking. This number is probably low, because evidence is difficult to obtain, and it doesn’t address two recently designated terrorist groups. As an example, Afghanistan produces most of the world’s opium, morphine, and heroin. In Afghanistan, drug producers, traffickers, and transporters have deep connections to the Taliban, Haqqani network, and other terrorist groups. Drug traffickers use terrorists for protection and terrorists use drug traffickers to fund their activities. Terrorism is not the only violence associated with drug trafficking. Criminal groups regularly commit crimes against humanity. For example, Mexican organized crime was responsible for an estimated 80,000 deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to a Congressional Research Service report on Mexican Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Organizations. Violent, transnational criminal gangs, such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) also fund their criminal activities through drug trafficking. Violence is inevitable in illegal activity, especially in businesses like drug trafficking that involve large sums of money. Criminal groups exist outside of the judicial system; therefore they have no recourse with police or in the courts when they are victimized by other groups. When a criminal group retaliates against another, it engages in forms of tribalism and anarchism, where justice is determined by those most willing to use force. Drug dealers become modern warlords, operating outside of accepted institutions and societal norms. Drugs are not the only unlawful trade that should be avoided. For example, illicit cigarette trafficking in the United States has been linked to terrorism funding. Numerous criminal investigations have shown that profits from some illicit cigarette sales support terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda. The Iran-backed Hezballah, which was designated by the U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997, has links to both untaxed cigarette sales and drug trafficking. Hezballah, which is also supported by Iran, is responsible for terrorist activities across the globe. While there are compelling arguments to legalize certain drugs, the policy argument needs to be divorced from the morality of purchasing illicit drugs. It’s ironic that many celebrities and public intellectuals call for boycotts against corporations, like Nike and Apple, because of the low pay and poor working conditions these companies offer workers overseas, but some of the same people also openly admit to buying marijuana illegally. They don’t see the hypocrisy of condemning businesses, while buying marijuana from Mexican drug cartels or heroin from the Taliban; both of which murder innocent people. They mistakenly justify the purchase of illegal drugs based on their belief that drugs should be legalized, while ignoring the fact that their actions subsidize murder. The next time one considers buying illegal drugs, one should consider that the money might be going to Hezballah, the Taliban, or a drug cartel. If one believes a specific drug should be legalized, then one should encourage legislators to change the law, not violate the law. Until the law is changed, illegal drug purchases will continue to support evil men who commit acts of violence against the innocent. • Jeffrey James Higgins is a retired DEA supervisory special agent, with 25 years of law enforcement experience, and an expert in narco-terrorism.

Challenging inaccurate information about guns
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: When you receive glowing media attention and have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, you don’t really have to debate. Michael Bloomberg just announced last week that he would be putting $25 million into next year’s House and Senate races. From 2013 to 2016, he donated $48 million toward congressional races. By contrast, the NRA contributed a measly $2.1 million. And Mr. Bloomberg spent about 85 percent more on lobbying, more on television advertising, and much more for state and local political races. Mr. Bloomberg’s groups, like other gun control organizations, usually have control over whom they debate on TV and radio. I know this from personal experience. On a half dozen occasions, I have been asked to appear on CNN or elsewhere, only to be canceled on because the representative from Mr. Bloomberg’s group didn’t want to appear with me on the show. I have even been told this as I was driving to the studio. All that the producers could give me was their sympathy. A couple of them even asked me if I could recommend someone to replace me. In April 2015, C-SPAN’s Washington Journal invited me to participate in a one-hour debate with Ted Alcorn, research director at Mr. Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety. Mr. Alcorn had already agreed to appear, but said he was unavailable as soon as the C-SPAN producer informed him of my participation. He said something had come up. When the producer suggested that the two of us could appear in separate, half-hour segments, his availability changed once again. However, he was only available for the half-hour segment after mine. Conveniently, that prevented me from responding to his points. I learned all of this from the C-SPAN producer, who encouraged me to let viewers know about Mr. Alcorn’s unwillingness to debate me. From the show transcript: Lott: “I was really disappointed that the people from Everytown — your producer said that I should mention this — weren’t willing to go on with me right now to discuss this. I think that the audience would gain a lot more from the give and take, where someone could make a claim, and the other person could rebut it. I am disappointed that they have continually refused to appear at the same time.” When Mr. Alcorn finally appeared on “Washington Journal,” the first caller asked him about his unwillingness to debate. Caller: “my first comment is that I think it is quite telling that the people who are opposed to gun rights refuse to appear on screen with Dr. Lott or other economists or criminologists … why is that?” After responding with a long discussion about how we “live in a moment when gun rights in the U.S. have an unprecedented level of protection,” Mr. Alcorn eventually got to his point. Alcorn: “When there’s a credible scientist — somebody who wants to have a real constructive conversation about this, we’re going to be there. But folks who seek to minimize the issue of gun violence, the grave issue of gun violence in this country or to draw attention away from the real issues to themselves — that’s not a conversation that I think is productive to be a part of.” I don’t minimize the issue of gun violence. I just disagree about what policies will effectively combat that violence. But Everytown can afford to make excuses and miss opportunities for debate. After all, they have massive resources and can count on the mainstream media to push their agenda. In my experience, only Fox News has stood its ground. Once more, Everytown refused to participate as soon as they learned that I would be appearing at the same time. But the show went on, and host John Stossel pointedly mentioned their unwillingness to participate. On literally hundreds of occasions, however, gun control advocates have refused to have a straight-up debate. Last November, popular Las Vegas talk show host Alan Stock tried to set up a debate about Mr. Bloomberg’s ballot initiative in Nevada on gun background checks. But a person working on the campaign reportedly told Mr. Stock that they would “only debate a local person who didn’t know as much about the issue.” Last month, the prestigious, bipartisan Texas Lyceum invited me to debate gun control issues. They asked Everytown, the Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center if they would participate. Once again, they refused. Mr. Bloomberg and his groups are unwilling because they don’t want viewers to see their inaccurate information being challenged. They would rather people just take their falsehoods at face value. • John R.

Donald Trump’s conflicting messages
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: One hundred plus days into his topsy-turvy presidency, Donald Trump and his administration are sending conflicting messages about the agenda he ran on in his 2016 campaign. In many cases, he appears to be backing away from the hard-core positions that appealed to his legions of cheering supporters who catapulted him into the White House. In recent weeks, President Trump and his advisers have abandoned key components of his plan to deport millions of illegal Hispanic immigrants, suggesting that many or even most of them will remain in this country. His campaign pledge to build “an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,” seems to be crumbling among Republicans on Capitol Hill. And it is now clear that his endlessly repeated promise to make Mexico pay the tens of billions of dollars the wall would cost to build isn’t worth the paper it was printed on. Instead, he’s pleading with Congress to include a billion dollar down payment in the 2017 federal budget that is now being taken up in the House. Meaning that taxpayers will foot the entire bill. Conservative talk show firebrand Rush Limbaugh, who was one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest supporters throughout his campaign, isn’t happy with the president’s flip-flop on this issue. Mr. Trump was “caving on his demand for a measly $1 billion in the budget for his wall on the border with Mexico,” Mr. Limbaugh told his radio audience this week. His switchboard lit up with angry phone calls. “I’m afraid he’s starting to dip his foot into the swamp,” said one caller. Another said he feared that Mr. Trump would just continue to “kick this can down the road.” Meantime, Republican congressional leaders are no longer talking about building a 2,200 mile wall. Instead, the talk is all about beefing up security along the border with drones and other surveillance gear and personnel. Even Mexico’s president Felipe Calderon is now saying nice things about Mr. Trump’s increasingly softer tone on the border issues. “I believe that the current administration after 100 days has been more moderate than was expected,” he said. “And I think we need to reinforce such behavior.” Mr. Trump ran flat out by repeatedly condemning China as a “currency manipulator,” but now says that designation no longer applies to them. He preached “America First” in his campaign, a political cry in World War II from Americans who opposed our entry into the war, urging that we retreat from institutions like NATO that he said had become obsolete. And he was critical of corporate welfare programs like the Export-Import Bank. But now he opposes Republican efforts to abolish the Ex-Im bank and stoutly defends membership in NATO, saying that a muscular Europe is “very, very important to me as president of the United States” and “very much to everybody’s advantage.” Perhaps nowhere is the administration’s backtracking more surprising, and confusing, than the growing internal debate about whether illegal immigrants, other than those who have committed crimes, should be deported. That debate has centered on “dreamers,” illegals who were brought here when they were very young by their parents. Many are now nearing their 20s and some are either attending colleges or expecting to enter soon. They come under the protective Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA program enacted under President Obama. In an interview with The Associated Press last Friday, Mr. Trump appeared to support the “dreamers” program, saying they should “rest easy” and not be concerned about deportation. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked about the president’s remark on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, he said, “There’s no doubt the president has sympathy for young people who were brought here at early ages.” But when the program’s host, George Stephanopoulos, asked if Mr. Trump’s remark meant that they could remain in the country, Mr. Sessions said this: “Well, we’ll see. I believe that everyone that enters the country unlawfully is subject to being deported. However, we’ve got — we don’t have the ability to round up everybody, and there are no plans to do that.” Mr. Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly went even further in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. These people were here “unlawfully,” he acknowledged, but added, “we are not targeting — my organization has not targeted these so-called dreamers, DACA.” Then, in a stunning turnabout, Mr. Kelly addressed the broader immigrant community: “If you are simply here illegally, we don’t really have the time [to] go after you. We’re looking for bad men and women.” The president made many dubious promises in his campaign, but now he’s having trouble with another wall, constructed by our Founding Fathers, and made up of three, totally independent branches of government. They were designed to deal with the very situations we face today in the Age of Trump. • Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.

How Hillary doomed her ‘inevitable presidency’
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: While we’re examining the accomplishments of Donald Trump’s first 100 days — putting his man on the U.S. Supreme Court is the biggie — Hillary Clinton is getting the once-over (and the second and third) for all the reasons why she’s not the first woman to preside over her own first 100 days in the Oval Office. She never understood that “the fault, dear Hillary, is not in the stars, but in yourself.” In “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign,” the book Washington is talking about, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, write a sweeping drama with lots of supporting actors strutting across the stage. The characters are worthy of the Bard. It’s a tale told not in the poetry of Elizabethan tragedy, but as comedy or farce. When the curtain finally falls on election night, there are no dead bodies to drag offstage, but lots of Machiavellian characters litter the landscape, muttering asides and revealing dark insights into behind-the-scenes machinations. The cast includes a husband with no “impulse-control button,” and enough jesters, fools and sycophants to destroy the myth of the irresistible Hillary juggernaut ordained to elect the first woman president of the United States. In one richly farcical case of mistaken identity, an aide misunderstands the name of the interviewer Hillary wanted for her first television interview. She said she wanted “Bianna,” meaning Bianna Golodryga of Yahoo! News, the wife of Peter Orszag, a onetime Clinton administration economic adviser, whom she considered friendly and deferential. The aide thought she meant “Brianna,” as in Brianna Keilar, and that’s who got the live interview for CNN. She asked tough questions about Hillary’s infamous email server. Hillary grew defensive, especially when she was asked, “Would you vote for someone you didn’t trust?” This was a classic softball, which someone at ease with the press might have knocked out of the park. Instead, she glared daggers at the questioner, and replied, as if in a sulk, “People should and do trust me.” The lady doth protest too much, methinks — and so did much of the national audience. Such insights, errors and sloppy staff work dogged her throughout the campaign, and this after-the-fact focus in this season of her discontent shows her to be the culprit in her demise. “Shattered” supports why a Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that Donald Trump, despite low approval ratings, would still defeat Hillary in the Electoral College, and this time in the popular vote as well, by 43 percent for the Donald and 40 percent for the Lady Macbeth late of Little Rock. A remarkable 96 percent of Trump voters say they would vote for him again, and only 15 percent of Hillary voters would still vote for her. Richard Nixon might have felt at home in the Hillary bunker. After her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Hillary aides assigned loyalty scores to members of Congress, from 1 to 7. A score of 1 reflected high loyalty, 7 likely to commit “egregious acts of treachery.” Such expectations of disloyalty terrified everyone in the bunker. Donald Trump, by contrast, inspires a different kind of loyalty. His supporters stick with him despite his evident flaws, his angry tweets, anger that can go public in an instant. They nevertheless believe he’s got their back. There’s no mushy empathy like the Clintons’ phony assurance that “we feel your pain.” The president’s fans don’t like some of the things he’s done, but still think he’ll deliver on his promise to bring about change, and destroy the establishment of the elites that has grown fat and stale, surviving long past their sell-by date. In town halls during spring break, many voters vented anger at congressmen for their support of the president. But Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, typical of the president’s loyal friends in Congress, offered a defense. “We’d be hard pressed to find a president who doesn’t have flaws,” she said. “I support a majority of the policies versus the actual person.” A Bubba defender couldn’t have said it better. Hillary has yet to measure the man or understand the “ordinary” men and women who stand with the president. When her aides, preparing her for one of the debates, had to choose someone to play the Donald, casting was a problem because the campaign didn’t want a Saturday Night Live imitation, but someone to rattle and annoy her. Anthony Weiner, the suspect sex-texter husband of Huma Abedin, was suggested. But Phillipe Reines, a senior aide with an acid tongue and a reputation for rudeness, was selected. He helped her to an unflappable debate performance, but couldn’t do anything about the school-marm style that turned off the millions. Hillary is a woman of many gifts, but not what the poet Bobby Burns described as “the gift to see ourselves as others see us.” It was the fatal flaw. • Suzanne Fields is a columnist for The Washington Times and is nationally syndicated.

Talking right
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Trump did something Monday I have long advocated. He met with a small group of conservative journalists, pundits and radio talk show hosts. I was among them. After ticking off a list of what he said were his accomplishments leading up to the arbitrary 100-day marker of his presidency, we asked him questions. What differed from the crowd of liberal journalists who ask questions during formal news conferences — and those who toss questions at his spokesman, Sean Spicer, at the daily press briefing — is that our group asked questions with the intent of getting information, instead of the accusatory tone and “gotcha” questions that often characterize what has come to be known as the mainstream media. The session was supposed to be on “background,” meaning the president could not be quoted, but halfway through he declared it on the record, which is how news broke of his decision to impose a 20 percent tariff on Canadian lumber entering the United States. Mr. Trump said it is “unfair” for the Canadian lumber industry to receive government subsidies. Reciprocity, he called it, “a word I like.” The questions were substantive, including mine about North Korea (“Given your stated budding friendship with China’s President Xi Jinping and what you say are his efforts to dissuade North Korea’s nuclear program, would you say war is less likely, or about as likely?”) The president said he doesn’t discuss military matters in public, but in his answer to my follow-up question he said he’s not sure some of the armaments recently paraded through the streets of Pyongyang are real, “but we’ll see.” Conservatives should not be lapdogs for a Republican president. No one asked the types of softball questions the media usually toss at a Democratic president. The president told us he doesn’t expect to be free of criticism, but appreciates fairness. He allowed that conservative journalists are likely to be fairer to him than those his strategist, Steve Bannon, has called “the enemy” and “opposition party.” A side note: Mr. Bannon stood off to the side at our meeting with the president, frequently smiling. Evidence that the major media tilt left is undeniable. The Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog organization, has calculated that during the first 30 days of his presidency “the president and his team were the subject of 16 hours of coverage on just the Big Three evening newscasts, or more than half (54 percent) of all of the news coverage during this period. And while most new presidents enjoy a media honeymoon, the tone of Trump’s coverage was nearly as hostile (88 percent negative) as we found during last year’s presidential campaign (91 percent negative).” The New York Times on Tuesday provided a useful service. It carried a story noting how differently conservative and liberal reporters and commentators have treated Mr. Trump and his administration. Reading these suggests not just different perspectives, but different realities. The mini news conference ended with a promise by a White House staff member that there would be more of these gatherings. They seem to be an outgrowth of Sean Spicer’s strategy to broaden media access beyond the usual collection of liberal journalists and even beyond Washington, as he does with occasional questions via Skype from reporters and anchors in other cities. Most of these have also been substantive and reflect issues and perspectives from outside the Washington Beltway. While some reporters have groused about this exercise in ideological pluralism, the public is getting more information and a different perspective than what they are used to. That can only be good for the country, for conservative journalists who are often ignored by the major media, and for the president. • Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.

Go, Trump, go — pare back the national monuments
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Donald Trump is taking aim at some of Barack Obama’s national monuments — most notably the ridiculously large Bears Ears 1.3 million acre set-aside signed into being in Utah last December — as well as at designations made by other presidents during other administrations. And this is great news. Terrific news. When it comes to the country’s national monuments, this White House’s attitude should be one of slash and burn — not conserve and preserve. Let’s be real here. Obama’s 12th-hour Bears Ears National Monument declaration was not about protecting land, saving properties from future destruction, preserving our country’s historical records or artifacts. It was about sticking it to the Constitution, that little piece of paper Obama used mostly for Kleenex. And it was about thumbing his nose at the states — mostly Republican states — that had previously maintained control of some of these public properties (which is just another way of sticking it to the Constitution, the 10th Amendment). Believe it or not — and truly, most people these days fall into the latter category of “not,” primarily because that’s where political conditioning has led — the Constitution really does address private property rights and really does provide protections for land- and business-owners. One such protection can be found in the Fifth Amendment, the section that reads: “nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” That means the government can’t simply grab private property or affix so many regulatory restrictions on the property that it becomes virtually useless — that it becomes the subject of a regulatory taking. Courts, and the Antiquities Act of 1906, have since eroded the concept of the Fifth Amendment, however. The Antiquities Act was established by Congress as a means of protecting those public properties seen as historically, culturally and scientifically significant to America — properties like the Grand Canyon, for instance. And it was established primarily as a means of stopping the widespread acts of vandalism that destroyed or degraded several of the countries’ notable properties. The logic? That the federal government, better than the states or even private sectors, could manage and oversee these lands. In other words: The Antiquities Act was never supposed to be a means of controlling the population, of scoring political points, of rewarding special rights, of catering to radical interests or of advancing progressive-socialist ideals. But that’s what it’s become. That’s what Obama’s lame-duck and Republican-opposed naming of 1.35 million acres as federally protected and managed Bears Ears land was. That’s what Bill Clinton’s 1996 Republican-opposed naming of 1.9 million acres of Grand Staircase-Escalante land as a national monument in southern Utah was. And there are scores more that could be listed — scores more by presidents from both political parties that came in the face of widespread opposition from political officials, gaming groups, hunters, recreational vehicle clubs, fishers, miners and business- and private property groups. But the main point is this: The declaration of national monuments by our nation’s presidents has gotten way out of control. And the fact that Trump’s willing to take a look at some of these properties and give them a second look to see if hey, maybe they can be scaled back a bit, or even outright removed from the federal program, is a very happy day for those who’ve watched the growth of the federal land management hand with alarm. Specifically, Trump’s issued an executive order for dozens of national monuments declared over the past 20 or so years to be reviewed. Among: Bears Ears and Grande-Escalante. Happily, the review may also include recommendations for Congress to reform the Antiquities Act and make it a bit tougher for a president, unilaterally, to restrict human use on such massive swaths of land. As Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said: “[This order will restore] the trust between local communities and Washington.” Quite right — so long as the review leads to real action. And when the environmental and conservation groups sue? Let ‘em. They’re already crying about the fact the Antiquities Act doesn’t allow for properties to be removed from federally protected status — only added. Well, here’s a thought on that: Who makes the rules? Right. The same people who created the rules that allowed the properties to be protected in the first place. Saying the rule makers can’t change the rules they made — by doing their rule-making jobs — is ridiculous. It’s just a ploy to halt the fight before it even begins. Besides, we’re not talking about turning over the federally managed lands to housing developers. We’re talking about coming up with options that reel in the heavy fed presence — options that could include turning the properties to the states to manage, dwindling the boundaries to more manageable levels, putting some land in the control of public-private sectors, etc. What’s wrong with that? So to repeat, let the leftists sue. This administration is pretty handy on the ‘ol court circuit. And this time, it looks like Republicans in Congress and at the state level are on the same policy track as Trump — the one that says with the Antiquities Act, maybe less is more.

Tangled in Obama’s Iran nuclear trap
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: On April 18, the State Department certified Iran to be in compliance with its commitments under the Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). As France’s iconic foreign minister, the Marquis de Talleyrand, once reportedly said: “This was worse than a crime; it was a mistake.” The applicable statute not only did not require such a certification, it openly invited President Trump not to make one if circumstances warranted, as they clearly did here. More seriously, the certification raises fundamental questions whether the State Department’s bureaucracy knows or cares that U.S. Iran policy has changed with the Trump administration’s advent. The applicable reporting statute requires that, at least every 90 days, the president must determine whether he “is able to certify” that among other things, “Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements,” and that “Iran has not taken any action, including covert activities, that could significantly advance its nuclear weapons program.” By the explicit terms of the reporting obligation, the president (whose authority had been delegated to the secretary of State) was required only to decide whether he could avow Iran’s full implementation of its JCPOA obligations. He was not required to make a binary choice, either certifying that Iran was complying or that Iran was not complying. He could have sidestepped, especially given his administration’s short time in office and its ongoing review of Iran policy, not to mention what we know about Iran’s violations just from publicly available information. Of course, one consequence of not certifying compliance is that the reporting statute also provides for expedited legislative consideration of new anti-Iran sanctions legislation. That may have been the bureaucracy’s motivation, but, given Mr. Trump’s clear views on the Iran deal, could hardly have affected the White House view. How could such a mistake have been made? Perhaps because of a significant challenge facing Mr. Trump, namely avoiding becoming entangled in a bureaucratic trap set by his predecessor. In critical respects, President Obama negotiated the JCPOA to be inherently unverifiable. The vaguely written and internally contradictory text of the agreement, with language invariably favorable to Iranian interpretations that would subvert its ostensible intent, is the opposite of how arms agreements should be written. This is no surprise, because a verifiable nuclear agreement was not what Mr. Obama wanted. Instead, he sought a political agreement with Tehran that would neither require Senate approval nor be easily terminated by subsequent administrations. Given that objective, a tightly written, readily verifiable agreement with which Iran never had any intention of complying would have been an obstacle rather than an aid. Equally troubling were steps taken during Obama’s administration to lessen the State Department’s capacity to determine compliance with all international arms-control agreements. In 1999, a remarkable bipartisan coalition led by Sens. Jesse Helms and Joe Biden, over the Clinton administration’s vigorous objections, created in the State Department a Bureau of Verification and Compliance (VC). The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in its report on the legislation creating VC, rejected the Clinton State Department’s proposed “demotion of verification and compliance functions” by putting them under the assistant secretary for arms control. Noting “a true commitment to vigorous enforcement of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and sanctions cannot be maintained by submerging compliance analysis within other bureaus,” and given “the inevitable tension between enforcement of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and the implications of enforcement with various countries,” the VC assistant secretary was to provide the essential independent voice on verification and compliance matters “at the most senior level of the Executive Branch.” VC was never accepted by State’s arms-control bureaucracy. When Mr. Obama took office, his appointees immediately and effectively downgraded VC. Knowing that repeal of the Helms-Biden legislation was politically impossible, the Obama administration instead merged VC into State’s arms-control bureau, creating the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. The verifiers were thereby all but silenced. In fact, the merger essentially recreated the situation that had given rise to the Helms-Biden legislation in the first place. As a result, there was no institutional check on the Obama administration’s desire to get a deal with Iran at any cost, particularly when it came to verification. As assessed in the Sept. 2, 2015 Letter of Experts to Mr. Obama, verification of the JCPOA, is “completely ineffective.” Thus, the very bureaucracy that negotiated the deal now gets to assess Iran’s compliance. In addition to the vagueness of many of the JCPOA’s terms, the agreement expresses many Iranian commitments as being voluntary, based on Iran’s “plans.” For example, “Iran will abide by its voluntary commitments, as expressed in its own long-term enrichment and enrichment R&D plan to be submitted as part of the initial declaration for the Additional Protocol to Iran’s Safeguards Agreement.” That is, after Iran’s nuclear program is declared to be peaceful in eight years. Candidate Trump called the JCPOA “the worst deal ever negotiated.” Now, the State Department personnel who helped John Kerry ensure it was a U.S. diplomatic Waterloo will be free to color the Trump administration’s review of their work. President Trump and his team should urgently address this critical deficiency, or with absolute confidence, we can predict it will return to bite them again. • John R.

The anatomy of a Trump decision
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: When Donald Trump’s Florida lawyer Paul Rampell first proposed turning the future president’s Mar-a-Lago estate into a private club, Mr. Trump pronounced the idea “dumb.” Over the next month, Messrs. Rampell and Trump argued back and forth about the idea until Mr. Trump finally agreed with Mr. Rampell. What happened in between provides an anatomy of how Mr. Trump makes decisions and gives insight into what sometimes seems like chaos in the Trump White House. Mr. Trump bought Marjorie Merriweather Post’s 114-room 1927 estate for $5 million in 1985. A white elephant, the estate cost $1 million a year to maintain. By 1991, Mr. Trump wanted to subdivide the estate’s 20 acres into lots. He consulted Mr. Rampell, who argued that the best use of the property would be a private club. Mr. Trump derided the idea, saying it sounded like a Studio 51, a nightclub that would not be attractive in Palm Beach. Mr. Rampell said that unlike a nightclub, club members could dine and celebrate weddings and other occasions. Mr. Trump could create a spa facility, add tennis courts, and provide beach services. Mr. Rampell, who is Jewish, said that unlike some of the other private clubs in Palm Beach, the club would admit Jews and blacks. Mr. Trump countered that no one would want to join the club if it did not have a golf course. Mr. Rampell said other clubs in Palm Beach without golf courses do just fine. On and on the argument went. After meeting with Mr. Rampell in person at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump called him almost every day over the next month, sometimes speaking with him several times a day. As he does in the White House, Mr. Trump consulted a range of other people. He told Mr. Rampell that friends who are in real estate told him the idea would never work. Several other lawyers also threw cold water on the idea. In determining legal strategy, Mr. Rampell says, Mr. Trump consults a number of lawyers, then makes up his mind. Often no one can guess the outcome until Mr. Trump announces his decision. In canvassing different opinions, Mr. Trump does not necessarily limit himself to experts. I remember when my wife Pamela Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter, and I flew down with Mr. Trump to stay at Mar-a-Lago as part of the research for my 1999 book “The Season: Inside Palm Beach and America’s Richest Society.” Mr. Trump drove Pam and me in his Durango SLT to a $2.5 million waterfall being built at his new Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach. Trump had to decide what color rocks to use. He liked the whiter ones, but he asked Pam and me and the workmen which color we preferred. We all liked the reddish ones, so Mr. Trump went with them. In the days leading up to his 2017 New Year’s Eve party, when I chatted with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago about problems in the Secret Service and other matters, he asked my opinion on Israeli settlements and the two-state solution. I know as much about the Middle East as Mr. Trump knows about the Talmud, but I gave my opinion. Indeed, that was the way Mr. Trump first learned about Mar-a-Lago, chatting with his limousine driver and asking about properties for sale. “Trump constantly canvasses opinions from people around him, even security guards or housekeepers,” Mr. Rampell, who has turned down over 100 requests for interviews about Mr. Trump, tells me. “It was fun to argue with him,” he says. “He would use these great New York expressions like “Fuggetaboutit” and “Are you outa your mind?” When Palm Beach Town Council members opposed turning Mar-a-Lago into a club and later tried to impose crushing restrictions on it, Mr. Trump enlisted Mr. Rampell to use the carrot and the stick. Mr. Trump believed that the prejudice of Palm Beach Town Council members, some of whom belonged to clubs that discriminate to this day, was in part behind their opposition to his plan to turn the estate into a private club that would not discriminate. Mr. Rampell sent DVDs of “Gentleman’s Agreement,” a movie about anti-Semitism in the 1940s, and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” about anti-black prejudice, to the mayor and to each of the town council members. Guided by Mr. Rampell, Mr. Trump invited members of the town council to play golf or tennis with him. He invited them to parties with beautiful young women at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Rampell helped raise money for one council member’s campaign and let her use his office for phone banks. Mar-a-Lago opened as a club in 1995. The club makes a profit of $15.6 million a year. The property, which fronts on both sides of the 3.75-square-mile island, is worth an estimated $300 million. If Mr. Trump consults a wide circle of people before making decisions, he is also loyal to them. One day, Mr. Rampell opened the door of his Palm Beach home to find an expensive computer from Mr. Trump for his son’s birthday. Mr. Rampell later learned that Mr. Trump had gone shopping for it himself and delivered it himself. “He is very open-minded and has a humanitarian side to him that people don’t see,” Mr. Rampell says. “He will pay off people’s mortgages and hospital bills. At the same time, he is willing to take risks. Other lawyers told him the town would never approve Mar-a-Lago. He went ahead against long odds.” • Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, is the author of “The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents” (Crown Forum).

Ending the threats of a government shutdown
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: We are looking at another potential federal government shutdown this week. The high drama over passing a budget, passing spending bills under regular order, and the lifting of the debt ceiling has gone on for far too many years. Congress and the White House should be able to at least complete the basics of governing smoothly or be forced to do so by risk of a personal penalty or fine. The three triggers for punishing members of Congress should be related to the three most basic parts of their job — passing a budget, funding the federal government under regular order, and managing the debt status of the United States. The personal fine on members of Congress would have to be very severe and must be immediate. Make members of Congress cut their own wrists before they pull the life support from the American people by not passing critical legislation when due. I strongly believe they will rush to find common ground at least among their own party members, ignore those who are hopelessly opposed to doing so, and pass aforementioned legislations on time. It must not wait until Election Day. The record would show that the vast majority of the members of Congress do not fear elections with many not having a serious challenger in decades and others could not be beaten by Mother Teresa, if she registered with the opposition party, due to political gerrymandering and historical trends. The American people want our Congress to do its job. And that takes 535 members and the White House working together. I was an elected official for more than a decade with most of that time as a member of Congress from the great state of Connecticut. I’m Republican — and I go way back. I can remember meeting President Reagan in the White House as an elected official. I was the first black conservative elected to Congress, and I was the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in nearly 60 years back in 1990. It is my belief that the most skilled members of Congress are the ones who are able to work with other members to help their constituents, state and nation. Voters can only reward you so much for “trying and failing” — and today, Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. There are no excuses. Achievements are what warrant praise. Giving your supporters false expectations or overpromising would slowly come to an end. Everyone understands that Rome was not built in a day. It often takes small steps to truly make a positive difference. The more steps taken, the closer you get to your goal. It took a while for Congress to get to this point. Eliminating earmarks stripped the party leadership of a large amount of its strength. The expanded use of gerrymandering in congressional districts created more polarization and has made it very difficult to beat an incumbent. Thus, there are little consequences for a person’s actions. On the rare occasions when a member of Congress is defeated, they are frequently replaced with a person more to the left or right. To achieve nothing is not an achievement. That is why the approval ratings for Congress have been so low over the years. We should fine all the members of Congress and the president if they are unable to do the basic parts of their aforementioned jobs and eliminate the anywhere, anytime threat of removal of a speaker. We would have a much smoother running federal government. (To affect Congress it would only take a rule change). How hefty should the fine be to get their attention and how should it be done to ensure fairness? After all, some members are multimillionaires and a fine too small would cause them to ignore it. On the other hand, some members are living month to month from their paycheck, and you do not want the fine to be too crippling for those folks. The solution is to make it a percentage of their adjusted gross income (AGI) from their most recent federal tax return. This would make it fair. Make the fine equal to 10, 15 or 20 percent of their AGI payable to a nonprofit like the United Way of America. The result — gridlock is over. Politicians would learn not only to work with others who have different views but they will also learn to manage the expectations of their constituents. Those who are the best and the brightest will shine in such an environment and the American people would benefit the most. • Gary Franks is a former Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Connecticut.

Will 2020 be another 1972 for Democrats?
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Forty-nine years ago, Vice President Hubert Humphrey was the Democratic candidate for president. The year 1968 was a tumultuous one that saw the assassinations of rival candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. Lyndon Johnson’s unpopular lame-duck Democratic administration imploded due to massive protests against the Vietnam War. Yet Humphrey almost defeated Republican nominee Richard Nixon, losing the election by just over 500,000 votes (43.4 percent to 42.7 percent). Infighting Democrats could have defeated the unpopular Nixon if not for a few unforeseen developments. Their convention in Chicago turned into a creepy carnival of televised rioting and radical protests. Hippies and leftists were seen battling police in the streets on prime-time news. The former Democratic governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ran as a states’ rights third-party candidate and drew 13.5 percent of the vote. Wallace destroyed the Democrats’ traditional hold on the old “solid South” by winning five Southern states outright. He also siphoned off enough traditional Democratic supporters to give Nixon astonishing Republican victories in half-a-dozen other states in the region. Nixon won over a few Northern blue-collar states that had often voted Democratic, such as Wisconsin and Ohio — again with help from Wallace, who appealed to fed-up, working-class Democrats. What was the lesson from 1968? The Democrats could have recalibrated their message to appeal more to working-class voters. They should have rebuilt the old Franklin D. Roosevelt-era coalition that had elected Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, mostly by appealing to paycheck issues and avoiding radical agendas. Yet despite picking up 12 House seats in the 1970 midterm elections, and instead of attributing the 1968 loss to Wallace’s third-party populism and voter pushback against radicalism, the Democrats went off the rails and veered hard left in 1972. The lowering of the voting age to age 18 in 1971 also tricked Democrats into wrongly thinking that most new young voters were leftists and would vote in record numbers for leftist candidates. So the Democrats in 1972 foolishly nominated die-hard left-wing South Dakota Sen. George McGovern. Although President Nixon wasn’t a popular political figure, he was busy unifying voters by moving all over the political map. The wily, flexible and pragmatic Nixon talked hard-right but actually moved to the center. He created the Environmental Protection Agency. He vastly expanded the welfare state and pushed for universal health care. Nixon also had imposed wage and price controls, and visited Communist China. Nixon ridiculed conservative icons such as California Gov. Ronald Reagan and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. as right-wing troublemakers and elitist ideologues. In other words, Nixon was as controversial — and as politically unpredictable and misunderstood — as Donald Trump. The November 1972 election proved one of the biggest Republican landslides in American history. Nixon was re-elected with more than 60 percent of the popular vote, winning 49 of 50 states. Democrats held on to Congress only because sober Democratic senators and House members up for re-election never followed the far-left trajectory of McGovern. Democrats would remain out of the White House until 1980, when Jimmy Carter ran a winning Humphrey-like campaign as a centrist populist outsider from the South. Will the 2020 end up like 1972 for Democrats? So far, the similarities are eerie. Hillary Clinton lost the election but won the popular vote over Mr. Trump. Had she campaigned more in the so-called “blue wall” states of the Rust Belt and Midwest, and not stupidly labeled a quarter of the country “irredeemable” and “deplorable,” Mrs. Clinton may have won in the Electoral College as well. As in 1968, the future lesson from the lost 2016 election was for Democrats to appeal more to working classes — and not to pander on polarizing hot-button cultural and social issues. But it appears that Democrats may be on their way to another hard-left McGovern-style blowout. Democrats are now even blaming Mrs. Clinton for being too centrist rather than for running a terrible campaign. The newly elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, is a polarizing far-left figure. The highest-profile Democratic Party supporters are increasingly smug Hollywood actors, rich Wall Street and Silicon Valley elitists, and embittered members of the media, along with careerist identity groups and assorted protest movements — a fossilized 1972 echo chamber. Democrats’ politically correct messaging derides opponents as deplorable racists, sexists, bigots, xenophobes, homophobes, Islamophobes and nativists. That shrill invective only further turns off middle America. Being merely anti-Trump is no more a successful Democratic agenda than being anti-Nixon was in 1972. Of course, anything can happen in politics. Mr. Trump may not seek re-election or could become as unpopular as Lyndon Johnson. War or economic depression could overshadow politics. The Democrats could find a charismatic candidate like Barack Obama who could win on personal popularity. Nonetheless, if in 2020 Democrats go hard left as they did in 1972, then they will likely lose just as big. • Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In the fog of breathless media coverage of the Trump White House, scant attention has been paid to the civil war breaking out on the other side of the aisle. Like most minority parties that lose the White House, the Democratic Party is without a national leader. Their legislative caucuses in the House and Senate have elected leadership, but the party itself has several elected officials fighting to lead it into the future, all with an eye toward 2020. And the party’s most visible figures aren’t exactly fresh faces. Consider: Hillary Clinton is 69, Sen. Bernard Sanders is 75, former Vice President Joe Biden is 74, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is 77, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the baby of the group, turns 68 in June. Not one of these five Democrats were born in the second half of the 20th century. Does this look like the Party of the Future? AUDIO: Matt Mackowiak with Roger Stone Now couple that aging leadership with fissures within the party that have broken out into the open just in the past two weeks. A “unity tour” featuring new DNC Chairman Tom Perez and Mr. Sanders resulted in: negative headlines, unhappy attendees booing the speakers, Mr. Sanders admitting he still won’t call himself a Democrat, and the bizarre spectacle of Mr. Perez consistently using vulgar language in public. How unifying. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the new DNC vice chair, sharply criticized former President Obama, saying, “Given we lost a lot of statehouse seats, governorships, secretary of states [under Mr. Obama], his true legacy is in danger, and I think he can’t say that he wasn’t part of those losses.” Mr. Sanders campaigned in Omaha for a mayoral candidate who several years ago supported a pro-life bill in the Nebraska legislature, sparking fierce and unrelenting criticism from the party’s pro-choice left wing. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Pelosi argue that not all Democratic candidates must support abortion rights, a position Mr. Perez rejected entirely. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 28 percent of Americans think the Democratic Party is “in touch with the concerns of most people in the U.S.” — 10 percent lower than the comparable finding for President Trump. Back in 2014, the same poll found that 48 percent believed Democrats were “in touch,” a 20-point drop in just three years. Ms. Warren, a liberal icon, stood out among Democrats in openly opposing Mr. Trump’s popular and proportionate response to the chemical attack in Syria, insisting there was “no compelling strategic justification” for the action. The result: In the aftermath of one of the most devastating and shocking national election losses in American history, Democrats remain divided on their future. Opposition to President Trump may unify them, but that is not a policy agenda, and should Democrats gain seats in the midterm elections, it will not offer them a mandate. For now, Democrats appear entirely uninterested in contributing to the public debate, content to offer no new solutions or ideas. Do they have a tax reform plan? No. How would they propose Congress “fix” Obamacare? Crickets. Do they support stronger border security? Of course not. Incredibly, Democrats appear to believe that Hillary Clinton unthinkably lost this election because she was not liberal enough. In fact, Mrs. Clinton lost because she ignored the white working class in the Midwest and ran as a status quo candidate in an election year when voters were craving change. The Clinton campaign arrogantly assumed that opposing Mr. Trump would be enough to win the White House. It was not. Democrats now appear to want to double down on that losing strategy. While Republicans are working to unleash the power of the economy, repeal and replace Obamacare, reform the tax code, rebuild the military and secure the border, Democrats appear unwilling to partner with them on any of these priorities. Not even the Democrats up for reelection in districts and states that Mr. Trump won have moved in the White House’s direction — yet. Elected Democrats are deeply frightened of their own base, fearing primary fights from more liberal challengers next year. The dynamic became evident in the debate over Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, one of the best qualified nominees in recent decades. Democrats chose to pursue the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history, rather than ask tough questions and begrudgingly support Mr. Trump’s qualified choice. Will Democrats offer nothing of any substance for the rest of 2017? Perhaps they are trying to forestall messy policy debates that divide their party. Simple math should tell them to come back to the middle ideologically. But alas, their base demands otherwise. •  Matt Mackowiak is the president of Austin-based Potomac Strategy Group, a Republican consultant, a Bush administration and Bush-Cheney re-election campaign veteran, and former press secretary to two U.S. senators.

The Democratic Party’s ‘Gong Show’
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: “[T]he Democratic Party is extremely weak and incapable of organizing people.” — Sen. Bernard Sanders, April 3, 2017. Finally, the Democrats admit it wasn’t the Russians, James B. Comey or sexism that brought Hillary Clinton down. We are now told by journalists, leading Democrats, and even a former Democratic presidential candidate, that it was the inept dysfunction of the party itself, Hillary, and her abused and frightened team that has reduced them all to irrelevant, vapid political busybodies. The poor sops. For such a long time, they told us they were beset by evil Russians, a dastardly FBI director, and that ubiquitously hideous misogyny. Such drama and international intrigue. But we now know the Democratic Party’s woes are not, at all, akin to a James Bond movie. Alas, they’re more like the “Gong Show.” The other week, Hillary Clinton made much of a book she’s working on that, she attested, pins the blame for her failure on the Russians, Mr. Comey and sexism. Sadly, someone beat her to the real story and actually reports the truth of the matter. In “Shattered,” authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes spoke with more than 100 people involved with the campaign, which they describe as “miserable even before it started.” In great detail, they describe a dysfunctional campaign, disconnected candidate, and campaign teams wracked by infighting. In a review of the book, Entertainment Weekly noted, “Although ‘Shattered’ is filled with examples of bad decisions and mishandled crises, it posits the Clinton campaign’s main failure was Hillary’s inability to explain ‘her motivation for seeking the presidency.’ “ Oh, so it was her fault? That’s going to leave a mark. Unless, of course, Mr. Allen and Ms. Parnes are actually Russian agents. Or working for Mr. Comey. Or maybe they, too, are souped-up misogynists being paid by the Koch Brothers. Or something. The blame game, however, is now so dead, even Sen. Bernard Sanders and new leftist leaders of the Democrats are admitting in public that the party is in trouble. On CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Mr. Sanders was blunt: “Well, I think what is clear to anyone who looks at where the Democratic Party today is, that the model of the Democratic Party is failing,” he told host John Dickerson. “Clearly, the Democratic Party has got to change. And, in my view, what it has got to become is a grass-roots party, a party which makes decisions from the bottom on up, a party which is more dependent on small donations than large donations, a party, John, that speaks to the pain of the working class in this country.” Fascinatingly, Mr. Sanders recognizes it’s the party itself that is the problem, but then inexplicably goes on about changing the decision-making process and how they get their money, still refusing to admit that after eight years, we didn’t want any more of what liberals were selling. The Democrats’ problem isn’t cosmetic; rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic wouldn’t have kept her from sinking. Mr. Sanders’ comments offer up a shocking revelation: The Democrats still don’t understand what happened in 2016, and they have no idea how to adapt. The issue isn’t about “bottom up” decision-making, it’s the fact that they can’t even begin to address the economic and national security issues that matter most to Americans. Mr. Sanders pandering about their party needing to “speak to the pain of the working class” of the country is also an insult. It was the Democratic Party and then-President Barack Obama that inflicted that pain on every class of Americans. And yet here is Uncle Bernie trying to pretend the Democrats have been dropped onto Earth from Mars, really, really outraged about whoever it was that set this country on fire. Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made his feelings clear about who’s responsible for the destruction of the party itself. He blames Barack Obama. At a University of Minnesota event he noted, “Barack Obama could have been a better party leader. … Given that we lost a lot of statehouse seats, governorships, secretaries of state, his true legacy is in danger. I think he can’t say that he wasn’t part of those losses. … He’s really good at getting himself elected. … Your legacy is not a building that he’s going to construct in Chicago housing his presidential papers.” Ouch. Finally, someone in the party is admitting the obvious, even if it was cautiously stated: Mr. Obama destroyed the party while creating his own cult of personality. This is so obvious, Josh Earnest, Mr. Obama’s former press secretary and now a contributor at MSNBC, said this: “What Deputy Chairman Ellison just said is true. Barack Obama didn’t run to be a party leader, he ran to be president of the United States.” But then Mr. Earnest admitted this disaster was on Mr. Obama’s mind because, “There are consequences for this deterioration of Democratic strength all across the country for the president’s legacy.” This was a perfect summation of the inept malevolence of Mr. Obama, the man. His enablers and sycophants admit that only Mr. Obama matters, and in their scramble to “fundamentally transform America,” he may have damaged the United States, but in true malignant, narcissistic fashion, his lasting legacy is the destruction of the Democratic Party. With nary a Russian in sight. • Tammy Bruce, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk show host. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Congress has been stalling border wall funding
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: A full decade after voting to construct a secure barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico, Congress continues to refuse to lay out the money required to build the damned wall. This, even after the stunning upset in last year’s elections by the juggernaut presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, who won the presidency on a clarion vow to voters that he would once and for all build a wall along the border. Mr. Trump’s historic upset came after years and years of both Democrat and Republican politicians talking tough about illegal immigration and promising to crack down on the porous border, yet refusing to actually fix the problem. Because they are politicians. If you fix the problem, then you can no longer campaign on the problem. This wall, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign, would finally halt not only illegal immigration, but also the highly destructive drugs, gangs and slavery pouring over the southern border. Despite the clear message from voters last year, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismisses the wall as “immoral, expensive and unwise.” Her comment made history as the moment Nancy Pelosi finally discovered morality. Also noteworthy is that it was the first time Nancy Pelosi has every found anything to be too “expensive” to stick to the poor, innocent American taxpayer. As for her mention of wisdom? Well, clearly, that was some kind of typo or another one of her random brain sizzles. It wasn’t so long ago that Ms. Pelosi’s fellow Democrats were all for the immoral and expensive. Her party’s last two standard-bearers — former President Barack Obama and twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — both voted in favor of the so-called “Secure Fence Act of 2006.” After passing the construction of that barrier into law, Congress balked at actually paying for it and ultimately scrapped much of it in favor of — well, whatever the White House felt like doing. Under former President Bush and then President Obama, that wasn’t much. Since then, problems at the border have only grown worse. Today, there are untold millions of illegal aliens in the United States, including many who are criminals. “Bad hombres,” Mr. Trump calls them. Increasingly, we hear reports of staggering violence committed by the international gang MS-13, made up primarily of illegal aliens from Central America. These vicious thugs peddle the drugs across the border and import slavery in the form of human trafficking. The violence they are capable of is beyond the imagination of civilized people. To be sure, these gangs got much stronger under Mr. Obama. Throughout his entire presidency, the U.S. border had a giant blinking neon “WELCOME” sign, encouraging men, women, children and criminals to storm across the border. This beefed up the ranks of MS-13 and led to who knows how many crimes against Americans. Everyone remembers Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old killed two years ago while walking along a pier with her family in San Francisco. Charged with her murder was an illegal from Mexico who had been deported five times. It is a fair question: How many Kate Steinles are there? The answer is maddening: We have no idea. That is because the federal government, which keeps records of how many toilets every citizen has in their homes, does not keep track of how many Americans are killed by illegal aliens who are supposed to be kept out of the country by said federal government. Such information is scattered, and federal bureaucrats are shockingly incurious about compiling that information. Any information they do have is not shared with the public. “During the Obama administration, it seemed to be very intentional. The numbers were hidden,” explained Timothy Lyng, president of The Remembrance Project, a group dedicated to giving voice to the victims killed by illegals. But there is hope. President Trump says he remains committed to building the wall. Already, he has done more than the last five presidents and 40 years of Congresses to fix the problem. Just since taking office, border crossings have plummeted by an unthinkable 70 percent or more. Mr. Trump has earned the credibility to get the money he wants for the wall from a Congress that has proved itself utterly incompetent when it comes to fixing the border. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

Portland parade canceled after protesters threaten to rough up Republicans
.B
Protesters in Portland, Oregon, have gone from blocking streets  and disrupting City Council meetings to threatening to rough up  Republicans, and James Buchal is sick of it. The chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, Mr.  Buchal accused city officials of kowtowing to “domestic terrorism” after  an annual parade was canceled over a warning from radicals who said  they would wreck the event unless Republicans were excluded. “[O]nce again, local civic leaders didn’t do enough to prevent  organized gangs of criminal thugs from running rampant in the city,” Mr.  Buchal said Wednesday in a statement. “According to the criminal  elements, they control the streets of Portland.” SEE ALSO: Ann Coulter drops plans to visit Berkeley: Report Organizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade scrapped the  Saturday event after receiving an anonymous email offering a choice:  Either bar the Multnomah County Republicans or “we will have two hundred  or more people rush into the parade into the middle and drag and push  those people out.” “You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the  police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your  decision wisely,” said the email from thegiver@riseup.net. There was little doubt that the protesters could make good on  their threat. Left-coast cities like Portland and Berkeley, California,  have borne the brunt of the resistance’s wrath since President Trump was  elected, despite their status as havens of liberalism. Conservative author Ann Coulter on Wednesday canceled her  speech at the University of California, Berkeley after Young America’s  Foundation withdrew its support amid threats of violence. “It’s sickening when a radical thuggish institution like  Berkeley can so easily snuff out the cherished American right to free  speech,” Ms. Coulter tweeted. Like Berkeley, leftist Portland has been rocked since November  by a relentless stream of left-wing demonstrations against the  president, in some cases resulting in vandalism and arrests. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, cracked down on  protesters in March after they repeatedly shut down city council  meetings by interrupting council members and staff. Commissioner Nick Fish advised his staff to stop attending  meetings over safety concerns. Mr. Wheeler spent two nights in a hotel  after activists blocked access to his Portland Heights home. There’s evidence that other Portlanders grow weary of the  mayhem. A video posted Jan. 26 by Fox12 Oregon showed onlookers cheering  as police broke up masked protesters blocking a busy city street. After the Tax Day protest on April 15, Oregon Republican Party  spokesman Kevin Hoar blasted the “pointless perpetual protests by  anti-Trump fringe groups.” “It must be frustrating for so many Oregonians who want to  enjoy a beautiful, sunny Easter weekend in Portland to have perpetual,  professional, astroturf protesters disrupting their day with POLITICS,  especially over an issue that only fringe activists care about,” Mr.  Hoar said in a statement. The 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association cited “threats of  violence” for its decision, saying that it could “no longer guarantee  the safety of our community and have made the difficult decision to  cancel the parade.” The Direct Action Alliance, which had organized an event on  Facebook called “Defend Portland from Fascists at the Avenue of Roses  Parade,” said it was “disappointed” by the cancellation, but vowed that  “we will always defend our community.” The alliance said that “known members of neo-Nazi and anti immigrant hate groups planned to attend the event.” “[W]e intended to stand between them and those who they wanted  to intimidate. We intended to block out their hate and shut down their  violence,” said the alliance. It was unclear what was meant by “hate groups.” Members of  Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump group that opposes the “antifa” movement,  had scheduled a March for Free Speech on the same day in Portland. Mr. Buchal said the local Republican Party had participated in  the 11th annual parade in East Portland for years and had expected  hundreds of its members to attend. “The bottom line is that Portland needs to choose between  supporting terrorist thugs and protecting average citizens who want to  participate in their community,” he said. “The Multnomah County  Republican Party is not composed of ‘Nazis’ and ‘white supremacists,’  and those who think we would tolerate marching in a parade with folks  carrying swastikas are delusional.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Yale may ditch ‘freshman’ for gender-inclusive ‘first-year’: ‘It’s an antiquated term’
.B
Yale’s top officials say “it’s time” to leave the term “freshman” behind in favor of something considered gender inclusive. Administrators at one of the world’s most prestigious universities may adopt the term “first-year” as a way to be more welcoming to new students. Yale’s Dean of Student Affairs Camille Lizarríbar is leading the charge to make it happen “before the next academic year.” “I think there comes a time when you want to make sure that the way  you’re calling things reflects the values that you have,” Ms. Lizarríbar  told Yale News on March 8. “If we really are serious about inclusivity  and diversity, we need to look at everything. It’s not written in stone  that it has to be ‘freshman.’ … We do have some agency in what we call  things.” Yale College Dean Jonathan Holloway added that he spent “a lot of time thinking about, recognizing yes, it’s an antiquated term.” “Dean Lizarríbar, who oversees freshman or first-year  orientation … basically said ‘it’s time,’ and I have no problem with  that,” he added. Students at the Ivy League university, which was founded in 1701, backed the change. “The administration should be doing everything it  can do to  make sure that every student feels included in regular  identifiers that  people use [among] the undergraduate student body,” Isaac Amend said. Student Aadit Vyas deemed the change a “fair move.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

CNN anchor Jake Tapper has sold the Northwest Washington, D.C., home he and his wife have owned for almost a decade, Variety reported Thursday. The property went for $1.4 million. The magazine describes the residence as a nearly 3,000-square-foot, 5-bedroom home in the capital’s Forest Hills neighborhood, just “about five miles due north of the White House.” Mr. Tapper and wife Jennifer purchased the home in June 2007 for $1.25 million and it was hailed as a “stylish Washington retreat” in a March/April 2008 profile for Home & Design magazine. “I had a deep emotional connection to it on one level because it reminds me a lot of my grandparents’ house,” Mr. Tapper said at the time.

Conservative groups trying to derail two potential Supreme Court picks
.B
As President Trump nears a decision this week on his Supreme Court nominee, conservative groups are actively trying to derail at least two of the judges reported to be at the top of his list, saying they can’t be relied on to pursue conservative goals from the federal bench. One group is running ads accusing 11th U.S. Circuit Court Judge William Pryor of showing hostility toward religious liberty in a 2011 case, and another is warning Mr. Trump not to pick 10th U.S. Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, saying he has not shown enough devotion to pro-life causes. Mr. Trump met with top senators Tuesday to begin the consultation process. He said he wants to make his decision this week and announce the nominee next week. SEE ALSO: Donald Trump to name Supreme Court pick next Thursday The next justice will tip the ideological balance on the now-deadlocked Supreme Court and replace Antonin Scalia, a conservative stalwart whose seat has been empty since his death nearly a year ago. Public Advocate, run by conservative activist Eugene Delgaudio, has launched online ads in the Washington area trying to raise opposition to Judge Pryor, a former Alabama attorney general, saying he didn’t do enough to protect Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in a 2003 legal battle over posting the Ten Commandments at his courthouse. “Public Advocate has budgeted a lot of money refuting some of the legal issues [Judge] Pryor takes so lightly, and as I point out frequently: No other judge has removed an elected official, like Roy Moore, for believing in God and the Ten Commandments in the history of our country,” Mr. Delgaudio said. SEE ALSO: Tom Perez: Democrats should filibuster ‘hard right’ Supreme Court nominee His ads also highlight a case in which Judge Pryor was involved in which the appeals court ruled that a college did not discriminate against a student who was expelled for refusing to attend a gay pride parade. Going to the parade was part of “remediation” measures for the Christian student, who was studying counseling. Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious liberties law firm, represented the Christian student but declined to comment to The Washington Times about Judge Pryor’s possible selection. The Judicial Action Group said Judge Pryor’s judicial record demonstrates that he “failed to interpret the Constitution as the framers intended.” Some pro-life activists, meanwhile, say Judge Gorsuch would not meet Mr. Trump’s pledge to put pro-life judges on the federal bench. Andrew Schlafly, a lawyer at the Legal Center for Defense of Life and son of the late conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, said Judge Gorsuch uses pro-choice terminology in his writings and may not be willing to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national constitutional right to abortion. “Gorsuch is not pro-life,” Mr. Schlafly said. “That would break Trump’s pro-life pledge to pick Gorsuch.” Defending the choices Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said the attacks on both judges were misplaced. “Pryor does have a very, very solid record on having a principled approach to the Constitution,” Ms. Severino said. “He’s a stellar lawyer, so I think he would be an excellent choice.” As for Judge Gorsuch, she said, those attacking his record are looking for the wrong characteristics in a justice. “It’s important for the serious pro-life groups to make clear that they’re not looking at people who are supposed to be basically activists, bypassing the law on any issue,” she said. Judge Gorsuch, through the clerk of court for the 10th Circuit, declined to comment. Judge Pryor did not respond to a request for comment. American Family Association public policy analyst Abraham Hamilton III said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans dare not “err in filling this vacancy,” saying the pick must live up to the legacy of Justice Scalia, one of the most forceful conservative voices on the court for decades. He said Judge Pryor had a distinguished record but was not sure he lives up to Justice Scalia’s vision “as an originalist constructionist” in some areas of constitutional law, including religious liberty. “The country would be served best by filling Justice Scalia’s vacant seat with a Scalia-like nominee,” Mr. Hamilton said. Mr. Schlafly said he was worried about who had Mr. Trump’s ear in the selection process. He pointed in particular to the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian law professors, students and scholars. “The problem is really Trump’s advisers, to be honest with you,” Mr. Schlafly said. Mr. Trump said the Federalist Society, The Heritage Foundation and other conservative activists helped him shape his initial list of potential nominees, which he released in an unconventional move in the middle of the presidential campaign. The list won widespread praise from conservatives and helped him consolidate support among the Republican base after a contentious primary. Democrats have signaled that they will fight whomever Mr. Trump picks if they deem the nominee out of the mainstream. Many Democrats remain angry that the Republican Senate majority blocked any vote before the election on President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the Scalia seat. “Clearly, what they did with Garland was wrong, but we’re not playing tit-for-tat here. We want a mainstream nominee because we want what’s right for America,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer countered in his Tuesday briefing, “I think it’s pretty mainstream to support the Constitution, pretty mainstream to respect, to follow the law and not to create laws from the bench.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, rejected Democratic complaints about how the Garland nomination was handled. He said there was a difference between stopping a nominee from a lame-duck president in the months ahead of a presidential election and stopping a pick at the start of a president’s tenure. He also said that when Republicans were in the minority in the Senate, they didn’t mount filibusters to block nominees in the first years of either President Clinton or Mr. Obama’s administrations. “What we hope would be that our Democratic friends would treat President Trump’s nominees in the same way we treated Clinton and Obama,” Mr. McConnell said. • Dave Boyer and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

Nationals Park LED billboards concern Southwest waterfront residents
.B
Some residents of the Southwest waterfront fear the neighborhood could be pestered by flashing billboards after the D.C. Council on Tuesday passed a measure that allows the Washington Nationals to install massive LED ads on the baseball stadium’s exterior walls. Questions remain about how the signs will affect the waterfront district, even though the legislation underwent several revisions to restrict the number, size and location of the billboards. “It’s still a bad bill because it permits five gigantic, electronic, light-polluting, ad-spewing machines on the side of the Nats stadium,” said Meg Maguire, a member of The Committee of 100 on the Federal City — a nonprofit organization founded nearly a century ago to monitor development in the District. “The restrictions don’t take away the problem.” The Committee of 100 on the Federal City is joined by Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Andy Litsky in opposing the lighted signs — opposition that goes beyond where and how the signs will be placed, Ms. Maguire said in an interview. “This comes at a time when we know that light pollution has an effect on human health,” she said. “We know that LED bulbs can be injurious to sleep, and now we’re putting up these massive machines. They’re going to pollute our beautiful, emerging, mixed-use communities.” The measure allows the Nationals to erect five LED screens no larger than 38 feet by 25 feet outside the 8-year-old stadium. The team says billboards will generate up to $5 million a year in ad revenue — a tidy sum for a young club looking to make another playoff run and possibly pick up more talent along the way. The team hopes to have the billboards in place for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game, which the Nationals are scheduled to host. Council member Charles Allen, who represents the Ward 6 neighborhood where Nationals Park is located, said lawmakers made some concessions in revising the legislation to address criticism about the lighted signs since the first public hearing on the measure in November. Originally, the bill called for 10 signs and had few restrictions on their placement. The revised bill, which the council passed 12-1 Tuesday, cuts the number of billboards in half and prohibits them from directly facing South Capitol Street or residential buildings. Mr. Allen acknowledged that the legislation wouldn’t make everyone happy, but said there are enough provisions to quell any fears that the signs will start popping up all over the city. He said those kinds of sings aren’t appropriate everywhere, but LED billboards make sense in a lively entertainment district with a baseball stadium. But that wasn’t enough to persuade council member Elissa Silverman, the lone dissenting vote on the council. “This thing was fast-tracked in a month,” the at-large independent told The Washington Times on Wednesday. “Perhaps there’s a time and place for them, but what’s the rush to judgment here?” Ms. Silverman said she wants to know more about the signs’ impact on property values, how they could affect drivers and how they could change the character of the neighborhood. Ms. Maguire pointed to Chinatown as an example of LED billboards degrading residents’ quality of life. The Verizon Center in 2012 was approved for an exemption of the city’s 1931 moratorium on issuing permits for large signs. “Do you want that in your face night and day?” she said. “The excuse is that it will somehow enliven the public space, but that’s a problem best solved by urban designers, people who operate at a human scale. You don’t just call up a billboard company.” And Ms. Silverman is still concerned about giant signs popping up across the District, despite provisions in the bill excepting the stadium from the mostly citywide ban on lighted billboards. “There’s a legitimate fear that if you create a carve out for the Nats, it’s a Pandora’s box,” she said. “It’s not like that’s unfounded.” Ms. Silverman said property owners near the stadium already have started lobbying for their own digital billboards. With the bill likely to get final approval later this month, Ms. Maguire said she’s more focused on trying to fix what’s wrong with it. She held fast that The Committee of 100 would work in coming weeks to revise the bill before its second vote on Dec. 20. “We understand that at this point, the votes to overturn aren’t there. We don’t like that, but there are other bad things in the bill that need to be corrected. We’re going to continue to tell people what this bill does,” she said. “We want this bad bill to be as good as it can when it comes out.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Corey Lewandowski: Loretta Lynch should ‘absolutely’ recuse herself in Clinton email case
.B
Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, said on Friday that Attorney General Loretta Lynch should “absolutely” recuse herself from overseeing the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “What I suggest is she should absolutely recuse herself,” Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN’s “New Day.” Republicans have stepped up their calls for Ms. Lynch to recuse herself in light of a private meeting the attorney general held earlier in the week with former President Clinton at an airport in Arizona. Ms. Lynch said the meeting touched mainly on personal matters and that the investigation did not come up. But The New York Times, citing a Justice Department official, reported Friday that Ms. Lynch plans to announce that she will accept whatever recommendation career prosecutors and the FBI make about whether to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. “The optics are terrible. It should have never been done. She should have never been on that airplane,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “This is a disaster, and this is the problem with Washington, D.C.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Obama lifts ban on selling U.S. arms to Hanoi in a bitter irony for Vietnam veterans
.B
U.S. President Obama on this week lifted a half-century ban on selling arms to Vietnam, a move that is raising concerns among some Vietnam War veterans. “At this stage, both sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect,” said Mr. Obama in Hanoi during his first visit to the country. “This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.” He said every U.S. arms sale would be reviewed case by case to take into account Vietnam’s human-rights record. At a joint press conference with Mr. Obama, Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang said the two countries are “former enemies turned friends.” “And now we are comprehensive partners,” he said. More than 58,200 U.S. soldiers were killed in Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in 1975. But the administration saw advantages in easing the embargo, both as a warning to expansionist China and as leverage to compel the communist regime in Hanoi to improve its record on human rights. “We are thinking through how our evolving security cooperation [is] going to look moving forward,” said White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes prior to the visit. “They regularly raise this issue with us. We are looking at, of course, how our broader relationship is evolving, including our continued commitment to support human rights in Vietnam.” The notion of selling more lethal weaponry to Vietnam is a bitter irony to some veterans of the war and to some Vietnamese-Americans who fled the communists. “They are still a communist country,” said retired Army Maj. Wulf Linden, a Georgia resident who served two tours in Vietnam. “If it’s the cream of our crop [of weapons systems], obviously that would be a bad mistake. It would be nice if we’re not selling to a regime that’s a documented communist regime. That’s my concern.” Army veteran Ralph Riccio, a Pennsylvania resident who served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969, said he has mixed feelings about the potential arms sales. “As somebody who got shot at in Vietnam, I find it a little bit ironic that we’re selling them weapons now,” Mr. Riccio said. “I find it a little bit uncomfortable to come to grips with.” But he noted other examples of the U.S. embracing former wartime adversaries, such as Germany and Japan after World War II. “I understand that one day somebody’s an enemy and the next day they’re not that much of an enemy,” he said. Joe Frank, a former national commander of the American Legion and an Army veteran who lost the use of his legs to a land mine in Vietnam, said he never dreamed in the late 1960s that the U.S. would one day seek a closer alliance with Hanoi. But he said he accepts the politics of the move. “I lost a lot of friends in Vietnam. They’re on that black granite wall [the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington],” Mr. Frank said. “A soldier like me, just like the Vietnamese, we were just taking our orders from those up above. This [arms sales] is politics. It doesn’t bother me as long as long as this is well-researched.” Beefing up Vietnam’s defenses is a crucial step for the Obama administration in standing up to China’s military influence, said James Zumwalt, a retired Marine infantry officer who served in Vietnam and has written extensively about Southeast Asia. “I am not an Obama fan,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “But this is one of the few things they’ve done in the foreign policy area that I totally agree with.” He said the administration must do more to confront China over its territorial claims in the South China Sea, a region of major shipping lanes and energy deposits where Beijing has been building artificial islands. “China will try to do anything and everything they can in the remaining 200-some days that Obama’s in office to establish themselves in the South China Sea,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “That’s why I think it is absolutely imperative that Obama show some backbone and take this step and do it in a way that leaves no doubt in the minds of the Chinese that we’re upset with what they’ve done. We’ve let China get away with so much, this is kind of an inexpensive way of conveying a message to China.” Mr. Obama said his decision to lift the ban on arms sales “was not based on China,” although he added that he wants to help Vietnam “improve their maritime security posture.” “My decision to lift the ban really was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship,” the president said Monday. “Given all the work we do together across the spectrum of economic, trade, security and humanitarian efforts, that it was appropriate for us not to have a blanket across-the-board ban.” Vietnam has purchased much of its military equipment, including submarines, from Russia and is seeking costly high-tech weaponry from the U.S. The U.S., however, wouldn’t feel the effects of an arms sales agreement overnight, said Richard Fontaine, a defense analyst at the Center for New American Security who served as an adviser to Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican. Mr. Fontaine said the anti-Vietnam sentiment in Congress has faded. “It’s no longer the political obstacle that it was even 10 or 15 years ago,” he said. “The general sentiment on Capitol Hill has been, as long as Vietnam is moving in the right direction — even rather gradually toward opening up the political space and the religious freedom space and the rule of law — then we want to have an increasingly close relationship. At the same time, [on] the defense side of things, I don’t think that you will see and you shouldn’t see the United States sell truncheons and tear gas and the kinds of things that could be used for domestic repression.” Many Vietnamese-Americans say the repressive communist government doesn’t deserve the benefits of closer military and economic ties with the U.S. Bao Nguyen, the mayor of Garden Grove, California, has written a letter to Mr. Obama and to Secretary of State John F. Kerry about Vietnam’s “atrocious” human rights record, including its imprisonment of dissidents in solitary confinement without charges. “While we have an arms surplus to deal with, I don’t think dumping those arms on developing nations is the most effective way to counter China,” Mr. Nguyen said. “That’s because there’s no way to know that the government won’t use those weapons against its own people. Especially a government as corrupt and autocratic as Vietnam.” Mr. Zumwalt said the U.S. sometimes needs to work with unsavory partners, as it did with autocratic Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos during the Vietnam War. “Would I like to see a democratic government in Vietnam? I sure would,” Mr. Zumwalt said. “But I see Vietnam as being the lesser of two evils. We’ve got to show some backbone. We’ve got to show it with the Vietnamese, and we’ve got to convey the point to China that enough’s enough.” Mr. Obama’s 47th foreign trip will include three days in Vietnam and a Group of Seven summit in Japan, where he will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima. He will promote the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which includes the U.S., Vietnam and Japan. The deal is stalled in Congress and faces strong opposition from the leading presidential candidates and most Democrats, who say it doesn’t protect U.S. workers from unfair trade practices. On the issue of human rights in Vietnam, five Republican senators sent a letter Friday to Mr. Obama calling Hanoi “one of the most repressive regimes in the world” and urging Mr. Obama to press Vietnamese leaders to do more to improve religious freedom and other human rights. The letter was authored by Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, John Boozman of Arkansas, John Cornyn of Texas, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Human rights groups are urging Mr. Obama to call on Vietnamese leaders, who held a rubber-stamp election of their one-party rule last weekend, to release political prisoners and other activists. “Obama should stand next to Vietnam’s leaders in public and call on them to respect the right to freely choose government representatives, stand for office and peacefully advocate for democracy,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “If this trip is partially about legacy-building, as some suggest, there can be no more meaningful legacy than helping the people of Vietnam achieve fundamental reforms.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Nugent: Obama’s fault no guns allowed at Trump NRA speech
.B
LOUISVILLE | Rock legend Ted Nugent on Sunday said a failed criminal justice system under the leadership of President Obama is why NRA conventiongoers weren’t allowed to bring their guns with them into a Friday forum featuring likely GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mr. Nugent opened up the floor for questions during his Sunday event, and a man asked him about the Secret Service’s preventing people from bringing their guns into the Trump speech — a speech in which Mr. Trump pledged to get rid of gun-free zones. “It’s a dichotomy if ever there was one,” Mr. Nugent said. He recalled his own run-in with the Secret Service and described it as a positive experience. That was an apparent reference to a meeting prompted by comments he made at an NRA event in April 2012 that if Mr. Obama was re-elected, Mr. Nugent would either be dead or in jail by the same time the following year. “In fact, I admired and saluted ‘em face to face when they came to investigate me,” he said. “They are our friends,” he said. “The majority of law enforcement, including the feds, the majority are on our side. “The reason that policy has to exist is because of our failed court system,” he said. “Rapists, murderers, child molesters, ‘knockout’ game monsters walk the streets with us,” he said. “But instead of just keeping devils in cages, our failed anti-justice system has freed them into our communities, and now [with] Barack Obama, now there’s tens of thousands of more. “And so that’s why law enforcement has to err on the side of caution, knowing that our judges and our prosecutors and our states’ attorneys and mostly the U.S. attorneys — they have freed monsters among us,” he said. “That’s who the Secret Service is protecting Donald Trump and the other candidates from,” he said. “They’re not protecting ‘em from NRA members. “If we would keep rapists and murderers and ‘knockout’ gamers and carjackers in cages forever, no one would have to protect anybody from anybody,” he said to cheers and applause. “Everybody knows — everybody knows — that sex crimes, [molesting] is a 100 percent recidivistic crime. Everybody knows that, and our system lets them out,” he said. “Shoot them and kill them. Since they won’t control them, we shall. “’Nugent was recommending vigilanteism,’” he then said mockingly. “Whatever.” A woman also asked Mr. Nugent if he would make some phone calls because she has tickets to his July 1 show in Arizona and was afraid they wouldn’t allow guns there. “You got to me kidding me,” he replied. “We usually frisk people. If they’re unarmed, we loan ‘em one. “I will make those calls. I can’t promise anything. I’m not going to not perform, because I’ll have my gun,” he said. “That is upsetting,” he said. “So there’s going to be moments in life that don’t make any sense, and I can’t just move into Arizona and move into every state” and decree a new law, he said. “I got a lot of power, but I ain’t got that much,” he said. “So I will work on that and I will talk to the authorities.” “And I would have no problem,” he said. “In fact, I happen to know that most of you are armed right here, and I’ve never felt safer in my life.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Ann Coulter drops plans to visit Berkeley: Report
.B
Conservative columnist Ann Coulter won’t be going to UC Berkeley Thursday after all. In an email to the Reuters newswire Wednesday, the conservative firebrand said she was canceling her planned trip because “I looked over my shoulder and my allies had joined the other team.” Ms. Coulter made the promise to appear on campus last week in an April 19 tweet, promising “I WILL BE SPEAKING NEXT THURSDAY.” On Monday, Reuters reported that both the Young America’s Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans were taking the school to court for having canceled Ms. Coulter’s planned speech. Campus officials had offered to reschedule the talk to May 2, a request that was turned down by Ms. Coulter, who is on the record complaining that she met the institution’s various demands before scheduling the originally planned speech, only to essentially call their bluff when they canceled the event. Ms. Coulter’s complaint about a lack of support appears to be directed at the Young America’s Foundation (YAF). In an April 25 statement posted to its website, YAF lamented that “Berkeley made it impossible to hold a lecture due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators.” As such, the group said, while it was “pressing forward with its lawsuit” it could not “jeopardize the safety of its staff or students” by joining Ms. Coulter in her planned appearance. Ms. Coultertold The Hollywood Reporter Wednesday that YAF was “basically allying with the administration to keep me off Berkeley” and that it would be “nuts” to show up with “no one on the ground … no lawyer, no insurance, no security” backing her up. Ms. Coulter suggested YAF was too timid in its legal response and that it should have filed a motion in court to effectively order the state’s liberal Democratic governor to call in the National Guard to secure the campus. “Why hasn’t Gov. Jerry Brown ordered the national guard in?” Ms. Coulter said, THR reported. “He might have — if there had been a court order. The way we vindicate constitutional right in this country is by going to court and forcing state actors violating our rights as American citizens to stop. But YAF wouldn’t file for a court order, just damages — which Berkeley doesn’t care about. It’s on the California taxpayers.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Donald Trump to name Supreme Court pick next Thursday
.B
President Trump will announce on Thursday of next week who he wants to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, which has remained vacant for nearly a year. There are three judges reportedly in the running as Mr. Trump’s top picks for the high court. Those include: 11th U.S. Circuit Court Judge William Pryor, Judge Neil Gorsuch of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman. “I will be making my Supreme Court pick on Thursday of next week. Thank you!” Mr. Trumptweeted early Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump consulted with senators on Tuesday about his pick for the federal bench. The court has remained deadlocked since Scalia passed away last February. Republicans hope Mr. Trump will fill the seat with a staunch conservative who will defend the Constitution and follow the founders’ constitutional intent. “With Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing, Republicans cannot err in filling this vacancy,”  American Family Association public policy analyst Abraham Hamilton III told The Washington Times. “In many respects, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick(s) will define his presidential legacy, especially considering that his SCOTUS appointees’ tenure will far exceed his own.” Democrats have suggested they will protest Mr. Trump’s pick if they deem that person to be unfit. “We want a mainstream nominee because we want what’s right for America,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, stated. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Tom Perez: Democrats should filibuster ‘hard right’ Supreme Court nominee
.B
Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Wednesday that Democrats should filibuster President Trump’s next U.S. Supreme Court nominee if the candidate supports the “hard right.” “If they support the hard right, absolutely,” Mr. Perez said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “If they’re going to continue to go to the hard right, I think you have to do that.” Mr. Trump indicated Wednesday he’d be making his decision on his choice to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia next Thursday. Mr. Perez, the labor secretary under former President Barack Obama, is also running to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He said he’s a fan of data analytics, but that they’re no substitute for “good, old-fashioned organizing.” “I think Howard Dean was right: We need a 50-state strategy, along with the territories, and when you do that, when you work with states to make sure we’re fielding candidates from school board to the Senate, that’s how you rebuild the Democratic party,” he said.

Ann Coulter vows to speak at Berkeley despite cancellation
.B
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Ann Coulter fired off an angry stream of tweets Wednesday vowing to speak as planned next week at the University of California, Berkeley after campus officials called off the event for security concerns. “I WILL BE SPEAKING NEXT THURSDAY,” the right-wing commentator tweeted, calling the move to cancel her planned event on April 27 a ban on free speech. Coulter was invited to speak at Berkeley by campus Republicans on the subject of illegal immigration. The event raised concerns of more violence at Berkeley, where masked rioters smashed windows, set fires and shut down an appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos in February. University officials sent the Berkeley College Republicans a letter Tuesday, saying that officials and campus police had determined they could not ensure the safety of Coulter, audience members or protesters expected at the event. “We have been unable to find a safe and suitable venue,” said the letter from Vice Chancellor Scott Biddy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton. “Given current active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully.” The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter Wednesday. The cancellation comes days after violent clashes between far-right and far-left protesters Saturday at a rally supporting President Donald Trump in downtown Berkeley. University spokesman Dan Mogulof said that campus police learned that some of the groups that appeared to be responsible for the violence last weekend and at the Yiannopoulos event “planned to target the appearance of Ann Coulter on campus.” Last week, posters went up on campus threatening disruption of the event and officials also found chatter on various websites indicating the possibility of planned violence, Mogulof said. In its letter, the university said the students and officials could work together to reschedule the event for a later date. It noted that “most Mondays and Tuesdays in September during the day should work.” Coulter posted eight tweets in a span of 17 minutes after the AP and others reported the cancellation Wednesday. She called claims of the university trying to set up an alternate date “FAKE NEWS!” The event was being co-organized by a campus group called BridgeCal and the Young America’s Foundation, a conservative group that books Coulter’s campus speeches. “We have no intention of acceding to these unconstitutional acts,” the Young America’s Foundation said in a statement. “The Ann Coulter lecture… will go forward.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Washington would love to make franchise history at Boston’s expense
.B
BOSTON  — It seems fitting. Boston and Washington have deemed each other  irritants for two seasons now, a mutual frustration that almost tipped  into something uglier earlier in the regular season after a game in  Boston. Wizards star John Wall had words and a chest bump with Boston  strongman Jae Crowder then. Crowder stuck his finger in Wall’s face.  Security was assembled in the back halls of TD Garden after the on-court  flash of grumpiness. In  today’s cordial NBA, when players workout together in the offseason  instead of being chased by fear of what their rival is doing on another  coast, the Celtics and Wizards have what can casually be called “bad  blood” between them. Washington dress in all-black for a so-called  “funeral” game less than two weeks after the Wall-Crowder encounter.  When their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals begin Sunday  afternoon in Boston, everyone will be challenged to manage their shared  disdain during an attempt to play basketball. For  all of the Wizards’ travails, this is their third trip to the  conference semifinals in the last four seasons. The prior two they were  emphatic underdogs who had pulled a first-round upset to advance and be  an assumed patsy for the top seed in the conference. Instead, both of  those series — first with Indiana, then two years ago with Atlanta —  became tussles Washington left thinking it should have won. In  particular, the 2015 series against the Hawks when Wall received five  non-displaced fractures in his left hand has been chewed on since. Paul  Pierce was on that team. When visiting the District this season with the  Los Angeles Clippers, Pierce sat at his locker and shook his head.  “Man, we should have beat Atlanta.” Not  doing so allowed the Wizards to keep up their end in D.C. sports’  postseason failings. No team has been to a conference finals in the four  major pro sports since the Capitals made it in 1998. Wizards guard  Bradley Beal was stunned to hear the news just before the playoffs  began. He concluded that the teams owe the city. Its members surely  agree. He  and Wall are the reasons Washington stands four wins from kicking aside  that lore. They played efficient and active basketball Friday night in  Atlanta on the way to a combined 73 points. It took just 42 shots to get  there. In the fourth quarter, Wall scored 19 points. Beal scored four.  The rest of the team scored three. Washington advanced by winning on the  road. “We  came here with that focus and determination that we wanted to do the  same thing those guys did to us two years ago,” Wall said. “Me and Brad  led the way. We locked in. Our teammates understood what we had (to do).  We didn’t want to have a Game 7.” Boston  presents a more defensively firm backcourt than Atlanta did. Avery  Bradley and Marcus Smart are bigger, more interested in defense and  simply better at it than the Hawks duo of Dennis Schroder and Tim  Hardaway Jr. Instead of facing guys who are working toward being two-way  players, Wall and Beal will be challenged by two of the best perimeter  defenders in the league. The  wrinkle in that mix is Isaiah Thomas, Boston’s small, shifty,  score-first point guard who has worked his way from “Mr. Irrelevant” as  the final pick of the 2011 draft to a two-time All-Star and soul of the  Celtics. Tragedy entered Thomas’ life at the start of the playoffs when  his sister, Chyna, was killed in a car accident in their hometown of  Federal Way, Wash. — a short trip outside of their hometown, Tacoma,  Wash. — just before the postseason began. He played through tears to  start the series. Friday night, he left from Chicago to attend his  sister’s funeral Saturday. Chyna would have been 23 years old next week. Thomas  is listed as 5 foot 9, and in the past has joked there should be an  extra quarter inch on that measurement, though reality indicates the 69  inches may be generous to begin with. His size is a prolific benefit and  detriment. Thomas has long used thoughts about what he can’t do, often  predicated on his height, as motivation to turn into an unlikely  All-Star. But, his height is a defensive issue in the NBA and leaves  Boston coach Brad Stevens with a decision. In  the final game against Chicago, Boston started Thomas, Bradley, Gerald  Green, Crowder and Al Horford. Crowder is a 6-foot-6 “power forward” in  that alignment. As stern as he may be, playing against 6-foot-10  Markieff Morris would be a chore for Crowder, which means Amir Johnson,  who was benched in the Celtics’ first-round series, could be back in the  mix. Starting  Thomas and Bradley in the backcourt means Thomas needs to guard Wall,  Beal or possibly Otto Porter. If Thomas is on Porter, Bradley can move  to either Wall or Beal and defend them along with Crowder. Because of  injuries throughout the season, Boston never presented the same starting  lineup against Washington twice. In the final meeting, the most likely  Boston starters were used: Thomas, Bradley, Crowder, Johnson and  Horford. However, Johnson was a liability for the Celtics in the three  games he played against Washington. He averaged just 5 points and played  only 16.7 minutes per game. Jonas Jerebko and Kelly Olynyk are options  at his spot. Playing  the Celtics will present a new challenge for Marcin Gortat. Past his  first-round combat with Dwight Howard, Gortat will now face the more  mobile Horford. Washington thought Horford would be joining its  frontcourt in the offseason, but he chose Boston instead of the Wizards.  Horford’s versatility is key to the issues he presents. He took a  career-high 3.6 3-pointers per game this season. Gortat has improved at  guarding the league’s “stretch-five” players as the season has gone on. Seventeen  championship banners hang over each game played in Boston. Stevens  knows a championship-or-bust philosophy is not something just said in  Boston. It’s the way it is for the Celtics. They have not been to the  conference finals since 2012, have not won a title since 2008 and even  read how Stevens’ job security was trending downward when they trailed  Chicago 2-0. The  Wizards have one title. It arrived in 1978. The last time they made it  to the conference finals was 1979, disco, Carter, Volkswagen Beetles and  all that. They are not under the pressure of vaunted history. However,  what weighs on them is the failure of their last two playoff  appearances. They would revel in change coming at Boston’s expense.

Redskins take TE Jeremy Sprinkle from Arkansas with No. 154 overall pick
.B
With the No. 154 overall pick, their fifth-round selection, Redskins took tight end Jeremy Sprinkle in the NFL Draft Saturday. “It was pretty exciting,” Sprinkle said. “This has always been a big dream for me and to finally have it come true, this is a big moment right now.” Sprinkle played four years at Arkansas and became a regular starter as a senior in 2016. He is the program’s all-time leader for receiving touchdowns by a tight end with 11, and his four touchdowns as a senior tied for second in the SEC among tight ends. Sprinkle fits as an in-line tight end. His 6-5, 252-pound frame suits him well as a blocker and, though he’s not especially able as a route-runner, he performed well in the red zone and on underneath routes in college. “I would say it was definitely the most improved part of my game over my  career as far as developing as a tight end,” Sprinkle said of his in-line blocking. “This past season just being  able to being those gap schemes and everything like that, it really gave  me an opportunity to show that my in-line blocking was good so I feel  like that part of my game is good and solid.” Sprinkle was involved in a shoplifting incident at a Belk department store in Charlotte, N.C. in December. Arkansas was playing in the Belk Bowl, and players were given a gift card to the store worth $450, but Sprinkle attempted to take extra items from the store and wound up cited for unlawful concealment and suspended from the game. “I feel like it was a big disappointment for everyone around me,” Sprinkle said. Obviously it was something that was out of my character and I just  learned that you have to be the same person whether you think someone’s  watching or not.” Sprinkle played on Arkansas’ special teams units in his first three years but stopped as a senior when he became a regular starter. He joins a tight end room in Washington including Jordan Reed, Niles Paul and Vernon Davis. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

.B
WASHINGTON — The Washington Nationals placed outfielder Adam Eaton on the 10-day disabled list with a left knee strain. Eaton is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Saturday. “We’re hopeful it’s not as serious as it looked,” said manager Dusty Baker on Saturday. The 28-year-old stepped awkwardly on the bag when he beat out a throw to first in the ninth inning to load the bases in Friday night’s 7-5 loss to the New York Mets. Eaton fell down and needed assistance leaving the field. The center fielder is hitting .297 with two home runs and 13 RBIs. Eaton has reached base safely in 20 of 23 games since being acquired in an offseason trade with the Chicago White Sox. Shortstop Trea Turner will leadoff for the Nationals, while Michael A. Taylor will replace Eaton in the field. The Nationals also recalled outfielder Rafael Bautista from Triple-A Syracuse. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Redskins take Michigan State safety Montae Nicholson at No. 123 overall in draft
.B
The Redskins added safety Montae Nicholson, who played at Michigan State, with their second pick in the fourth round, No. 123 overall, of the NFL draft Saturday. Nicholson, 6-2 and 212 pounds, has all the physical traits scouts look for in a safety. He ran a 4.42-second 40-yard dash at NFL combine and was also a top performer in the broad jump. “Physical player, you know what I mean?” Nicholson said, describing  himself. “I like to run and hit people. I’m pretty fast, I’ve got good  range.” His on-field production with the Spartans, however, did not match up with his athletic potential. Nicholson made 200 tackles, four interceptions, four pass breakups, 4.5 tackles for loss, three fumble recoveries and one forced fumble in 38 career college games, but showed limited big-play ability and struggled with mental lapses and self-described confidence issues. “Once I get down there I’m going to dive right into the playbook as soon as possible. Learn all the plays,” Nicholson said. Nicholson had surgery on March 8 to repair a torn labrum. He said that he is on track to return for training camp and is ahead of schedule in his recovery.

Barry Trotz swaps Brett Connolly for Paul Carey in Game 2 against Penguins 
.B
Capitals coach Barry Trotz is making a change to his fourth line for Game 2 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Seldom-used center Paul Carey will replace forward Brett Connolly, whose minutes have decreased throughout the playoffs. Connolly will be inactive. Carey, 28, played in just six regular season games and has only played in three career playoff games. Carey has been with the Capitals since the 2015-16 season after playing two seasons with the Colorado Avalanche. Trotz said Carey is a “tremendous” skater with the ability to pressure and get to space. “What we’re trying to do, (Carey will) be a real good fit,” Trotz said. “He’s a hard worker. I just think he’ll get an opportunity. He hasn’t had that opportunity. When he’s gone in, he’s done a great job. Just looking for a little bit of a fit.” Trotz said he let Carey know last night about the change. Once finding out, Carey said he hardly slept. Game 2 will be Carey’s first playoff game as a Capitals player. “I’m very amped. It’s going to be a lot of fun,” Carey said. “It definitely wasn’t fun watching last year and being in the stands for that run, but I’m just glad to be able to be healthy and ready to go.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Redskins take S/LB Josh Harvey-Clemons, CB Josh Holsey in seventh round of draft
.B
With their final two selections of the NFL Draft, both in the seventh round, the Washington Redskins selected safety/linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons and cornerback Josh Holsey. The Redskins took Harvey-Clemons at No. 230 overall. Harvey-Clemons was a hybrid linebacker at Louisville and Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden said that the team plans to try him out at dime linebacker. As a seventh-rounder with 6-foot-4, 217-pound size, the Redskins can move him around and see what they can get out of him. “I’m willing to play anywhere. I played multiple positions at my former school, Louisville. I hope to do the same,” Harvey-Clemons said. Harvey-Clemons comes with some drug risk. He transferred to Louisville after two failed marijuana suspensions led to his dismissal from Georgia. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer, but came back to earn honorable mention All-ACC honors in 2015, his first year with the Cardinals. Most recently, Harvey-Clemons was a second-team all-conference pick with 61 tackles, four for loss and two sacks in 2016. With their final selection, the Redskins chose Holsey, from Auburn. The 5-foot-11, 217-pound cornerback was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, but ran an unofficial 4.43 in the 40-yard dash at his pro day, according to multiple reports. “I play ball through the wall every play,” Holsey said. “I  try to go as hard as I can. I watch a lot of film [and] I do the little things that matter at the end.” Holsey has recovered from two ACL tears which ended his 2013 and 2015 seasons in college, respectively. “A lot of guys can’t come back from two  ACL injuries and play as well I did,” Holsey said. “I was able to battle through  those. Injuries happen, so you have to be able to fight through and come  back. I feel like I did that and Washington and Coach [Torrian] Gray  and Coach [Jay] Gruden felt that as well and took  a chance for me.” Both players have experience on all special teams units.

Redskins select WR Robert Davis with No. 209 pick
.B
The Redskins added to their receiving corps in Day 3 of the NFL draft, selecting Robert Davis from Georgia State with the No. 209 overall pick. Davis, 6-foot-3 and 219 pounds, is Georgia State’s career leader in receptions (222) and receiving yards (3,391). Georgia State’s program is relatively new, having been founded in He had a career average of 15.3 yards per catch in college. “I’m an athletic receiver, a receiver that can help stretch the field,” Davis said. Davis is a cousin of Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis, who he said helped him through the pre-draft process and serves as a mentor. “He’s just been a guy who’s been in my corner the whole time letting me know all the ins and outs to know what’s going on. I mean, he’s just been a guy that’s kept me motivated and has always been there to tell me right from wrong,” Davis said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

British heavyweight boxing star Joshua knocks out Klitschko
.B
LONDON (AP) — Anthony Joshua survived the first knockdown of his young career, coming back to drop Wladimir Klitschko twice before stopping him in the 11th round Saturday night to retain his heavyweight titles. Before a boisterous crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium, Joshua and Klitschko traded huge punches and showed grit before Joshua finally found a way to finish the longtime former champion. It was anybody’s fight when Joshua landed a right uppercut early in the 11th round that spun Klitschko’s head around. He was all over the Ukrainian and dropped him with a left hook, but Klitschko got up only to take even more punishment. Joshua knocked Klitschko down again and was landing punches to his head on the ropes when referee David Fields moved in to stop the bout late in the 11th round.Joshua defended his heavyweight titles, winning for the 19th time in as many fights in a bout that lived up to its billing as the best heavyweight fight in more than a decade.

Redskins make first selection on offense, add running back Perine in fourth round
.B
Adding a player on the offensive side of the ball for the first time in the 2017 draft, the Redskins selected running back Samaje Perine with the No. 114 overall pick, their fourth-rounder, Saturday. At 5-11 and 233 pounds, Perine is a tough, durable downhill runner who could help the Redskins at the goal-line. “I would much prefer to go through you then around you,” Perine said. Perine is Oklahoma’s all-time leading rusher, with 4,122 yards in three seasons, and holds the NCAA single-game rushing record for a 427-yard performance against Kansas in 2014. His durability is an asset, particularly for the Redskins who were without running back Matt Jones for all but seven games of the 2016 season. Perine rushed for 1,060 yards and 12 scores in a second-team all-Big 12 effort at Oklahoma last year, where he split time out of the backfield with fellow running back Joe Mixon. He said he is working on making people miss and has made progress there, though it is not his strong suit. He has a baseline level of pass-catching comfort and decent hands, but has little in-game experience using them. Perine hadn’t had a ton of contact with the Redskins beyond speaking with the team at the Combine. He said owner Daniel Snyder called him to inform him he was Washington’s selection, then passed the phone around to several coaches. The selection the Redskins used to take Perine originally belonged to the Jets, so the Redskins still have another selection to make in the fourth round, barring trades.

Redskins keep adding on defense, select cornerback Fabian Moreau with No. 81 pick
.B
The  Redskins made their third-consecutive selection on the defensive side of  the ball Friday, selecting cornerback Fabian Moreau with the No. 81  overall pick, their third-round selection. Moreau,  who played five years at UCLA, is speedy and physical. The 6-foot,  206-pound former running back ran a 4.35-second 40-yard dash at the NFL  Scouting Combine and is happiest winning one-on-one matchups on the  outside. “His change of direction, his ball skills, speed, I think upside is the key to Fabian,” Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. Moreau,  who was honorable mention All-Pac-12 as a redshirt senior in 2016 after  recovering from a Lisfranc injury that kept him off the field for most  of his 2015 season, defined himself by his aggressive traits. “I’m  a physical, press corner,” Moreau said. “I like to get in the  receiver’s face. I like to challenge them. I like to make plays, and  just be that dog out there helping my team win.” Moreau  tore his pectoral muscle bench pressing at his Pro day on March 22 and  required surgery. He was considered a fringe first-round prospect, so  the injury may have helped push him down the board to the point that the  Redskins were able to take him in the third round. “I  just wanted to go out there and compete and compete with my teammates  one last time. I just wanted to show everybody that I’m the top corner  in this draft. Obviously I got hurt, but I just took it one step at a  time,” Moreau said. Moreau  said he was told that his rehab process would take five months. He  hopes to be back in time for training camp, which begins July 27. That’s  just over four months after the injury, so Moreau would have to beat  his prognosis in order to do that. Gruden said that his expectation was  for Moreau to be back by September. Pectoral  tears do not typically have long-term impact, however and Moreau, if  healthy, projects as a player who could make an impact on Washington’s  secondary in his first season. “This  is just everything to me. I’ve been wanting this my whole life,” Moreau said. “I’m  just ready to contribute, ready to win and ready to be a Redskin.” With  the pick, Washington continued to bolster its needy defense. The  Redskins had already taken a pair of Alabama defensive players in  defensive lineman Jonathan Allen and outside linebacker Ryan Anderson in  the first and second rounds, respectively. The  last time the Redskins selected three defensive players with their  first three picks was 2009, when the team took DE/LB Brian Orakpo in the  first round, CB Kevin Barnes in the third round and LB Cody Glenn in  the fifth round. The last time the Redskins selected a defensive player  in each of the first three rounds was 1997, when they took DE Kenard  Lang, LB Greg Jones and LB Derek Smith.

John Wall scores 42 points, Wizards eliminate Hawks
.B
ATLANTA — John Wall scored 42 points, Bradley Beal added 31 and the Washington Wizards withstood a furious Atlanta comeback to close out the Hawks with a 115-99 victory Friday night, winning the opening-round playoff series 4-2. The Hawks fell behind by 22 early in the third quarter before making a game of it down the stretch. But the home team never led, and Wall stymied the rally with huge plays at both ends of the court. Wall’s block of Dennis Schroder’s layup kept the Hawks from closing within a single point, and Wall hit every big shot in the closing minutes. He scored 19 points in the fourth quarter, ensuring that Washington picked up the first road victory by either team in the series. The Wizards advanced to face top-seeded Boston in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Celtics closed out the Bulls 4-2 with a 105-83 victory in Chicago. Paul Millsap led the Hawks with 31 points, and Schroder had 26. After losing three close games in Washington, the Hawks seemed to run out of steam in the return to Philips Arena, ending a disappointing season. Washington pushed out to a double-digit lead late in the first quarter, and closed the first half on a 19-4 run to take a 65-46 lead at the break. The Hawks turned the ball over six times during that five-minute stretch, making things easy for the Wizards. Atlanta finished with 22 turnovers, including seven by Kent Bazemore. But it was Wall, still seething over a second-round loss to the Hawks two years ago in which he was sidelined with a broken hand, taking control in the final period. The turning point came with Atlanta on the cusp of coming all the way back. With his team trailing 93-90, Schroder came up with a steal and took off for what looked like an uncontested layup. But Wall swooped in from behind and batted the ball off the backboard. At the other end, Wall somehow got a stumbling drive to fall, further silencing a crowd that was in a frenzy as the home team rallied. Atlanta’s Jose Calderon missed a 3-pointer, and Wall knocked down a pullup jumper to stretch the lead back to 97-90. The Hawks called timeout, and Wall stared down the fans at courtside before heading to the Washington bench. After Wall’s huge block, Washington outscored Atlanta 22-9 to win going away. TIP-INS Wizards: F-C Jason Smith was able to play after leaving Game 5 with a sprained left knee. “Give our staff a lot of credit,” coach Scott Brooks said. “There was definitely a chance that he wasn’t going to play.” Smith went 12 minutes, failing to score. … Markieff Morris finally managed to stay out of foul trouble. He scored 17 points, grabbed eight rebounds and picked up only two fouls. Hawks: C Dwight Howard, a non-factor most of the series, started out aggressively and seemed determined to have a big game. It didn’t last. He finished with nine points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes. … Tim Hardaway Jr. had 13 points on 5-of-18 shooting. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Redskins take outside linebacker Ryan Anderson with second-round pick
.B
With the No. 49 pick, the Redskins completed an Alabama double-dip by selecting outside linebacker Ryan Anderson in the second-round Friday night. The Redskins had already selected defensive lineman Jonathan Allen in the first round on Thursday, with the No. 17 pick, Anderson’s college teammate with the Crimson Tide. Just as he did with Allen, Washington coach Jay Gruden made the call to deliver the news to Allen. “I can’t explain it, man. That’s the first time I’ve had that call, that’s something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid, man,” Anderson said. Anderson, 6-foot-2 and 253 pounds, is a smart, sturdy player who knows how to use his hands and leverage to beat opponents he might not be able to with sheer physicality. “He brings an attitude to this football team,” Gruden said. “I had a chance to talk to him in Tuscaloosa, spent a lot of time with him watching him play, talked to a couple of his teammates, obviously we drafted one yesterday. Nothing but high praise for him not only on the field but his leadership, and his tenacity.” A unanimous All-SEC first team selection as a senior for the Crimson Tide, Anderson totaled 61 tackles, including a team-high 19.0 tackles for loss, 9.0 sacks and 10 quarterback hurries, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and three pass breakups. Anderson thrived in Alabama’s 3-4, so playing outside linebacker in Washington’s base defense should come easily to him. Anderson, though, doesn’t seem terribly worried about specifics. “I’m a playmaker, man, I’m a game-changer,” Anderson said. “I’m a good teammate, I’m a good dude to have in the locker room. I’m the ultimate football player. I’m not a combine warrior, I’m not a workout warrior, I’m a football player.” Anderson ran a 4.78 40-yard dash at the combine, which led to some doubts about his ability in coverage. He is more menacing than fluid. He had been seen by many evaluators as a potential first-round talent. Accomplished with film more impressive than his measurables, Anderson is a player in the mold preferred by former general manager Scot McCloughan, who was quite fond of the phrase “football player” himself. Anderson has played for top-level teams his entire life, and missed only one practice in his entire time at Alabama. “I’m working to set my own mold and break that mold,” he said. “I’m going to be the best outside linebacker in the game.

Josh Edgin saves Mets’ win over Nationals as Bryce Harper hits into DP
.B
Josh Edgin relieved Mets closer Jeurys Familia with the bases loaded in the ninth inning and got Bryce Harper to hit into a game-ending double play, finishing a 7-5 victory over the Washington Nationals on Friday night that stopped New York’s six-game losing streak. New York had lost 10 of 11 and put star slugger Yoenis Cespedes on the disabled list before the game with a strained hamstring. Travis d’Arnaud then homered twice and had five RBIs for the Mets, who were clinging to a two-run lead when they brought in Familia. Matt Wieters singled leading off, and Adam Lind’s single sent pinch runner Joe Ross to third. Adam Eaton followed with an infield single to shortstop and injured his left ankle as he stepped on first base. Eaton needed to be helped off the field and was replaced by pinch runner Chris Heisey. Familia struck out Trea Turner, and Mets manager Terry Collins brought in Edgin, a left-hander, to face the left-handed-hitting Harper. Harper hit a one-hopper to Edgin, who threw home for a forceout, and d’Arnaud threw to first for the double play, giving Edgin his second big league save and first since 2013. D’Arnaud hit a two-run homer in the second and a three-run drive in the fourth off Max Scherzer (3-2), who lasted six innings. Jacob deGrom (1-1) struck out 12 in his third consecutive double-digit strikeout game and the 13th of his career. Ryan Zimmerman homered twice for the Nationals, who had won 10 of their previous 11. Zimmerman tied Andre Dawson for second on the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals franchise list with 225. After giving up two home runs in the second, deGrom (1-1) encountered little trouble during the rest of his seven-inning stint. The right-hander retired 15 of the last 19 batters he faced, including nine via strikeout. TRAINER’S ROOM Mets: Collins did not know much more on Cespedes’ prognosis. “It’s probably better news than we thought,” he said of the MRI. “It’s still going to be awhile, obviously, but it’s in a different part of (the hamstring) where the injury was last week.” … The Mets recalled LHP Sean Gilmartin from Triple-A Las Vegas to take Cespedes’ roster spot. Nationals: LHP Sammy Solis (left elbow inflammation) had an MRI. Solis (0-0, 8.31) was placed on the DL on April 19. “We wanted to ease his mind, we wanted to ease the training staff’s mind,” manager Dusty Baker said. “It’s not getting progressively better with rest.” UP NEXT Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (1-2, 5.40), who gave up four runs in seven innings against the Nationals on Sunday in his longest outing since 2014, gets another chance to face Washington. Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (2-0, 2.89), who has pitched at least seven innings in each of his four starts this season, is on the mound Saturday after coming off the paternity leave list.

D.C. native Jalen Tabor selected by Lions in 2nd round
.B
ALLEN PARK, Mich. — The Detroit Lions have selected their second-straight Florida Gator, taking cornerback Jalen Tabor in the second round with the No. 53 overall pick in the NFL Draft on Friday night. Detroit desperately needs a cornerback to play on the opposite side of standout Darius Slay and Tabor seems suited for the job. The Lions also addressed a need Thursday by using the No. 21 pick on Florida linebacker Jarrad Davis, who can play against the run or the pass, after releasing injury-prone linebacker DeAndre Levy. Tabor was expected to be a first-round pick until his lackluster showing at the combine and Florida’s pro day. He ran a 4.62 40-yard dash in Indianapolis and was even slower - running in the 4.7s - inside the Gators’ practice facility. SEE ALSO: On eve of NFL draft, Jalen Tabor touches base with D.C. roots He skipped his final year of college eligibility to enter the draft. Tabor, who is from Washington, D.C., had 33 tackles, four interceptions - one returned for a touchdown - and a sack last season. Detroit’s defense has been a priority so far in the draft after being largely overlooked in free agency. The franchise focused on offense, adding veteran linemen Rick Wagner and T.J. Lang to replace departing free agents Riley Reiff and Larry Warford early in the offseason. The Lions are hoping second-year general manager Bob Quinn can follow up his first draft with another successful series of picks this year. Quinn’s first four picks last year, starting with first-round offensive tackle Taylor Decker, all went on to play key roles during at least some stretches of last season. Detroit struggled to make game-changing plays on defense last year and has been looking for playmakers on that side of the ball. Its search, clearly, included a couple of former Gators. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

On eve of NFL draft, Jalen Tabor touches base with D.C. roots
.B
It’s about 10 a.m. on Wednesday outside Friendship Collegiate Academy, a charter school in Northeast D.C. that Jalen Tabor used to use the buddy system to get to without getting jumped. For this particular arrival, a white Chevrolet Suburban pops a U-turn to drop him off right outside. Things are changing fast. A back door opens and out slides the 21-year-old cornerback, one red Jordan sneaker at a time. He’s wearing grey skinny jeans and a silky black bomber jacket with the punk band Sonic Youth’s “Confusion is Sex” album cover embroidered on the back. He has what looks like five pounds of gold chain jewelry around his neck and wrists. He’s days away from the NFL draft, where he is almost certain to be chosen. The door to the passenger seat swings open and, before the amount of time necessary to identify footwear passes, Merri Tabor exits the vehicle and marches past her son toward the school. She enrolled Jalen at Friendship in 2010, she arranged for him to speak to the football team today and she is in charge here. “She’s pretty much the head on the rocket and she tells me and [Jalen] what to do,” says Alex Patel, Merri’s husband and Jalen’s stepfather. Jalen was born and raised in Bowie, Md., but, after meeting Aazaar Abdul-Rahim, the Maryland defensive backs coach who was then the football coach at Friendship, Merri decided that she and Jalen would move to D.C. so that her son could play for Abdul-Rahim. She got a job transfer but her husband had to stay behind meaning that, for a time, they were paying bills in two places. “I was determined for [Jalen] to be successful,” she says. Merri was there for every breakfast and dinner and was always available to talk to Jalen’s coaches, but she couldn’t protect him from their new environment in what was one of D.C.’s most crime-ridden neighborhoods. “It was a culture shock,” Jalen says. “You go from the suburbs to the city. It taught me a lot.” After Jalen was robbed a second time, Merri made sure that older friends would make the trips to school with him. She would pick him up from practice. Jalen lost two friends in shootings, and says he learned to act calm and deferential around people he knew were carrying guns. Friendship’s football team practiced on a dirt field they dubbed ‘The Beach.’ It wasn’t a playable game field, so they played every game on the road. Old needles were a hazard. Jalen thrived anyway. He didn’t allow a completion in his direction as a junior. In 2014 as a senior, he was D.C.’s Mr. Football and the No. 4-rated cornerback prospect according to ESPN. When the colleges came calling, Jalen got offers from more than two dozen schools including Alabama, Clemson, Michigan, Ohio State, Notre Dame, LSU and Arizona. Jalen enjoys glitz, and he loved his visit to Arizona — the girls, the parties, the weather, everything just seemed better there — but Merri said no. She thought Florida, and the SEC, would provide him with a better education and a safer path to the NFL. For two weeks straight, she burst into tears telling him so every night until Jalen gave in and flipped his commitment. At Florida, Jalen broke up 33 passes in his three years, sixth-most in program history. He was first team All-SEC twice. In his last two seasons in Gainesville Jalen totaled eight interceptions and returned three of them for touchdowns, a byproduct of the instincts and vision scouts love about him. Most projections have him going in the second or third round of the draft. Jalen had been seen as a first-rounder, potentially even a top-10 pick, before he ran a 4.62 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and followed it up with an even slower time at Florida’s Pro Day — the one Bill Belichick ditched the NFL’s annual meetings to attend. Jalen says a sore hamstring impacted his times. The whole family told him not to run, but Jalen did anyway. “It’s a toss-22,” Merri said. “Do you not run and then drop to the third round? Do you run it with a bad hamstring and try?” All 32 teams have letters from Jalen’s doctor and trainer in Florida, Merri says, and they’ve been assured repeatedly that Jalen’s game film is far more important than his measurables. Jalen would love to be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, he says. He loves the Redskins but thinks they’re set at cornerback. Jalen will watch the draft from home, with his mom, stepdad, girlfriend and maybe a few friends. For a guy that doesn’t mind the spotlight, he doesn’t want to make a big deal out of the draft. This has been a taxing process. “We just try not to think about it. There’s so much scrutiny in the media these days. It’s so many negative things,” Merri says. “It’s a tough time … You’re in that balance. People don’t understand.” Paying it forward Jalen takes the stage at his old school and faces the assemblage of adolescent boys slouching in their Friendship jackets and their navy-and-gold ties, which none of them have tied correctly. They slouch because they are 16-or-so, not because they are not riveted. A few of Jalen’s many sides come through clearly as he answers their questions. He is confident: “I’m pretty sure you all know who I am,” he says after getting on stage. He goes the entire session without introducing himself by name. He has a sense of humor: “You’re gonna talk to one girl way different than you’re gonna talk to the next girl,” he says, explaining the nuances of covering shifty slot receivers versus outside burners. The teenagers laugh a little, but they mostly take this advice as Gospel. He gets ahead of himself sometimes: “I want to own a team or be a GM,” he says.  Seconds before, he’d said that he hasn’t given much thought to life after his playing career. Jalen wants to be better than his idol, Deion Sanders, both as a player and as a showman. He jumps from topic to topic, smiling widely and speaking freely. This is not out of character. While at Florida, Jalen commented on topics ranging from displeasure with the Florida athletic department to the police shooting death of Alton Sterling on his Twitter account. He is outspoken, and thinks athletes have an obligation to be that way. “We’ve got to do a better job of speaking out for what’s right and not being quiet because we’re getting paid a lot of money to be quiet,” he says. An African-American studies major who plans on finishing his degree the summer after his rookie NFL season, Jalen says he never felt the direct impact of racism as a player at Florida, but noticed its effect on the community around him. “They shelter us because we’re making money for them,” he says. He mentions that Gainesville is not far from the prison in Raiford, where the state’s death row inmates are housed. While at Florida, Jalen gradually realized that most of the faces he saw on local news coverage had skin shaded like his. He’s not sure what he would do if he were forced to choose between an NFL contract and the freedom to speak his mind, but he has a plan in place to avoid facing that choice. “I’m going to play so well and I’m going to be such a good person that they’re not going to be able to get me out of there,” he says. Jalen wants to control his own image, and he is already good at marketing himself. When he did not go to SEC Media Day in 2016, he held his own via Periscope. He declared for the draft in January and announced his decision in a goodbye letter to Florida published in the Players’ Tribune. He admires the Ball brothers, Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo, whose father LaVar has made headlines this year for, among other things, a war of words with Nike. LaVar Ball issued a public warning that BBB, the apparel brand he created in his kids’ honor, will one day eat into the marketplace that Nike, Adidas and Under Armour currently dominate. “I think that’s amazing,” Tabor says. “I feel like that’s what I want to do, have my own cleat one day and stuff like that. Your own brand? That’s what’s best. You don’t want to be a part of somebody else’s brand.” Insider and outsiders There’s a man in a black shirt, black pants and a black hat with a green gator on the cap hanging out by the door of the auditorium. That’s Ty. Midway through last season, Merri decided it was worthwhile to have someone with Jalen 24-7. “People think I’m crazy,” she says. That includes Jalen, who sometimes doesn’t like having Ty, a family friend, come with him every time he goes out. “Just protecting his best interest,” Merri says. “You hear about all of these bad stories coming up this week, and it’s really bad this year. Kids getting into a fight at a bar, that was actually his teammate [Caleb Brantley], another kid who did something in a hotel room.” “If you have that, someone there that’s looking out for you, those things either won’t occur or they’re consciously thinking ‘Let’s go. You can’t hit her back,’ or ‘You’ve gotta go.’ You know what I mean? ‘You can’t be doing this.’ And that’s important. People don’t realize that that’s very, very important. It may seem like babysitting but hey,” she says. Ty is not here because Merri doesn’t think Jalen knows right from wrong. She is sure he does, because she made sure during those days when it was just the two of them living down the street from Friendship on South Dakota Avenue. Jalen’s days of football practice and class were followed up by life lessons with Merri. A sample of her curriculum: “Women 101, Guns 101, Drugs 101,” she says. “We’d sit down and I’d say, ‘Can you carry this pill without this prescription cup?’ People don’t know that,” Merri says. “If you put, let’s just say Oxycodone or Tylenol 3, because sometimes he would take Tylenol for his body, can you carry that around without the prescription bottle?” “Well of course he said yes, because he didn’t know, but you can’t, that’s illegal. Just little stuff like that,” she says. How to handle money was a major topic before Jalen went to college. It will become one again once he signs his first NFL contract. They’ve already had conversations about saving for the future and about how a second contract isn’t guaranteed but they haven’t “in-depthed it” yet, Merri says. Money is also a major reason Jalen’s family thinks having Ty around is a good idea. The months leading up to the draft are full of outsiders looking for an in with a soon-to-be millionaire. “He’s got a big heart, he can’t say no, and we can’t be there,” Patel says. Jalen does have a history of getting into trouble, though nothing that would give an NFL team major pause. Tabor was cited for marijuana possession once and suspended twice, once for reportedly refusing to take a drug test and a second time for fighting with teammate C’yontai Lewis in practice. He missed both the 2015 and 2016 season openers as a result. With every incident, he’s had to place a call home to Merri. “I didn’t want to, but I had to,” Jalen says. Asked what words were typically exchanged on those calls, Jalen exhales sharply. His eyes widen and he shakes his head. “A whole bunch of stuff,” is all he says. A call with bad news, though, is better than no call at all. “I’d rather him call me and we put out the fire than him be scared and me get nervous,” Merri says. “I’ve never been nervous any time I’ve gotten a phone call because that just makes kids say, ‘Oh, I’m not calling her.’ You know? And so I’d rather have that.” Jalen said there was a time when he didn’t have to call, though, that proved to be a pivotal moment. He hadn’t stopped smoking after his marijuana citation and, one day, while gassing up his car, police officers showed up. He saw them coming and quickly stuffed the little bag of contraband he had on him into the gas compartment. The officers searched his vehicle thoroughly, dumping out the bag of chips and can of soda he had in the front seat. But they never checked the gas compartment. Jalen said thinking about what might have happened after his second offense scared him straight. “I just [saw] all the plays in college flash before my eyes,” he says. One more lesson Jalen takes pictures, signs autographs and passes out Florida Gators wristbands with the gaggle of students who stayed behind after he finished speaking. Soon the group is told to get to class, and to walk quietly on their way there. Jalen asks about an old teacher. “She still up on the third floor?” Jalen’s hope is to start a charter school in D.C., just like Friendship, once his NFL earnings start coming in. He and Merri have prepared a patent application for the name New Foundations D.C., which is what they want to call the school. “If I can give these kids a little bit of light to help their situation that means the world to me,” Jalen says. In Merri’s mind, she sees Jalen walking the halls of New Foundations waving to students, or heading out to watch football practice. She of all people understands that her son would not be where he is without the help of others, and it’s important to her that he pays it forward. The school has a secondary purpose, too. It’s a constructive project, something Jalen can focus on in the limited time he has that isn’t consumed by football, and a reminder that he doesn’t play in the pursuit of luxury alone. “Keeping his mind straight and making sure that he remembers that there’s more to life than just football, there’s more to life than just the glamour,” she said. “Let’s keep concentration on where we came from, make sure we’re able to give back, stay focused. You’re on a platform. Everybody is watching and you’ve got to remember that because they look up to you.” As she talks, her language morphs. At first she is describing what she wants for her son. But gradually, it becomes clear she is still speaking directly to Jalen — a mom trying to squeeze in one last life lesson before the pros call. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Winter storm hampers NCAA travel, hits cherry blossoms 
.B
That’s Stella, as in Stella the double-fisted winter storm that’s threatening to punch her way from the Plains eastward before moving into Maine. It seems the last laugh isn’t on those of you who took the word of prognosticator Shipoke Sheena over trusty-dusty Punxsutawney Phil. After all, Sheena is merely a dog in groundhog’s clothing while Phil is the real deal. Phil saw his shadow on Feb. 2 (remember?), predicting six more weeks of winterlike weather. Now along comes Stella — or, more acutely, STELLA!!! (The storm that’s forecast to deliver a blow the mid-Atlantic and move straight on to New England is worthy of my best Marlon Brando impression.) As with any winter storm, Stella’s whipping skirt tails are expected to disrupt our daily routines, including happy hour. However, she’s also going to disrupt our planned activities — and why not. As the humorous insider saying goes, “If you want to see God laugh, tell him your plans.” The cherry blossoms are in bloom again. The first four NCAA match-ups begin Tuesday, and the first dance to the Division I championship tips off on Thursday in Buffalo, New York, where snow and below-zero temps are winter staples. “There’s concern about the Buffalo site,” Mark Hollis, chairman of the NCAA Division I men’s basketball committee, said Sunday. “The process is, we’re trying to get everyone in earlier. We’re maneuvering with our travel agents to make that happen for teams and officials.” The schools’ students and fans need to get to those games safely, too. You do not, of course, have to be a hoops fan to appreciate his concern for safety. Travel agents for Jane and John HittheroadJack are on the lookout for warmer climates and, with spring break around the corner, they and their college-age dependents are looking for a break. Fortunately, airlines learned over the weekend that Stella could get her groove on. Airlines already have canceled more than 4,000 flights. The really good news is that the airlines also have granted waivers, but please — please — check with your carrier because there are stipulations. As for the cherry blossoms, chalk it up to trying to fool Mother Nature, who granted a warmer-than-usual winter that led National Park Service predictors to push the peak-bloom dates to Tuesday through Friday. Then, Stella blew that down. Now, the peak date changed to Sunday through March 22. Perhaps Punxsutawney Phil read the “Old Farmers Almanac” before venturing out for his prediction. The Almanac, established in 1792, offered a head’s up. Its prediction was “March 12-20: Periods of rain and snow, cold.” And so it is. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump skeptical of Obama’s political boast

President-elect Donald Trump took aim at President Obama’s political prowess Tuesday, pointing out that Mr. Obama couldn’t sway voters in key battleground states during the presidential campaign. “President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. The president said in an interview broadcast on Monday that he believes he would have won a third term against Mr. Trump if he had run again. The Constitution forbids presidents from serving more than two terms. But Mr. Trump pointed out that Mr. Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton in swing states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump won. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Congress to boost troop levels, duck gay-rights fight in final defense bill
.B
Congress agreed to boost the active-duty strength of the military and maintain a ban on shipping terrorism suspects from Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. in the annual defense policy bill, negotiators said Tuesday — though lawmakers punted on a major fight over gay rights and federal contractors. Republicans had sought to roll back an executive order banning federal contractors from discrimination based on sexual orientation but retreated in the final deal, believing they can win that fight with the new Trump administration instead. “New paths have opened up to address those issues,” a staffer said in briefing reporters on the final agreement, which will be made public on Wednesday and is slated for a vote in the House on Friday. The defense policy bill, known officially as the National Defense Authorization Act, is considered the only must-pass bill of the year, and is always saved for the end of the year to serve as a catchall for unresolved fights. This year, with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, and with President Obama on his way out and about to cede power to a Republican, the final negotiations were made easier. Mr. Obama had threatened to veto earlier versions of the bill over what he saw as meddling with his ability to run the Defense Department. Negotiators said they dropped all of those fights. The only potential sticking point is the bill’s authorized price tag, which is $3.2 billion higher than the White House had sought. Mr. Obama and fellow Democrats didn’t object to spending more on defense, but had insisted it be tied to a corresponding increase in domestic funding — something that doesn’t appear likely. Negotiators avoided a number of tricky issues, including halting a push to have women register for the selective service military draft. The bill that cleared the Senate in June would have required female registration, while the House bill initially had a similar provision that was dropped before it cleared that chamber. The final House-Senate agreement only calls for a study on the effectiveness of the draft. The new bill also breathes life into a special visa program designed to provide a pathway into the U.S. for Afghan citizens who risked their lives helping American forces in the war there. Some 1,500 new visas have been made available, with Afghans engaged in the most dangerous duties getting priority, negotiators said. In terms of personnel, the new agreement would require the army to have at least 476,000 active-duty troops next year, which is a boost of 1,000 over 2016 — but is 16,000 more than Mr. Obama had called for. At 185,000, the Marine Corps has 3,000 more active-duty troops than the president sought, and the Air Force will be 4,000 higher, at 321,000 troops. To pay for the higher troop strength yet contain costs, negotiators said they put off spending on ships and aircraft. The staffers who briefed reporters on the deal said it’s tougher to build back troop strength than it is to kick-start production on equipment. “This is a victory for common sense,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, who had urged his colleagues to forgo a “culture wars” fight on the defense bill. “It’s encouraging to see Congress do its work instead of jumping into a fight about drafting our mothers, sisters and daughters when the military isn’t demanding an end to our all-volunteer fighting force.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Tim Ryan of Ohio to challenge Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader
.B
Rep. Tim Ryan announced Thursday that he will challenge Rep. Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the House Democratic Caucus, giving the party’s moderates a rallying point as they try to drag the party back toward the center after last week’s elections. Mr. Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, will struggle to topple Mrs. Pelosi, who said she had commitments from two-thirds of House Democrats. Mr. Ryan doesn’t have much time to peel away her support — the vote is scheduled for Nov. 30, and lawmakers will be in recess next week for the Thanksgiving holiday. But his announcement underscores growing unrest with Mrs. Pelosi, who has helmed House Democrats for 14 years and rarely faced dissent. PHOTOS: 13 Things Liberals Want To Ban “Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929,” Mr. Ryan said in announcing his bid. “This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections.” He said Democrats have lost touch with Americans in the middle of the country — particularly in the Midwest and Rust Belt, which used to be the party’s blue-collar strength. Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania voted for Republican Donald Trump for president, and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania re-elected Republican senators. Overall, Democrats had a bad night, losing the White House, failing to retake either the Senate or House, and sustaining further losses in state legislatures. Mrs. Pelosi shrugged off accusations that she was responsible for the poor showing. The California Democrat said she proved she could lead her party to a majority when it took control in 2007. She said its failure to retake the chamber last week was the fault of others, including FBI Director James B. Comey, who made a late campaign season decision to renew his agency’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Mrs. Pelosi said her party had the right positions for voters but failed to convey the message. “The problem is more with the communication than it was with our policy,” she said. She said the Democratic majority from 2007 through 2011 was never as strong as it seemed because it was infiltrated by a “big boll weevil faction” of conservative Democrats. She remains a clear favorite to win the Nov. 30 vote. “Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me,” she told reporters at a press briefing Thursday on Capitol Hill. “It’s a funny thing in a caucus or any place when somebody challenges you. Your supporters turn out both internally in the caucus and in the country, whether it’s supporters at the grass-roots level, financial supporters, intellectual resources to us.” Undeterred, Mr. Ryan entered the race hours later, lamenting that Democrats have less power now than at any other time in decades. “We have lost over 60 seats since 2010. We have the fewest Democrats in state and federal offices since Reconstruction,” he said. “At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership.” The liberal group MoveOn.Org quickly endorsed Mrs. Pelosi and rejected the notion that the party needed to move to the center. “Progressives are also counting on congressional Democrats to express a populist and inclusive vision for the future that speaks to Americans across lines of race, class and geography,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “We believe that Nancy Pelosi is best positioned to lead House Democrats in this direction, and support her candidacy for Democratic leader.” Christy Setzer, a Democratic strategist, said the showdown in the House Democratic caucus is part of a broader battle over how best to respond to the electoral setback. “Democrats are conducting their autopsy of 2016, and many like Rep. Ryan are taking to heart the lesson that we can’t be a party of coastal so-called ‘elites’ — and must do more to reach the working-class voters who once made up our base,” Mrs. Setzer said. “But it’s a tricky line to walk: The party also can’t ignore the diverse rising majority who are being alienated by the right. It’s not a zero-sum game — we can and must entice both groups.” The National Republican Campaign Committee, meanwhile, rushed to the defense of Mrs. Pelosi, saying, in jest, “No single person deserves more credit for House Republicans’ historic majority than Nancy Pelosi.” “Under Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, House Democrats have become completely irrelevant, and there is no better way to ensure that remains the case than by keeping her as minority leader,” NRCC Communications Director Katie Martin said. “The NRCC offers its full support to Nancy Pelosi as she attempts to fend off this challenge to her failed leadership from within the ranks of her own party.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Samuel L. Jackson says he isn’t moving to South Africa despite Trump victory
.B
South Africans were looking forward to seeing whether actor Samuel L. Jackson would turn up after Republican Donald Trump’s presidential win, but it looks like he’s staying put. Several South Africa news websites broke the news to readers this week after the star of movies like “The Hateful Eight” and “Pulp Fiction” informed Trump supporters needling him on social media that he wasn’t serious. “Sit down‚ we might have some bad news for you,” said the Herald Live in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. “It seems that veteran U.S. actor Samuel L. Jackson is in no hurry to leave America … even for South Africa.” Unlike other celebrities who have since reneged on their leaving-the-country pledges, however, Mr. Jackson has a legitimate excuse: He made his comment about moving to South Africa during a sketch in December on ABC-TV’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” in which he played the voice of the “hateful eight ball.” Asked during the skit to predict if Mr. Trump would be the next president, Mr. Jackson replied, “If that mother–– becomes president, I’m moving my black a— to South Africa.” Reminded of his comment by persistent social-media followers, Mr. Jackson said on Twitter, “When you learn the difference between My Actual Opinion & A Kimmel Skit … Maybe we can talk.” Later, an exasperated Jackson told Splash News TV, “Look, everybody keeps saying I said I was leaving.” “I was doing a Jimmy Kimmel skit. I was portraying a Magic Eight Ball. You remember that? Did you see that? So why does everybody think that’s my personal opinion?” Mr. Jackson said in a video posted Thursday on YouTube. So far none of the two dozen celebrities vowing to leave the country in the event of a Trump presidency have followed through, at least not publicly. Those begging off include comedians Chelsea Handler and Amy Schumer, singer Miley Cyrus and the star of HBO-TV’s “Girls,” Lena Dunham. So far, no public word from celebrities such as Cher, Whoopi Goldberg and Barbra Streisand. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Jaguars stick with QB Blake Bortles, draft offensive help
.B
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles is getting another chance to turn his career around - and seemingly without competition. The Jaguars opted not to select a quarterback during the three-day NFL draft, a somewhat surprising decision considering Bortles’ continued struggles and the addition of Tom Coughlin as the team’s executive vice president of football operations. The 25-year-old Bortles returned to California last month to work on his mechanics, hoping to improve his accuracy and efficiency, and surely needs to refine his pre-snap reads and post-snap decisions. “I think you guys know how we feel about Blake,” said general manager Dave Caldwell, who drafted Bortles with the third pick in 2014. “We’ve got a lot of new eyes on Blake from a new coaching staff and have gotten good feedback from those guys, guys that haven’t been around and who don’t have anything vested in the kid. We still think … he’s got a lot of room to improve.” The Jaguars, who are league-worst 17-63 over the last five seasons, brought back Coughlin to oversee football decisions and hired Doug Marrone as the franchise’s fifth head coach. Both expressed support for Bortles, but they really showed their hand in the draft. They drafted bruising LSU running back Leonard Fournette with the fourth overall pick, chose massive Alabama left tackle Cam Robinson in the second round (No. 34) and added speedy yet troubled Oklahoma receiver Dede Westbrook in the fourth (No. 110). Fournette was one of the most talented backs in college football the last three years, running for 3,830 yards and 40 touchdowns while averaging 6.2 yards a carry. Robinson was the 2016 Outland Trophy recipient as the nation’s best lineman. Westbrook, who caught 80 passes for 1,524 yards and 17 touchdowns last season, was a Heisman Trophy finalist and the Biletnikoff Award winner as the nation’s top receiver. Westbrook slipped because of his baggage. And despite the Jaguars’ history of dealing with troubled receivers - Jimmy Smith, R. Jay Soward, Reggie Williams, Matt Jones and Justin Blackmon spent time in the NFL’s substance-abuse program - they took a chance on a guy with big-play ability. Westbrook was twice accused of domestic violence by the mother of two of his children, before he transferred to Oklahoma from Blinn Community College. The district attorney’s office rejected the first charge in 2012 and dropped the second one in 2013 because prosecutors could not locate the state’s witness. Westbrook was arrested a third time last May on a charge of criminal trespassing. “I felt like my past, I’ve grown up and I’ve learned a lot from it,” Westbrook said. “It made me a lot wiser and made me think things over, so every situation I go about, I think it through twice or three times and get someone else’s opinion and make sure it’s correct all the way around. For Jacksonville, I thank them for believing in me and I’m going to do everything that I possibly could to help this organization win.” Caldwell said Westbrook will be on a short leash. “It has to be behind him,” Caldwell said. “There’s no choice now. Obviously with Coach Marrone and Coach Coughlin here there’s no margin for error for him off the field. … I think we have done our due diligence enough to realize that is behind him and that, like we said, all of those charges were dropped. “I think we all have been accused of things, not all of us, but many of us have been accused of things. We don’t take it lightly. Obviously it is a serious issue, and we just feel like at this point in time to give the kid a chance to make it right.” And help Bortles, who threw for 3,905 yards, with 23 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, in his third season. It was a step back after throwing for 4,428 yards and 35 touchdowns in 2015. He has been sacked a whopping 140 times in three years and has the most turnovers (63) of any player during that span. “We need to do something about balance,” Coughlin said. “We need to do something about creating a better situation where the quarterback doesn’t have the entire game on his shoulders.” Jacksonville’s other picks Saturday: -Ohio linebacker Blair Brown (fifth round, No. 148 overall) will have a significant role on special teams while playing behind weak-side linebacker Telvin Smith. -Minnesota cornerback Jalen Myrick (seventh round, No. 222 overall) covered the 40-yard dash in 4.28 seconds at the NFL combine. He returned kickoffs and punts in college, and the Jaguars hope he will be a special teams ace. -Miami fullback Marquez Williams (seventh round, No. 240 overall) could end up paving the way for Fournette. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Receiver Jalen Robinette undrafted after Air Force ruling
.B
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) - Wide receiver Jalen Robinette, who led the nation at 27.4 yards per catch, went undrafted after the Air Force told him just this week that he’d have to serve two years in the military before being allowed to play in the NFL. Robinette, who is set to graduate from the Academy in less than a month, had prepared for the draft believing he’d be allowed to play in the NFL right away because of a U.S. Department of Defense ruling last summer . Robinette was informed Thursday night as the first round was underway that Air Force leaders had informed the academy that cadets would still be required to serve at least two years on active duty before being allowed to apply for the Ready Reserve, which would allow them to play professional sports. A projected mid-round pick, Robinson was the first Air Force player ever invited to the East-West Shrine Game, the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine. He maintained a full class load while commuting 100 miles six days a week to train with other hopefuls in suburban Denver included Stanford’s Christian McCaffrey. He’s on track to graduate May 24. After Navy standout quarterback Keenan Reynolds was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens last year, the defense department changed its policy for service academy athletes who are offered the opportunity to play professionally, saying they could receive reserve appointments upon graduation and start their pro careers immediately rather than having to serving two years of active duty first. In a statement, the Air Force said it informed the academy, however, that it “would not approve requests to waiver active duty military commitments for cadet athletes,” adding, “The Air Force places tremendous value on our cadet athletes and their contributions to the nation as we continue to build leaders of character, engage in combat operations overseas and continue to ensure our highest military readiness at home.” At a shade under 6-foot-4 and just shy of 220 pounds, Robinette reminds some scouts of Broncos star receiver Demaryius Thomas, who came out of Georgia Tech’s triple option offense. Robinette caught just 35 passes his senior season but they covered 959 yards for an NCAA-best 27.4-yard average , and he had six touchdown receptions. Over his four seasons for the Falcons, he caught 120 passes for 2,697 yards and 18 touchdowns. He told The Associated Press this spring that he realizes he could have gone to another school and put up bigger numbers but said he never regretted choosing Air Force, not even when he caught just 16 passes is freshman year nor when an NFL future first came into focus his junior year. He said he especially felt fortunate when the defense department changed its rules last year and he realized he could get both a great education and be able to fulfill his NFL dreams. “I knew I was in the right place despite the stats,” Robinette, who sports an Air Force lightning bolt tattoo on his left bicep, said back in February. “I’ve never been huge on stats. I just like to play.” Now he’ll have to wait until 2019. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL ___ Follow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

GREEN VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) - Officials say fire crews are gaining a handle on a southern Arizona wildfire that started Sunday. The Coronado National Forest and Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Saturday that the fire about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of the small city of Green Valley didn’t spread overnight. It has burned 73.4 square miles (190 square kilometers) of grass, brush and trees but as of Saturday morning was now 61 percent contained. Officials called it a success and said they’ll start to release some fire crew members. But hundreds of homes nearby that could be affected will remain under pre-evacuation notices. The U.S. Border Patrol said Thursday one of its agents was being investigating for possibly starting the fire while off duty and shooting a gun recreationally.

Authorities searched for hours until they spotted the animal trying to attack a house cat. Loken says they chose to shoot the animal to euthanize him because the mountain lion appeared to be hungry and could pose a danger to humans or pets. The mountain lion was shot about 4 a.m. Saturday. Loken says tranquilizers are often used but that the shooting was the safest, most humane thing to do. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

12 hazing complaints since 2014 confirmed at Marine base
.B
BEAUFORT, S.C. (AP) - Officials at the Marine Corps’ training base in South Carolina say half of 24 hazing complaints investigated since 2014 have been confirmed. The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette report Saturday (http://bit.ly/2oKf3TG ) that documents obtained through a public records request show the complaints involve all four of Parris Island’s training battalions. The newspapers have so far received heavily redacted documents from 15 investigations. Depot officials did not specify which were substantiated. Allegations of drill instructors hazing recruits ranged from denied bathroom breaks to serious physical assaults. One recruit said a drill instructor vomited on him. One investigation found a “staggering level of misconduct” and recommended three Marines for courts-martial after trainees reported being choked, hit in the face, kicked in the stomach, and slammed into walls by their drill instructors in February 2015. That case was among five involving the 3rd Recruit Training Battalion. That’s the same unit scrutinized following the March 2016 death of 20-year-old recruit Raheel Siddiqui, of Taylor, Michigan, who fell several stories from a barracks stairwell following an altercation with a drill instructor. The names of the accused drill instructors, recruits and interviewed witnesses were blacked out in the 15 files supplied to the newspapers. Parris Island officials did not say whether any drill instructors have been disciplined. But the Marine Corps has previously said a probe following Siddiqui’s death had identified up to 20 officers, drill instructors and other leaders who face administrative or potential criminal charges for taking part in misconduct or turning a blind eye to it. The base’s spokesman, Capt. Greg Carroll, said hazing is not widespread, noting about 60,000 recruits have received training at Parris Island over the last three years. He said steps the base has taken include adding assistant commanders to supervise drill instructors and recruits and regularly evaluating Marines on their knowledge of the “Recruit Training Order.” It defines hazing as “any activity which is cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning or harmful,” whether physical or psychological. The order also says training activities must accomplish a specific goal and can’t be used solely for confusing, disorienting or angering recruits. “Everything we do has to have intent,” said Maj. Steven Allshouse, director of Parris Island’s drill instructor school. ___ Information from: The Island Packet, http://www.islandpacket.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

PAHRUMP, Nev. (AP) - Authorities are searching for a suspect who they say left out poisoned meat near a Nevada park, killing two dogs and leaving three others in critical condition. The Nye County Sheriff’s office says Saturday that they were notified Wednesday of the five pets suffering from severe poisoning when they were taken to an animal hospital. The dog’s owners all live near Comstock Park in Pahrump, about an hour west of Las Vegas. They reported that their dogs ingested poisoned meat that was placed on their properties. Investigators are trying to identify what kind of poison was involved. Authorities also say the circumstances are strikingly similar to a series of dog poisonings that happened in 2015.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - AT&T says it will withdraw from a Kansas program that subsidizes landline telephone service for low-income residents. The Lawrence Journal-World reports (http://bit.ly/2pwbRdL ) most AT&T customers who participate in the Kansas Lifeline Service Program will no longer receive the subsidies after May 31. However, the company will offer the discounts in some, mostly rural areas that the Federal Communications Commission has designated as high-cost areas with little broadband service. The Kansas Lifeline Service Program offers up to $17 a month for local phone service to people who receive public assistance or meet income-eligibility guidelines. AT&T officials said customers served by the program have mostly moved to other carriers, particularly wireless services, for phone and internet access. The company says it now has just 6 percent of Lifeline subscribers in Kansas. ___ Information from: Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World, http://www.ljworld.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Cagle promises 500,000 new jobs in Georgia governor campaign
.B
ATLANTA (AP) - Casey Cagle will launch his campaign for governor on Sunday with a pledge to add half a million new jobs in Georgia in four years if voters choose him to replace term-limited Gov. Nathan Deal. Cagle’s decision isn’t a surprise; the three-term lieutenant governor long has been included on lists of potential candidates for 2018. He confirmed to The Associated Press ahead of a formal launch event planned for Sunday afternoon in Duluth. Two other Republicans already announced bids for 2018: Secretary of State Brian Kemp and state Sen. Hunter Hill of Smyrna. On the Democratic side, House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is widely expected to make a run. Others still considering a campaign include State Rep. Stacey Evans of Smyrna and Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson. Cagle told the AP that meeting the jobs commitment will be his central focus if elected, and that he can meet the target by focusing on a combination of existing business expansions, new companies wooed away from other states and startup incubator programs at regional universities. “I’m confident that we can do it,” Cagle said. “I’m going to be a governor who’s going to work day and night to create the environment, but also make the ask and be the state’s No. 1 champion for meeting with companies and requesting them to locate here in Georgia.” It’s a high bar. State Department of Labor data shows Georgia has added a net total of 267,100 jobs in the last decade, accounting for the enormous job losses that followed the recession that began in 2008. In the last six years, employers added nearly 518,000 jobs to help the state dig out from a deep hole. Cagle said he also wants to overhaul the state’s method of planning maintenance on roads and other infrastructure, increase Georgia’s high school graduation rate and lower taxes on individuals and small businesses by adjusting income tax exemptions and deductions. The themes echo Cagle’s priorities while serving in the state Senate prior to becoming lieutenant governor in 2006. He has long backed expansion of charter schools, including a network of specialized charters called College and Career Academies that pair high school students with industries. As governor, Cagle said he’d ensure every high school student “has access” to one of those schools and expand programs like the industrial mechanics apprenticeship in Coweta County that rolled out in 2016. Cagle said each strategy is part of a “war on dropouts.” The most recent national study, based on 2013 figures, found 8.7 percent of Georgians between 16 and 24 lacked a high school degree, higher than the national average of 6.8 percent. “We have many different tools to meet students where they are, to put them on a path of greater prosperity,” Cagle said. “This is how we build a workforce in Georgia that becomes second to none.” The field is expected to grow increasingly crowded this spring as candidates in both major parties jostle for key fundraisers and other support ahead of primaries next spring. “Races in our state have become very costly and this is the time you have to start raising the dollars,” said Eric Tanenblatt, who was former Gov. Sonny Perdue’s chief of staff. He hasn’t committed to a candidate in the 2018 governor’s race. Another question remains as unsettled as the field: What role will President Donald Trump play in midterm elections across the country in 2018, including in Georgia’s gubernatorial race? “Any Republican would be lying to you if they told you they didn’t have a little concern about the energy on the Democrats’ side against this administration,” said Chip Lake, a Republican consultant who doesn’t plan to work on the governor’s race. Georgia is in the midst of an early test of Trump’s influence. In suburban Atlanta, Democrat Jon Ossoff raised at least $8 million for a special election in the conservative 6th Congressional District and narrowly missed the majority needed for a first-round win against a wide field of GOP candidates in the April primary. Republican Karen Handel has heartily embraced Trump as she prepares for the June runoff. Cagle believes Trump’s base, particularly in Georgia’s rural areas, won’t penalize him for his political experience. Their vote was against “insider” influence on politics, he said. Republican hopefuls also must walk a political tightrope on “religious liberty” proposals, a top priority for conservative groups that remain a vocal part of the GOP base. Cagle supported a bill creating legal protections for people acting on religious faith in 2016. More than 500 companies joined a coalition led by Coca-Cola and other big-name Georgia firms opposing the measure, and Deal vetoed it, saying Georgia doesn’t have to “discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community.” Cagle said he “will not stand for discrimination in any form” if elected governor, including acts against “individuals of faith.” “I believe that our current law and our current constitution - both state and federal - does protect our religious liberties,” he said.  “But if there is a problem, then I will be a governor that will seek to find a solution to that.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Investments in Russia become focus in congressional race
.B
HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Financial disclosure statements filed by a Montana Republican in his bid for Congress show $240,000 in investments in index funds with substantial holdings in Russian firms under sanctions by the U.S. government. The sanctions were put in place by the Obama administration three years ago because of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The revelations gave Democrat Rob Quist fresh ammunition to lob against Greg Gianforte ahead of a debate Saturday night that could be their only televised faceoff before the May 25 special congressional election. Libertarian Mark Wicks will also take part in the debate. With just 26 days left until the special election, the candidates have little time left to gain traction with voters. It remains to be seen whether news of Gianforte’s investment ties to Russia will gain traction in a campaign that has garnered national attention. “I think before we pass any judgment, we need additional context,” said David Parker, a professor of political science at Montana State University. “It might not sound too good, but I’m not really not sure if this is a large deal.” It’s not uncommon for investors dipping into global markets to have Russian companies in their portfolios, Gianforte’s campaign says. The investments are just a small part of Gianforte’s assets, which range between $96.2 million and $327.6 million, according to disclosures he is required to file with the U.S. House of Representatives. “He’s already promised Montanans that he will place his investments in a blind trust to guarantee there is never a conflict of interest,” said Brock Lowrance, Gianforte’s campaign manager. “When someone is investing in global markets, it’s not unusual to see investments like this.” National Republican groups are spending heavily in the race to keep the post in Republican hands. National Democrats have also begun investing money in the race, but the party’s priority appears to be in backing another candidate in a June special election in Georgia. The Quist campaign has latched onto the revelations first reported by the Guardian, a British newspaper, on Friday. “Montanans have a right to know why Greg Gianforte held onto these questionable Russian investments and why he kept his Russian ties secret during his failed run for governor last year,” Quist spokeswoman Tina Olechowski said. Gianforte campaign said officials said they expect the investments to come up in Saturday’s debate and were preparing to respond. The campaign has acknowledged about $150,000 in investments with VanEck Vectors Russian and about $92,000 with IShares MSCF Russia. Both companies deal in exchange-traded funds, which are similar to mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges. Even before Saturday’s debate began, there were questions over whether Quist would be allowed to wear his cowboy hat during the debate. It’s no small detail for a candidate who is trying to charm voters with his folksy, everyman persona to contrast with Gianforte’s more aggressive and all-business demeanor. The debate is expected to be the only televised encounter between the candidates, although Gianforte and Quist have previously squared off during meetings with the editorial boards of two Lee Newspapers, in Billings on Tuesday and in Helena on Friday. Saturday’ televised face-off will give both men a chance to reach a wider audience of voters. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A roadway analysis shows five bridge crossing are among the most congested Albuquerque roads. The Albuquerque Journal reports (http://bit.ly/2qgAXOA ) the latest Corridor Rankings from the Mid-Region Metropolitan Planning Organization put five crossing from U.S. 550 in Sandoval County to Bridge Boulevard in Albuquerque on top. The rankings are based on data from 2014. Transportation Planner Willie Simon says the analysis shows that there is a lot of demand to cross the Rio Grande eastbound in the mornings and westbound in the evenings. Senior Planner Nathan Masek does not think more river crossings with ease the traffic. Simons says improved traffic signal timing, better mass transportation options and road conditions phone apps may relieve some of the congestion. ___ Information from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Defense attorney Therese Cannata tells The Associated Press on Saturday Hunter also suffers from infections and could die in prison.

.B
Al Sharpton asked White House aide Omarosa Manigault on Thursday to deliver a message to President Trump on behalf of blacks and women concerned with the “disaster” he created during his first three months in office. Ms. Manigault spoke at the National Action Network summit organized by Mr. Sharpton in New York City this week when the civil rights leader asked her to relay a message to the president. “You are in a very precarious position, because you represent an administration that many of us disagree with,” Mr. Sharpton said to the White House aide and former reality show contestant, Politico reported. “But I would not be loyal to what I am if I did not address those issues and ask you to go back and tell them, ‘Yes, they were respectful. … No, they would not allow me to be silenced, but they told me to tell you that we as blacks and women are, in the first 100 days, seeing a disaster in Washington, D.C.,’ ” he added. Mr. Sharpton raised his concerns during Thursday’s event after Ms. Manigault generated groans from the audience while giving her closing marks, according to multiplereports. “I am looking forward to continue to partner with you, continuing to work on behalf of the National Action Network of Los Angeles, but, more importantly, the president of the United States,” Ms. Manigault told an reportedly unenthused audience. “We’ve had Bill O’Reilly here, we’ve had Sean Hannity here. We respect you. But I wish the President would respect us,” Mr. Sharpton said on stage afterwards, according to Politico. Ms. Manigault, 43, gained fame over a decade ago as a contestant on “The Apprentice,” Mr. Trump’s NBC reality show. She previously worked in the office of Vice President Al Gore in the 1990s and was a member of the Democratic Party before switching to Republican in 2015. She’s currently an aide to the president as well as the communications director for the White House Office of Public Liaison. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Heavy snow forces postponement of People’s Climate March rally in Colorado
.B
At least one of the People’s Climate March rallies scheduled for Saturday in Colorado was cancelled as a result of a major snowstorm, providing climate skeptics with a good chuckle. The Colorado Springs march, one of 12 slated to take place in Colorado, was canceled late Friday after heavy snow began falling across the Front Range, with more than a foot accumulating in some areas, as reported by Western Wire. “Sometimes Mother Nature throws you a curveball!” said the Colorado Springs Council for Justice in a Friday post 350 Colorado Springs. “We know we aren’t in the business of risking anyone’s safety. Dangerous conditions and wet heavy snow in the forecast for tomorrow.” More than 100 marchers braved the cold at a rally Saturday at Civic Center Park in Denver, where the snow was so heavy that someone was able to build a snowman, as shown in photos posted online. The website Complete Colorado ran a photo of a man on skis with the headline, “Heading to the Global Warming Rally Today.” The National Weather Service forecast six to 12 inches of snow, but the Denver metro area could see up to two feet. In Washington, D.C., the weather was more in line with the marchers’ global-warming message, with temperatures expected to hit 91 degrees. The People’s Climate March, sponsored by labor unions, environmental organizations and social-justice groups, is aimed at protesting the Trump administration on a host of topics, including climate change, social justice and the so-called “travel ban.” The Washington, D.C., event, which comes a week after the similarly climate-themed March for Science, featured a number of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Maria Cantwell of Washington. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who’s locked in a legal battle with ExxonMobil, also spoke to the crowd. “Let’s get out there, let’s raise our voices, let’s make sure no one is standing above the law and we are all standing up for our planet and humankind,” said Ms. Healey on Twitter.

Pence christens new attack submarine, urges Congress to boost defense spending
.B
Vice President Mike Pence marked the Trump administration’s 100th day Saturday by christening a new Virginia-class fast attack submarine and calling on Congress to meet President Trump’s request for an extra $30 billion for defense in a short-term spending bill. Mr. Pence christened the U.S.S. Indiana in a ceremony at the Huntington Ingalls Shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, with an audience of lawmakers, shipyard workers and Navy personnel. “Just next week, with President Trump’s leadership, and the strong support of the members of Congress gathered here today, Congress will pass a spending bill with long-overdue investments in our military readiness even before this fiscal year ends,” Mr. Pence said. “That’s what leadership looks like.” Mr. Trump is requesting the $30-billion increase for defense in the spending bill being negotiated in Congress to complete the current fiscal year. Negotiators are expected to finish work on that measure next week, amid reports that lawmakers are considering a $15-billion increase for the Pentagon. The administration also has proposed boosting defense spending by about 10 percent in fiscal 2018, calling it the largest military buildup since the Reagan administration. The vice president said the military buildup is one of Mr. Trump’s main priorities. “In just his first 100 days in office, President Trump has already taken decisive action to end an era of budget cuts to America’s military and to America’s security,” Mr. Pence said. “At a time of mounting threats across the globe, President Trump has made it clear America’s national security is this president’s highest priority now and always.” Mr. Pence said the administration “will make the strongest fighting force in the world stronger still. “As history attests, when America is strong, the world is safe.  And the U.S.S. Indiana will bear witness to this truth,” he said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

EXCLUSIVE: Trump demands South Korea pay for new U.S.-deployed missile system 
.B
President Trump pushed back Friday against South Korea’s objections to paying for a U.S.-deployed missile defense system, insisting that it’s “appropriate” for Seoul to shoulder the $1 billion cost. “Why should we pay for it?” Mr. Trump said in an exclusive interview with The Washington Times. “It’s a phenomenal protective system, best in the world by far, and that’s meant to protect South Korea. So I respectfully say that I think it would be appropriate if they paid for it.” The U.S. military is deploying the missile shield as a defense against North Korea. The South Korean defense ministry said it has no plans to pay for the system, and South Korea’s leading presidential candidate Friday called Mr. Trump’s demand an “impossible option.” In a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office as he approaches his 100th day in office on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he feels the “tremendous weight” of the presidency in grappling with national-security challenges such as “the potential of seriously having to counteract North Korea.” The White House held a closed-door briefing this week for senators on the “grave” threat posed by North Korea. Mr. Trump said he’s still hopeful that his warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping will bring force Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic pressure to abandon its ballistic missile and nuclear-weapons programs, without the need for U.S. military action. “Tremendous pressure’s being put on,” Mr. Trump said. “Now, I don’t know that China has the kind of control [over North Korea] that some people think. And some people think they have very little control. You know, they’ve had many wars with Korea. This isn’t easy for China. But he [Mr. Xi] is a great guy, he’s a highly respected person, somebody I really, really like, and I believe he’s trying.” Mr. Trump is also calling for a renegotiation of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus, which will enter a review period next week allowing for a renegotiated pact or possible withdrawal. The current version took effect in March 2012 under the Obama administration. “It’s been a very bad deal for the United States, negotiated by [former Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Trump said.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah’s Planned Parenthood may be safe from defunding thanks to a recent court agreement. Court documents filed on Friday state that Utah has agreed not to attempt to defund the organization or deny it funding “on impermissible constitutional grounds.” The agreement does not require that the Utah governor and Department of Health continue contracts, renew contracts or issue new contract to the organization. It only says if the state choses to defund, end or deny contracts, it needs to provide the organization with a legitimate reason within 30 days. The court documents also state that “unproven allegations” such as illegal fetal tissue sale rumors are not a legitimate basis for such actions. U.S. District Judge Dee Benson needs to sign the injunction to make it permanent. ___ Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

‘Black bloc’ protester pleads guilty to felonies from Inauguration Day rioting
.B
A Florida man with the radical “black bloc” protest network pleaded guilty Friday to felony rioting and assault for his role in the Inauguration Day chaos in Washington, D.C. Dane Powell, 31, of Tampa was the first to enter a guilty plea on felony charges brought against 212 protesters accused of rioting and vandalizing property during the Jan. 20 melee surrounding President Trump’s swearing-in ceremony. Scheduled to be sentenced July 7, he faces a possible six years in prison for breaking windows and throwing a “brick, large rock or piece of concrete” at officers after joining a mob of masked black bloc protesters who moved en masse across 16 blocks in about 30 minutes, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The plea was announced by U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Channing D. Phillips and Peter Newsham, Metropolitan Police Department acting chief. Carrying hammers, crowbars, metal poles and wooden sticks, the self-described anarchists broke windows at a dozen businesses, including Starbucks, McDonald’s and Bank of America; pulled newspaper stands and trash cans into the streets; spray-painted buildings, and shattered the windows of a police cruiser and limousine. Federal prosecutors released a superseding indictment Thursday that brought additional felony counts against some defendants, including Powell, which brought an outcry from protesters. “The prosecutor is using the threat of years in prison to obtain convictions before she has even bothered to make a case against anyone,” said Olivia Alsip, who said she was offered but rejected a plea deal, in a statement. “Many defendants, like myself, believe these cases to be politically motivated and want to take these ridiculous charges to trial.”’ The 212 defendants face eight felony charges: one count of inciting or urging to riot; one count of engaging in rioting; one count of conspiracy to riot, and five counts of destruction of property, said U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman Bill Miller. In addition, 100 defendants have been charged with another count of misdemeanor assault on a police officer. One was charged with assaulting an officer in a separate incident; two were charged with vandalizing a limousine, and one was charged with three felony counts of assault on a police officer while armed. Defend J20 Resistance, a committee supporting the defendants, countered with a Friday statement insisting that protesters were “violently attacked on Jan. 20 by police using chemical and projectile weapons.” Disrupt J20 was involved in organizing the inaugural protests, but Defend J20 spokesman Matthew Whitley said the groups are not connected. “We haven’t seen a shred of new evidence to support this superseding indictment,” said Sarah Hailey, a defendant arrested in the Jan. 20 protest. “The prosecutor is just using excessive charges in order to scare and coerce us into pleading guilty.” Defend J20 said that more than 100 of those charged have joined an agreement, Points of Unity, in which they vow not to cooperate with prosecutors at the expense of other defendants. In a press release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said Powell and others threw bricks, rocks and concrete pieces at officers, knocking one unconscious and sending others to the hospital. “Under the District of Columbia’s voluntary sentencing guidelines, Powell faces an estimated range of 12 to 36 months in prison on each of the two charges,” said the release. A total of 230 people were arrested on Inauguration Day, but prosecutors later dismissed cases against 19 of them. Another two protesters pleaded guilty to misdemeanor rioting. The black bloc has been described as a “anarchist tactic” used by violent, anonymous protesters to blend together and conceal their identities. Black bloc mobs were accused of inciting the Feb. 2 rioting over conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos in Berkeley, California. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Senate confirms Acosta, last member of Trump’s Cabinet, at 100th day in office nears
.B
The Senate on Thursday confirmed Alex Acosta as secretary of labor, filling out President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as he approaches his 100th day in office. The 60-38 vote confirms Acosta to the post. Once sworn as the nation’s 27th secretary of labor, the son of Cuban immigrants will lead an a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. Acosta has been a federal prosecutor, a civil rights chief at the Justice Department and a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He will arrive at the top post with relatively little clear record on some of the top issues facing the administration over key pocketbook issues, such as whether to expand the pool of American workers eligible for overtime pay. Acosta wasn’t Trump’s first choice for the job. Former fast food CEO Andrew Puzder withdrew his name from consideration last month, on the eve of his confirmation vote, after becoming a political headache for the new administration. Puzder acknowledged having hired a housekeeper not authorized to work in the U.S. and paying the related taxes years later — after Trump nominated him — and came under fire from Democrats for other issues related to his company and his private life. Acosta’s ascension would come at a key moment for Trump, just two days before he reaches the symbolic, 100-day mile marker. The White House has sought to cross the threshold with its own list of Trump’s accomplishments. Labor secretary is the last Cabinet post for Trump to fill. Trump’s choice for U.S. trade representative, a job considered Cabinet-level, is awaiting a Senate vote. From the beginning, Acosta’s was a quiet march to confirmation that stood out because it didn’t attract the deep partisan battles faced by some of Trump’s other nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination provoked such a fight that majority Senate Republicans used the “nuclear option” to remove the 60-vote filibuster barrier for Supreme Court picks. Thursday’s vote marks the fourth time Acosta has been confirmed for the Senate. Democrats and most labor groups were mostly muted in their response to Acosta’s nomination. At his confirmation hearing, Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington State and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hammered Acosta for answers on a selection of issues important to labor and whether Acosta would cave to political pressure from Trump. Acosta refused to answer the policy questions until he’s confirmed, and he vowed to be an independent and fair voice for workers. Both senators said they had great concerns, and both were expected to vote no. Our standard can’t be ‘not Puzder,’ ” Murray said Wednesday on the Senate floor. But tellingly, even as Acosta’s nomination wound through the Senate, Democrats and their allies also tried to move on to other, labor-related issues — namely, a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour, which Trump opposes. Meanwhile, the Labor Department’s landing page bears a glimpse of Acosta’s policy priorities: “Buy American, Hire American.” That’s the title of Trump’s executive order this week directing the secretaries of labor and other agencies to issue guidance within 60 days on policies that would “ensure that, to the extent permitted by law” federal aid “maximize the use of materials produced in the United States, including manufactured products; components of manufactured products; and materials such as steel, iron, aluminum, and cement.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Brune: No estimates on how bad Social Security fraud is
.B
Social Security can’t even give a ballpark estimate for how much fraud there is in the program, a top official admitted to Congress on Wednesday — though he insisted they care about the matter and are working to weed out bogus payments, particularly in disability payments. Sean Brune, assistant deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration’s budget office, said they’re trying to become more aware of the problems and looking for new tools to fight back, but said he couldn’t guess at how bad the problem is. “I do not have a dollar amount of the general amount of fraud,” Mr. Brune told the House Ways and Means Committee. The $150 billion-a-year disability program has been touched by several massive fraud rings in recent years, including one based in West Virginia and Kentucky that investigators say filed more than 1,700 fraudulent applications, which could cost the government more than $500 million in bogus lifetime benefits. The government’s comptroller general said Social Security needs to pay more attention to the problem, and needs to figure out where it’s running the biggest risks of fraud. Mr. Brune said the agency is trying to get there, looking to calculate and manage risks. “We have some metrics, we just need to improve them,” he said. Mr. Brune admitted that his agency doesn’t have the power to strip fraudster employees of their pensions — meaning a former Social Security administrative law judge who stands accused of being part of the Kentucky and West Virginia fraud ring will collect a government pension. “We do not have under current statute authority to revoke his pension,” he said. Still, he said that the former judge is convicted the court can order restitution, meaning his pension could be garnished to cover those costs. Rep. Tom Rice, a South Carolina Republican who said the former judge is now living in his district, asked if Congress should pass a law to cancel pensions of Social Security employees who abet fraud. “We’d be happy to talk to you about that,” Mr. Brune said. Social Security has started a program where it has loaned lawyers out to federal prosecutors’ offices to encourage them to pursue fraud cases. In the first six months of fiscal year 2017 that program has won 119 guilty pleas from fraudsters, winning pledges of more than $10 million in restitution. Democrats said that while fraud was a problem, the agency needed to make sure it wasn’t canceling benefits of those who legitimately qualified. They also warned against further budget and staffing cuts at the agency, saying the workload is increasing with the retirement of baby boomers. Nearly 10 million people collect disability benefits, and the average payment is about $1,170 a month, according to the latest statistics. The enrollment number has soared over the last two decades, more than doubling during that time. That’s far faster than the growth rate in the population, leaving some analysts to suspect fraud or other dubious reasons. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump to create new office on VA accountability, whistleblower protection
.B
President Trump is expected to issue an executive order Thursday creating an office within the Department of Veterans Affairs to take charge of disciplining or firing incompetent employees and protecting whistleblowers. Mr. Trump will visit the VA headquarters near the White House to create the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which will be aimed at helping VA Secretary David J. Shulkin to discipline or terminate VA managers or employees who fail to carry out their duties, a White House official confirmed. The embattled agency was criticized repeatedly during the Obama administration for failing to discipline employees engaged in wrongdoing. Whistleblowers in the VA also have faced retaliation in what they say is a pattern to silence critics of the agency’s operations. Concerned Veterans for America applauded the announcement, but the group said the effort needs to be backed up with legislation that will help the new office carry out its goals. “President Trump put veterans at the top of his priority list in his first 100 days, and we’re confident he will continue to do everything in his power to take care of them,” said CVA Executive Director Mark Lucas. “This new executive order should be a wake-up call to Congress that the VA is continuing to fail because of employee negligence and misconduct.” The House has passed the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, which would give the agency more authority to discipline employees. But a similar measure faces opposition, mainly from Democrats in the Senate. Mr. Lucas said Mr. Shulkin’s “hands will be tied until Congress passes strong accountability legislation, like the VA Accountability First Act, to let him get these bad VA employees out quickly. The ball is in the Senate’s court.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Seoul: North Korea test-fires missile from western region
.B
SEOUL — North Korea test-fired a mid-range ballistic missile from the western part of its country Saturday, but the launch apparently failed, South Korea and the United States said Saturday. The test will be condemned by outsiders as yet another step in the North’s push for a nuclear-tipped missile that can strike the U.S. mainland. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the North fired the unidentified missile from around Pukchang, which is near the capital Pyongyang, but provided no other details. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the missile was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. It broke up a couple minutes after the launch and the pieces fell into the Sea of Japan. A South Korean military official also said without elaborating that the launch was believed to be a failure. He didn’t want to be named, citing office rules. The official couldn’t immediately confirm how far the missile flew or whether it had exploded shortly after launch. North Korea routinely test-fires a variety of ballistic missiles, despite United Nations prohibitions, as part of its weapons development. While shorter-range missiles are somewhat routine, there is strong outside worry about each longer-range North Korean ballistic test. Saturday’s launch comes at a point of particularly high tension. U.S. President Donald Trump took an initial hard line with Pyongyang and sent a U.S. aircraft supercarrier to Korean waters. His diplomats are now taking a softer tone. On Friday, the United States and China offered starkly different strategies for addressing North Korea’s escalating nuclear threat as Trump’s top diplomat demanded full enforcement of economic sanctions on Pyongyang and urged new penalties. Stepping back from suggestions of U. S. military action, he even offered aid to North Korea if it ends its nuclear weapons program. The range of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s suggestions, which over a span of 24 hours also included restarting negotiations, reflected America’s failure to halt North Korea’s nuclear advances despite decades of U.S.-led sanctions, military threats and stop-and-go rounds of diplomatic engagement. As the North approaches the capability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, the Trump administration feels it is running out of time. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Pope Francis warns of broad destruction if Korean tensions escalate
.B
ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis is warning that “a good part of humanity” will be destroyed if tensions with North Korea escalate, and he is calling for diplomacy and a revived United Nations to take the lead in negotiating a resolution. Francis was asked as he traveled back to Rome from Egypt on Saturday about North Korean ballistic missile tests and U.S. warnings of “catastrophic” consequences if the world fails to stop them. He was asked specifically what he would tell U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sent a U.S. carrier to conduct drills near the Koreas, and other leaders to try to diffuse the tensions. Francis says he would urge them to use diplomacy and negotiation “because it’s the future of humanity.” “Today, a wider war will destroy not a small part of humanity, but a good part of humanity and culture. Everything. Everything, no? It would be terrible. I don’t think humanity today could bear it,” he told reporters. His comments came at a moment of particularly high tension: Hours earlier, a North Korean mid-range ballistic missile apparently failed, the third flop in a month. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang’s escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. North Korean ballistic missile tests are banned by the United Nations because they’re seen as part of the North’s push for a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland. Francis said the U.N. should regain its leadership in conflict resolution, saying it had been “watered down” over time. Trump has sent a nuclear-powered submarine and the USS Carl Vinson aircraft supercarrier to Korean waters, and North Korea this week conducted large-scale, live-fire exercises on its eastern coast. The U.S. and South Korea also started installing a missile defense system that is supposed to be partially operational within days, and their navies began joint military drills on Saturday. Tensions with the North presumably would be on the agenda of a Trump-Francis meeting. The White House has said it would reach out to the Vatican to arrange an audience when Trump travels to Sicily at the end of May for a G7 summit. Francis said no official request for a meeting with Trump had been received “but I welcome every head of state who requests an audience.” Francis recalled he has frequently lamented the “world war in pieces” that is raging in countries around the world. Now, he says, those pieces are getting bigger and more concentrated. “This thing about North Korea missiles, it has been a long time that they’ve been doing this. Now it seems it has gotten too hot,” he told reporters on the papal plane. “I always call for problems to be resolved via the diplomatic path, via negotiations.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Maryland police offer $5,000 reward for David Watson, escaped convict
.B
Police announced a $5,000 reward Saturday for information leading to the arrest of David M. Watson II, a convicted would-be cop killer who escaped custody Friday morning in central Maryland. “Investigators have received no confirmed sightings of escaped prisoner David Watson. Anyone with information is urged to call 911. Police are offering a reward up to $5,000,” the Howard County Police Department said in a Saturday afternoon Facebook post. Authorities described Watson as a white male weighing about 140 pounds and 5 feet, 8 inches tall. The word “evil” is tattooed on the back of his neck and his last name is inked on one of his arms, among other distinguishing markings seen in images released by authorities. He was in the midst of serving over 100 years in prison for the attempted murder of police officers at the time of the escape. Watson, 28, escaped Friday morning after being transported to a state hospital in Jessup for a psychiatric evaluation when he escaped at around 9:40 a.m. “A guard opened the door after the van stopped in the parking lot and Watson, who was the only occupant, pushed the guard to the ground and ran into the woods,” Howard County police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn said afterwards. “He escaped before they ever made it into the hospital or ever made contact with the hospital from the parking lot area.” “We just want everyone to be aware and on the lookout,” she told The Washington Post.

Police search for David Watson, escaped convict, in woods near Maryland prison: Reports

Police in Maryland are searching for a convict who escaped from the custody of correctional officers in Howard County Friday morning. David M. Watson II was arriving from Wicomico County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore at a state hospital facility in Howard County when he escaped from corrections officers and ran into nearby woods, the Baltimore Sun reported. According to officials, both helicopter and K-9 units are assisting in the search for the 28-year-old man, who is not believed to be armed. In a news conference held this afternoon, Howard County police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn said it was unclear if Watson had planned the escape or if it was an impulsive decision. Ms. Llewellyn also added that it was unclear if he had any contacts in the area where he escaped. Watson is serving a 106-year sentence in Delaware stemming from an attempted murder conviction, but had been remanded to the custody of Wicomico County officials in a case involving the attempted murder of police officers there. In 2015, a judge declared Watson incompetent to stand trial for the attempted murder of Wicomico police officers. Watson’s transport Friday morning to the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup was in order to obtain a regular follow-up psychiatric evaluation, the Annapolis Capital reported. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

The people’s billionaire: George Soros gave $36M to groups behind People’s Climate March
.B
The People’s Climate March scheduled for Saturday has a powerful billionaire behind it: Democratic Party donor George Soros. Mr. Soros, who heads the Open Society Foundations, contributed over $36 million between 2000 and 2014 to 18 of the 55 organizations on the march’s steering committee, according to an analysis released Friday by the conservative Media Research Center. Six of the groups received during that time more than $1 million each: the Center for Community Change, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, People’s Action, Public Citizen and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The People’s Climate March, which comes a week after another climate-themed anti-Trump event, the March for Science, is scheduled to run along Pennsylvania Avenue and end by surrounding the White House in order to “drown out all of the climate-denying nonsense that has been coming out of this Administration.” While some of its partners are climate-change organizations like NextGen Climate, founded by top Democratic donor Tom Steyer, the march is also heavily backed by labor unions and social-justice groups such as Color of Change, which is also backed by Mr. Soros. Only three of the six organizations on the steering committee — NRDC, Public Citizen and UCS — “actually have anything climate-related in their individual missions,” the MRC reported. “The presence of many non-climate related organizations leading the march indicated that this climate march (just like the March for Science and the Women’s March) is not about a single issue, but about attacking the new administration,” MRC’s Aly Nielsen said. She pointed to the march’s “usual checklist of liberal policy priorities,” such as labor-union rights, a minimum-wage increase, and a halt to “attacks on immigrants.” People’s Climate March organizers have made no secret of their antipathy for President Trump, calling for “climate, jobs and justice” as an alternative to “Trump’s disastrous agenda.” “Trump’s game plan has been to relentlessly attack our communities and shock us into despair,” said the march in a post. “It hasn’t worked because our people-powered movement is stronger than he is — together, the resistance stopped his attempts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and stymied his despicable Muslim ban.” Mr. Soros, a longtime top donor to Democrats and left-wing causes, contributed nearly $10 million to Priorities USA Action, the primary super PAC supporting Mr. Trump’s opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election cycle, according to Open Secrets. The march is scheduled for the 100th day of the Trump administration. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

The last CIA agent in Saigon bitterly marks its chaotic end
.B
BANGKOK — Time has done little to dull the anger of James Parker, the last CIA officer to evacuate Vietnam, as the world this weekend marks the anniversary of the U.S. evacuation of the Saigon embassy just ahead of advancing North Vietnamese forces in 1975. When South Vietnam’s capital fell, the intelligence officer’s two best military sources committed suicide and the actions of an American diplomat endangered the lives of escaping diplomats and CIA personnel, the 73-year-old Mr. Parker recalled in an interview. Off the coast of Danang, panicked South Vietnamese who evacuated onto a U.S. ship shot, stabbed, raped, trampled and executed each other during onboard revenge attacks. But much of his anger targets Mr. Parker’s fellow Americans, as they stumbled through one of the low points of the postwar era in American history. “As for my experiences back in Vietnam at the end, [I remember] the absolute chickens—t character of the men in the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, how they were so petty and self-indulgent, so pedantic and so distant from the fighting,” Mr. Parker said in an interview with the Washington Times, an attitude that he says contributed to the ignominious defeat. “Their pusillanimity disrespected the men, American and Asian, I had known who died fighting the good fight,” he said. “… The State Department people were not folks to look up to in a combat zone.” Mr. Parker now lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a 32-year career in the CIA starting in 1970. He has written several books about his experiences in Southeast Asia, including his newest volume published in 2016 titled, “The Vietnam War: Its Ownself.” The colorful, 706-page book includes photographs of CIA officers, Hmong and Vietnamese soldiers, maps of bomb sites, and pictures of dead bodies and one nude Lao bar girl. His memories of the bitter end remain especially vivid. One week before the communist North defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government, the “evacuation plan for the consulate” in Can Tho city where Mr. Parker was based degenerated into chaos. “Jim D., a career Central Intelligence Operations officer and chief of the CIA base in the Delta of South Vietnam” insisted the safest, most reliable evacuation would be in helicopters, Mr. Parker said in the interview, declining to reveal Jim D.’s full name. But Consul-General Terry McNamara did not trust the CIA’s battle-hardened Air America pilots would fly them to a waiting U.S. Navy ship. Mr. McNamara yelled: “”They could leave us all here. They are wild, uncontrollable animals, the Air America people. We control our own destiny if we go out by boat” on a 60-mile Bassac River route to the South China Sea. Jim D. replied: “I have my people to protect, and I have [Air America] helicopters. My people go out by helicopter.” Mr. Parker’s and his CIA colleagues’ escape was also at risk. “Mr. McNamara’s plan did not provide for the safety of the CIA officers,” he wrote. “We had no cover. If we were captured by the North Vietnamese, as was entirely possible, McNamara suggested we tell them that we were USAID engineers, which would not have held up during any type of serious interrogation.” Mr. McNamara, his diplomatic staff and some South Vietnamese nationals went on boats down the “extremely dangerous” river, Mr. Parker said in the interview.  “He must have known his plan would leave CIA agents behind.  And I don’t think he cared.” The State Department eventually overruled Mr. McNamara and cleared an evacuation by air. This allowed Mr. Parker, Jim D. and others to arrange Air America helicopter flights to U.S. Navy ships for themselves, the consulate, embassy and CIA, plus more than 100 CIA key local allies during the final 48 hours. Losing sources One week before the war’s end, Mr. Parker’s best South Vietnamese source, Gen. Tran Van Hai, predicted the April 30 deadline of North Vietnam’s victory. But Saigon’s CIA Station Chief Tom Polgar and CIA head analyst Frank Snepp refused to believe Mr. Parker. They insisted North Vietnam would allow Saigon and the southern Delta to remain under U.S. protection after a cease-fire, he said. On May 1, 1975, Gen. Hai was found dead. “General Hai lay face down at his desk. Alone during the night, without saying good-bye to anyone, he had committed suicide. A half-empty glass of brandy, laced with poison, was near an outstretched hand,” Mr. Parker wrote. “That report Hai gave me [predicting] the day Saigon would fall to the NVA” probably helped Mr. Parker win a top citation from his Langley bosses, the agent bitterly recalled in the interview. Hours after Hanoi’s victory, South Vietnamese Gen. Le Van Hung — Mr. Parker’s other top intelligence source — saluted his troops “and then shook each man’s hand. He asked everyone to leave. Some of his men did not move, so he pushed them out the door, shook off his wife’s final pleas, and finally was alone in his office. “Within moments there was a loud shot. General Hung was dead,” he wrote. There were other bitter memories in those final days. One month before the final defeat, Merchant Marine Capt. Ed Flink aboard the Pioneer Contender — a U.S. ship chartered to the Military Sealift Command — was evacuating Americans and thousands of South Vietnamese civilians from Danang when it fell to the communists. As the mission proceeded, however, some U.S.-backed South Vietnamese Rangers also climbed aboard. “The Vietnamese Rangers … took over my ship. Killed, raped, robbed. You could hear gunshots all the time. Soldiers were walking around with bloody knives,” Capt. Flink told Mr. Parker. “We had to lock ourselves in the pilot house. I only had a crew of 40 plus some security, but there were thousands of those wild, crazy Vietnamese people.” “They finally shot some of the worst, once we docked, … but I’ll tell you, son, it was hell. We found bodies all over the ship after everyone got off. Babies, old women, young boys. Cut, shot and trampled to death.” Mr. Parker said in the interview: “It was Vietnamese officials who shot the rioters.” Capt. Flink later told interviewers Vietnamese conducted onboard “kangaroo courts” and executed suspected communists. Mr. Parker was the last CIA officer to evacuate Vietnam, escaping on May 1, 1975, two days after the U.S. abandoned the Saigon embassy. He joined the CIA in 1971 as a paramilitary case officer fighting alongside ethnic Hmong guerrillas and Thailand’s forces against Lao and North Vietnamese communists inside Laos until 1973. In 1974, he became a CIA intelligence officer in South Vietnam handling Vietnamese agents and South Vietnam’s military. He retired in 1992 but on Sept. 11, 2001, returned to the CIA as a contractor to “teach tradecraft to new hires” and work inside Cambodia, Afghanistan and elsewhere before retiring again in 2011.

Putin opponent doused with chemicals outside Moscow office
.B
Russian opposition leader and activist Alexei Navalny was briefly hospitalized Thursday after being doused with chemicals for the second time in as many months. Mr. Navalny, 40, was attacked by an unknown person while getting into a car outside his Moscow office, witnesses told regional media. The assailant doused the politician with a green antiseptic known in Russia as “zelyonka,” resulting in chemical burns to Mr. Navalny’s right eye, the independent television network Dozhd reported. “The ambulance came, looked at my dark-green eye, and said that they’re taking me to the hospital,” Mr. Navalny said on social media afterwards. They wrapped up [my head] like it’d been seriously injured. It looks pretty funny, but my eye hurts like hell.” Mr. Navalny was similarly assaulted with antiseptic last month in the Siberian city of Barnaul, and other vocal critics of Russian President Vladimit Putin have been subjected to identical treatment in the weeks since: Ilya Varmalov, an independent Russian journalist, was attacked with zelyonka, eggs and flour at the Stavropol airport Thursday. Meanwhile, Russian opposition political party Yabloko said a female activist, Natalia Fedorova, was “almost blinded” by a similar assault Friday. The latest wave of attacks has unfolded as the Kremlin continues to crackdown against protesters opposed to the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Mr. Navalny has been involved in orchestrating a series of recent rallies against the current government, and intends to campaign for Mr. Putin’s job in next year’s presidential election. The government has challenged his ability to run, however, and has cited a 2013 criminal conviction as grounds for exclusion. On Wednesday, meanwhile, the prosecutor’s office in Moscow formally blacklisted three group from the country, including “Open Russia,” a British-based organization that had encouraged individuals to protest the Putin regime. Those groups, according to Moscow, have “threatened the basic principles of the constitutional order of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Yik Yak messaging app readies shutdown after million dollar buy-out
.B
Yik Yak, a controversial messaging application favored by college students, will soon go kaput, its co-founders announced Friday. “The time has come… for our paths to part ways, as we’ve decided to make our next moves as a company,” co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington wrote in a blog post. “To that end, we’ll begin winding down the Yik Yak app over the coming week as we start tinkering around with what’s ahead for our brand, our technology and ourselves,” they added. Launched in 2013, Yik Yak made a name for itself by letting users post messages with pseudo anonymity only visible within a certain radius. The service quickly gained popularity on college and high school campuses and was valued at close to $400 million the following year. Despite gaining over $73 million in venture funding, however, Yik Yak failed to outperform other messaging apps and eventually waned in popularity, prompting the company to lay off more than half its staff late last year. The app nonetheless managed to attract controversy throughout its four-year run, however, and was banned on multiple campuses for allegedly contributing to cyberbullying and the spreading of hate speech. In one instance, Colorado College in Colorado Springs booted two students from the school in 2015 after they shared messages deemed inappropriate by administrators. According to a filing made with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission last week, Yik Yak recently sold off its engineering team and some minor intellectual property to Square, a mobile payment company, for $1 million –  a sliver of the company’s former value.

Guinness finally vegan-friendly with the phaseout of isinglass complete: Report
.B
Ireland’s perhaps most iconic beer is now vegan-friendly, as Guinness reportedly has finished its phaseout of a material used in the brewing process that involved fish parts. Diageo, the company that manufactures the brand, said the new process for making the stout does not use isinglass, a product made from fish bladders that helps remove extra yeast, the Times of Londonreported Friday. Isinglass, which had been part of the brewing process for centuries, has historically been used not to affect the taste of the drink so much as to filter out yeast in the brewing process. The phaseout of isinglass was first announced by the company in November 2015, The New York Times reported at the time. “All brewers want to use the latest and the best technology, we’ve been researching for a decade about how we can reduce the amount lost in the filtration process so we were excited that this might work,” Guinness brewer Stephen Kilcullen said. The new system functions like a giant sieve which doesn’t let any yeast through, eliminating the need for isinglass, The Times of London reported. Though appealing to beer-loving vegans doesn’t appear to be the main reason Guinness ditched the use of isinglass, company officials nevertheless raise a glass to the idea that it expands the market, if only marginally, The Times reported. “It’s great though that it means people who haven’t have a pint in a while can have one now,” Mr. Kilcullen said.

Milo Yiannopoulos’ $12M comeback: Provocateur lands big investment for Milo Inc.
.B
Former Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos is readying a high-profile return thanks to a $12 million investment in his latest project: Milo Inc. Simon & Schuster backed out of a publishing deal with Mr. Yiannopoulos in February — and he was essentially forced to step down from Breitbart — due to controversial remarks about sexual abuse he experienced as a teenager, but the provocateur is primed for a comeback. In addition to a “Free Speech Week” event planned for later this year, the pundit showed Vanity Fair a contract for a big-budget venture. “The business, which will be called Milo Inc., will be even more focused  on stoking the sort of ugly political conflict that’s closer to the  surface than ever in these early months of the Trump administration,” Vanity Fair reported Friday. The magazine was shown a page of Mr. Yiannopoulos’ contract with his investors’ names censored, and writer Tina Nguyen also interviewed someone close to the project who requested anonymity. “Milo has the best instincts about these things,” the source said. Milo Inc. will be a Miami-based company with roughly 30 staff members. “The business of Madonna became touring,” Mr. Yiannopoulos told the magazine, citing the artist’s Live Nation contract. “I’m doing the  same thing, but instead of signing up with Live Nation, I’m building  one. I’m building it for libertarian and conservative comedians,  writers, stand-up comics, intellectuals, you name it.” The pundit is also organizing Free Speech Week at UC Berkeley, where a previous event was derailed by violent protesters. “My proposed Free Speech Week will proceed as planned later this year. I WILL BRING AN ARMY IF I HAVE TO,” he said Wednesday on Facebook. “We will ensure that Ann [Coulter] and others can speak and we will publicly, ritually humiliate UC Berkeley for its failure to meet its legal obligations until conservative speakers no longer fear violent mobs just for exercising their First Amendment rights. Berkeley is going to become the free speech capital of the United States once again. I will make sure of it.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Socked: Pro-lifers deliver 200,000 baby socks to Congress in plea to defund Planned Parenthood
.B
Brightly colored baby socks flooded the halls of the U.S. Capitol Wednesday, representing the hundreds of thousands of lives lost annually to Planned Parenthood, and sending the unmistakable message to Congress to defund the nation’s largest abortion provider. Spearheaded by Students for Life of America, the SockIt2PP campaign collected 196,543 baby socks and plans to deliver a total of 323,299 to match the number of abortions Planned Parenthood performed last year. “It’s a devastatingly large number,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, standing on a podium above a giant mound of baby socks outside of the Capitol. “And we need to have images like this so that people start to reflect on the magnitude of suffering that’s happening out there.” On Wednesday volunteers delivered 88,000 socks to members of Congress — the number of abortions Planned Parenthood has performed during the first 100 days of the new administration. The demonstration comes in the midst of policy negotiations that will decide the fate of Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million in taxpayer funding every year to keep its doors open. Before delivering the socks, pro-life activists, lawmakers and students held a rally on a Capitol Hill lawn. The baby socks were predominantly white, pink and blue. Others were patterned with soccer balls, polka dots and Batman logos. Sue Thayer, a former Planned Parenthood center manager who is now a pro-life activist, said the baby socks were like something out of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum down the street. “There should be little feet in all of these socks,” Ms. Thayer said. “There should be little babies in all of these socks.” The baby socks were sent in from students at hundreds of high school and college chapters of Students for Life and other pro-life organizations. Purity Thomas, president of the Roanoke Students for Life, said it’s unthinkable that “we allow our tax dollars to go to the funding of an organization that murders innocent children daily.” “This is an organization that kills our brothers and sisters,” Ms. Thomas said. “How, as a nation, have we allowed this?” Emily Brown, youth director at American Life League, said the baby socks send an unmistakable message. “Today we’re sending a clear message to Congress that enough is enough,” Ms. Brown said. “We cannot sit around while Planned Parenthood slaughters the most innocent human beings among us.” In order to avoid a Senate filibuster, Republicans have said they will defund Planned Parenthood simultaneously with the repeal of Obamacare through the reconciliation process. The repeal bill took a major step toward enactment Wednesday, when it received the endorsement of the House Freedom Caucus. The conservative stalwarts had blocked the American Health Care Act last month because it did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare. Samuel Matthews, president of Huntington High School Students for Life, said an organization that “calls taking the life of boys and girls in the womb ‘empowering’” does not deserve taxpayer funding. “We are here because we have a problem with Planned Parenthood,” Mr. Matthews said. “And one day soon, Planned Parenthood will be defunded.” Mr. Sasse said pictures showing the humanity of the unborn are a “huge reason why” the youngest generation is more pro-life than previous ones. “And this picture that you’re trying to create today is another special way to tell the story of what we’re about.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Scientists develop synthetic uterus to aid development of premature lambs
.B
Over 20 years since scientists first successfully cloned Dolly the sheep, lambs are again helping to push the envelope of human development. Scientists announced successful tests of an artificial womb continuing the development of premature lambs, in a study published this week in the journal Nature. The researchers are associated with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The premature lambs were “developmentally equivalent” to human babies born extremely premature, the report said. Placing the lambs in a bag to mimic the uterus, they not only survived for four weeks, but showed significant development. The premature lamb is connected to the mock uterus by a synthetic umbilical chord and suspended in a man-made amniotic fluid. It “closely reproduces the environment of the womb,” the scientists wrote. “We show that fetal lambs that are developmentally equivalent to the extreme premature human infant can be physiologically supported in this extra-uterine device for up to four weeks,” the researchers wrote in their abstract. Babies born before 37 weeks are considered premature, with the most serious complications occurring at preterm birth of 22-25 weeks. It is the most common cause of infant death and leading cause of long-term disability, according to the National Institutes of Health. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Florida officials says 90,000 mosquitoes negative for Zika
.B
No mosquitoes in Florida have tested positive for Zika virus, The Associated Press reported on Friday. Nearly 90,000 individual mosquitoes, in more than 6,500 pools of the insects, were tested with the support of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer services. Of those collected in 2017, none yielded a positive test result, the agency said in a statement. Humans contract the Zika virus through bites by infected Aedes mosquitoes. There are usually little to no symptoms but for pregnant women, Zika can infect the fetus and cause a number of devastating birth defects from preterm labor, abnormal brain growth, among others. People in subtropic areas are encouraged to wear bug spray to protect against mosquito bites and the Zika virus. Last month, the National Institutes of Health announced the next phase of testing for a Zika vaccine, moving onto an expanded human trial with thousands of test subjects. Scientists hope to complete the study by 2019. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Samantha Bee’s show briefly upstages correspondents’ dinner
.B
WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington’s once-glitzy “nerd prom” was briefly upstaged Saturday as comedians and Hollywood stars gathered for jokes and jests about President Donald Trump for a tongue-in-cheek event to counter the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Late-night TV star Samantha Bee pulled in celebrities for the first “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner”: Alysia Reiner of “Orange Is the New Black,” Retta of “Parks and Recreation” and Matt Walsh of “Veep.” Bee’s show, a comedic tribute to American news organizations, featured actor Will Ferrell and other guests roasting Trump and his allies. The star power of the real correspondents’ dinner took a hit this year when Trump declined to attend, the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to skip it. In Reagan’s case, he was recovering from an assassination attempt. Trump did his own counter-programming, scheduling a rally Saturday night in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to mark his 100th day in office. PHOTOS: In Trump's absence, 'nerd prom' challenged by Bee's bash The absence of the president himself at the WHCA dinner  or even officials from the administration seemed to diminish attendance by big names in film, television and sports. Barack Obama’s humorous remarks had become a highlight at the dinner. Last year, for Obama’s final appearance, the crowd included Will Smith, Emma Watson, Kerry Washington, Helen Mirren and model Kendall Jenner. For years, the event offered Washington’s press corps an opportunity to wear black tie and stunning gowns while mixing with celebrities. With Trump out, organizers put the focus on the First Amendment and the role of the press in democracy. The scheduled headliners were Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, set to present journalism awards. Woodward told The Washington Post the two planned to speak about “the First Amendment and the importance of aggressive but fair reporting.” The dinner still booked a master of ceremonies: Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show.” Broadcast coverage was to begin at 9:30 p.m. on C-SPAN, followed by Bee’s event airing on TBS at 10 p.m. Jeff Mason, the WHCA president, said this year would have been different even if Trump had attended, “based on the tension that has existed in the relationship and some of the things he has said about the press. We were preparing for a different dinner either way.” Trump has called the media “fake” and “dishonest” and even “the enemy of the people.” In an emailed fundraising appeal before leaving for Pennsylvania, Trump cited among the accomplishments over his first 100 days, “We fought back against the media’s lies.” Mason promised that Minhaj would use his comedy chops, without “roasting the president in absentia.” “People don’t want to come to a dinner and feel bored or preached at. Hopefully neither of those things will happen,” Mason said. Bee, who hosts TBS’ weekly show “Full Frontal,” said she cared deeply about the press. “For God’s sake, we could not do our show if things were more restricted. So, boy, nobody needs press freedom more than we do,” she told The Associated Press in an interview. Bee’s taped show singled out the Committee to Protect Journalists, the nonprofit group that will receive proceeds from the show. The show humorously assailed topics like “alternative facts,” a remark once made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway that drew heavy criticism. The official WHCA dinner began in 1921. Most people trace the development of the celebrity guests to 1987, when Baltimore Sun reporter Michael Kelly brought Fawn Hall, the secretary at the center of the Iran-Contra affair. ___ Associated Press writer Jocelyn Noveck contributed to this report.

Fyre Fest fiasco: Bahamas party lives, dies on social media
.B
In this day and age, the young and beautiful live and die on social media. And it’s been a sudden and ugly death for the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a multiday music, art and culture party that promised “an invitation to let loose and unplug with the likeminded” on the Bahamian island of Exuma. The festival’s rise and fall has played out in real time on YouTube and filtered through Facebook, where would-be party goers are putting their anger on display. Instead of photos of boozy good times, people have posted pictures of rows of white tents that look like “Stormtrooper helmets,” blue port-a-potties near half-constructed plywood structures and limp, lifeless cheese sandwiches. Organizers canceled the event at the last minute after poor planning, disorganization and lack of accommodations. Most of the A-list acts had pulled out days before, saying they hadn’t been paid. It was supposed to be a sun-soaked experience filled with yachts, gourmet food and models. Ticket prices ranged from $500 to $12,000. But by Saturday morning, the partygoers had decamped, many of them to hotels in Miami in hopes of salvaging a weekend. People decried the festival accommodations as being like a “disaster tent city” and a “refugee camp.” The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism says it’s deeply disappointed. “Hundreds of visitors to Exuma were met with total disorganization and chaos,” the tourism office wrote in a statement to the media. Fyre Festival co-organizer Billy McFarland promised full refunds on the festival’s website Saturday. “We will be working on refunds over the next few days and will be in touch directly with guests with more details. Also, all guests from this year will have free VIP passes to next year’s festival,” he wrote. The hype began months ago, marketed with slick videos on social media. “I saw it on Instagram and booked it before the lineup was announced,” said Mitch Purgason, a 25-year-old bespoke menswear designer in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Instagram ads looked especially “ridiculous” - parlance for amazing - what with models like Gigi Hadid and rapper Ja Rule. Blink-182 was supposed to perform. Photos of the impossibly blue water and the sugary sandy beach looked incredible. What’s more: Wild, docile pigs lived on the beach and swam in the warm water, perfect props for a killer Instagram selfie. Although the festival on the island chain east of Florida appeared to cater to the Millennial trust fund crowd, it was people like Purgason and 29-year-old Jake Strang of Pittsburgh who purchased early tickets - young professionals who wanted to spend a fun weekend in the tropics. Both men paid $500 for a flight from Miami to the island along with lodging and food. Strang and seven of his friends planned the trip to coincide with a birthday. They reserved a “lodge” for eight, with four king beds and a seating area in the middle. “Everything made it look amazing,” said Strang. The festival website promised a treasure hunt of “exceptional proportions,” with more than $1 million in riches to be found on a private island. Purgason said he was skeptical, but planned the vacation anyway. “Worst case scenario, I figured, we’re still in the Bahamas in a villa.” His first inkling something was amiss came on Thursday morning, after the first flight from Miami to Exuma. Organizers said the villas weren’t ready, so they whisked the planeload of partygoers to a restaurant at a nearby resort. It wasn’t a private island at all, but food and drink were free and plenty. Cute pigs and bikini-clad girls roamed the beach. There was a DJ. “They actually treated us pretty well,” he said. “The first three hours was dope.” Jenna Conlin, 30, an advertising professional from Venice, California, said, “They were putting down bottles of tequila on every table in an attempt to make everybody happy.” Strang flew in later Thursday and wasn’t so lucky. “When we arrived, it essentially looked like a construction site. It looked like they were trying to sell lots for homes,” he said. A promoter told festival goers to find tents and waved his arm in a direction. But the tents had holes that had obviously allowed rain to come in, because the beds were wet. They were given a Styrofoam container of food: “two slices of ham, lettuce and one slice of cheese on soggy bread,” Strang said. A few lucky patrons had been relocated to resorts. Most had to find beds in the tents. Available rooms aren’t easy to grab on Exuma, a small island with a population of about 7,000 that lacks the well-developed tourist infrastructure of Nassau or Freeport. The island’s hotels were already booked months in advance for a well-known regatta, wrote Robert Carron, owner of the Bahamas Tribune newspaper. By daybreak, people were already lining up to complain, and buses began returning them to the airport. Soon, it was official: The festival was cancelled. Word got out via social media that organizers said “circumstances out of our control” prevented them from preparing the “physical infrastructure” necessary for the event on the largely undeveloped island. “I’m heartbroken at this moment,” Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, said on Twitter. “I wanted this to be an amazing event. It was not a scam as everyone is reporting. I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

New ‘Orange Is the New Black’ episodes leaked online after Netflix ignores ransom demand
.B
Unaired episodes of the hit Netflix original series “Orange Is the New Black” were leaked online Saturday after the video streaming service allegedly ignored the responsible party’s ransom demands. A hacker or hackers using the alias “The Dark Overlord” dumped 10 episodes from the series’ forthcoming season online over the weekend in the wake of an apparently unsuccessful extortion attempt targeting Netflix and Larson Studios, a post-production company based in Hollywood. The first episode from the series’ forthcoming season was uploaded Friday to The Pirate Bay, a file-sharing website, months after the shakedown attempt was allegedly first initiated and six weeks shy of its scheduled premiere. The remainder of the stolen episodes was similarly uploaded about 12 hours later and accompanied by a press release attributed to The Dark Overlord. “It didn’t have to be this way, Netflix. You’re going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was,” the statement said in part. Netflix acknowledged the incident in a statement Friday after the season premiere was leaked, but did not immediately weigh in publicly on the heels of Saturday’s release of nine additional episodes. “We are aware of the situation,” Netflix told Variety on Friday. “A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.” Indeed, the tech website Torrent Freak has since reported that the heist occurred as the result of a breach suffered by Larson Studios in late 2016, citing a recent interview with an individual affiliate with The Dark Overlord. “After we had a copy of their data safely in our possession, we asked that we be paid a small fee in exchange for non-disclosure,” the individual told Torrent Freak. Larson Studios initially agreed to The Dark Overlord’s demands but ultimately failed to pay the ransom, the individual said. “We’re not quite done yet, though,” The Dark Overlord said in the statement issued alongside the second leak. “There’s more Netflix on the feasting menu soon (in addition to the other studios, of course), but we’ll get to that later.” The fifth season of “Orange Is the New Black” is currently slated to be available for Netflix’s 100 million subscribers on June 9.

Physician who was dragged off flight settles with United
.B
The Kentucky doctor who was violently removed from a United Airlines flight reached a settlement with the airline Thursday, less than a month after cellphone video footage of the incident made international news. Lawyers for Dr. David Dao said the settlement was reached at the same time that United issued changes to improve customer service. A provision in the settlement requires its dollar amount to remain private. United issued a statement on its website highlighting 10 changes it will make to improve customer service. The first is limiting the use of law enforcement to safety and security issues only. On April 9 at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, United Express Flight 3411 was overbooked, and airline managers had asked passengers to give up their seats to allow the last-minute travel of four airline employees to Louisville International Airport. When no passengers acquiesced, the managers chose four at random. Three complied, but Dr. Dao refused. Airline managers directed airport security personnel to forcibly remove Dr. Dao. He bloodied his face on an armrest during the struggle, and he was dragged apparently unconscious through the plane as cellphones captured the incident on video. Dr. Dao’s lawyers said he suffered a concussion, injury to his sinuses, a broken nose and two broken teeth. A failure by United CEO Oscar Munoz to properly address and apologize for the incident drew condemnation from the public, media and government officials. “Mr. Munoz said he was going to do the right thing, and he has,” Dr. Dao’s lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, said in a statement. “Dr. Dao has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers.” “Our review shows that many things went wrong that day, but the headline is clear: Our policies got in the way of our values and procedures interfered in doing what’s right,” Mr. Munoz said in a statement. One change United introduced Thursday directs managers to offer passengers up to $10,000 in compensation to voluntarily give up their seats. The federal Transportation Department requires airlines to offer a maximum compensation of $1,350, but the Flight 3411 staff offered only $800 and the cost of meals and hotels. In the immediate aftermath of the April 9 incident, Delta Air Lines said it would offer $10,000 compensation to passengers on overbooked flights. Other changes at United include: ⦁ Reducing the amount of overbooking. ⦁ Not forcing seated passengers to give up their seats unless safety or security is at risk. ⦁ Creating an automated system for soliciting volunteers to change travel plans. ⦁ Ensuring staffers are booked onto flights at least an hour before departure. ⦁ Eliminating the red tape on permanently lost bags by adopting a “no questions asked” policy on lost luggage. In addition, United said it will provide more training for employees and empower them to resolve customer service issues in the moment. The airline also will set up a “customer solutions team to provide agents with creative solutions such as using nearby airports, other airlines or ground transportations to get customers to their final destination.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

.B
DALLAS (AP) — United Airlines says it will raise the limit — to $10,000 — on payments to customers who give up seats on oversold flights. It’s also increasing training for employees as it deals with fallout from the video of a passenger being violently dragged from his seat. United is also vowing to reduce, but not eliminate, overbooking — the selling of more tickets than there are seats on the plane. The airline made the promises Thursday as it released a report detailing mistakes that led to the April 9 incident on a United Express plane in Chicago. United isn’t saying whether ticket sales have dropped since the removal of a 69-year-old passenger by three airport security officers, but the airline’s CEO admits it could be damaging.

‘Underworld: Blood Wars’ review (4K UHD)
.B
The never-ending war between vampire and werewolf returned to theaters last year in yet another sequel (that’s five movies in total) for a long-of-the-fang franchise. Now ready to take a bite into the 4K UHD lovers’ precious time, the fantasy horror drama Underworld: Blood Wars(Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, rated R, 91 minutes, 2.40:1 aspect ratio, $45.95) offers the return of the icy but perpetually gorgeous Kate Beckinsale as the assassin Selene, a vampiric female killing machine hunted by her own kind and lycan due to her habit of spreading death around her. Besides more killing this time out, she has hidden her hybrid daughter Eve from both sides looking to harvest the child’s blood. Selene is now on the run with an elder vampire’s son named David (Theo James) as they seek sanctuary with the frosty Nordic Coven before dealing with another series of attacks from their supernatural enemies. More of a made-for-TV movie than blockbuster, the film sucks the life out of viewers through long-winded dialogue passages and dimly lit action sequences crammed into its abbreviated run time. Only a final, too-brief, bloody confrontation featuring an army of those Nordic vampires versus werewolves, incorporating sword play and use of a massive gun, stands out and should guarantee fanatics of the series will devour the latest chapter. 4K UHD in action: It’s hard to admire the upscaling of the 2K source material to the ultra high-definition format with a high-dynamic range when most of the movie takes place after sundown and in dingy environments (that dang creatures-of-the-night dilemma). However, the disc has its moments. Specifically, fans will appreciate the dynamic detail of a vampire dissolving into burning embers after being shot by an ultraviolet bullet; Selene and David climbing a snow wall, while the great-looking Northern Lights glow above them; a werewolf getting split in half; and a bloody spinal column ripped from the back of an enemy. Not so great is being too acutely aware of a pair of hair strands swinging like a pendulum in front of Selene’s face for most of the movie. Dang lady, get that coif under control. Best extras: Viewers must go the Blu-ray disc to find roughly 30 minutes of featurettes about the production. Most intriguing is the 8-minute segment that quickly covers the film history of the famed Death Dealer Selene with support from previous movie clips, interview snippets with Miss Beckinsale, and gushes from her co-stars and director Anna Foerster. The segment gives away most of the movie, so don’t watch until after the main event. Most disturbing moment is a producer threatening a sixth “Underworld” movie. Another extra worth mentioning is access to a virtual copy of the entire 78-page, sequential-art adaptation of the movie by Darkstorm Comics. Now, although I still appreciate reading a comic book, trying to flip through pages with my controller and reading dialogue bubbles of sequential-art panels on even a 65-inch screen was near impossible. The book would have been much better served if offered as a motion comic for the passive viewer or delivered as a code for download on any popular tablet device.

Commerce Secretary Ross announces investigation into imported aluminum
.B
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced Wednesday that the Trump administration was launching a new investigation into imported aluminum, looking at the impact a flood of imports has on U.S. economic and defense security. The probe, similar to one initiated last week into steel, will determine whether subsidies or other unfair practices in countries such as China justify imposing countervailing duties or other measure to protect U.S. industries. “Imports have been flooding in to the aluminum industry,” Mr. Ross said. The Commerce Department has 270 days to complete the investigation and make a recommendation to the president. But Mr. Ross said the investigation likely would be completed before the deadline. The probe by the Commerce Department, known as a Section 232 investigation, is part of a series of get-tough moves on trade. The Trump administrant also is expected to soon take steps to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Ross wouldn’t confirm a timeline for tackling NAFTA but said the aluminum investigation and other moves stemmed from Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on bad trade deals. “The president said he was going to be tougher on trade,” said Mr. Ross. “This follows quite logically with him following though on his campaign promises.” Aluminum imports have a direct impact on the U.S. military. Mr. Ross noted that high-quality aluminum is used in the F-35 and F-18 fighters, C-17 transport aircraft, and in armor plating for a variety of military vehicles, vessels and missiles. “The problem we have is there is only one American smelter that produces the high-purity aluminum needed for these uses. Just one,” he said. “Even worse, eight U.S. smelters have either closed or curbed production since 2015. There are only two U.S. smelters fully operational as we stand here today.” A glut in global aluminum supply, some of it driven by countries that subsidize production, has driven down prices and U.S. producers claim they have been unfairly undercut. U.S. aluminum output has dropped to 1955 levels, said Mr. Ross. He said that China was a major playing in aluminum but oversupply was a global problem. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Dent, moderate House member, still refuses to support GOP health care bill

Rep. Charlie Dent said Thursday he’s still not onboard with the GOP’s revised health care bill. The Pennsylvania Republican said on MSNBC that there are areas that need more work before he’ll be able to support the legislation, and some of the amendments added have actually taken away support from some moderates. “I suspect there will be a vote when there are enough votes to pass it,” Mr. Dent said. “This amendment hasn’t really brought in a lot of people from the center right.” SEE ALSO: Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill Mr. Dent said the focus needs to be more on the individual market and that he wanted to see more Democrats participating in drafting the legislation instead of a one party push. Mr. Dent is the leader of the moderate Tuesday Group, who went to battle with the conservative Freedom Caucus over the last Republican health bill in March.

Kansas governor seeks $24M to ban guns at state hospitals
.B
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Republican Gov. Sam Brownback proposed Thursday spending an additional $24 million over two years on armed guards and other security measures that would allow Kansas to continue banning concealed guns at state hospitals for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. The proposal immediately renewed a debate over allowing concealed weapons in public hospitals, mental health centers, state universities and colleges. A state law will require such facilities to allow concealed guns inside starting July 1 if the buildings don’t have extra security measures such as guards and metal detectors. Brownback submitted his proposal to the GOP-controlled Legislature, even though administration officials have worked with lawmakers on revising the gun-rights law. While many legislators want to change the law, gun-rights groups have strongly resisted. Brownback signed the 2013 concealed carry measure into law and is a strong gun-rights supporter. House and Senate budget committee members who reviewed the proposal criticized Brownback’s administration for submitting it only this week, with lawmakers returning Monday from a spring break to wrap up the year’s business. They doubted the state could hire all the new employees and train them before July - something an administration official confirmed - allowing guns in the meantime. “It’s pretty short-sighted to be coming to us this late in the day,” said state Rep. Erin Davis, an Olathe Republican. The gun-rights law was enacted in 2013 to ensure that gun owners could bring concealed weapons into a greater number of public buildings; Kansas later ended a requirement for a state permit to carry concealed. The law gave public hospitals, mental health centers, universities and colleges a four-year exemption, which expires July 1. State higher education officials have been preparing for the change for months, drafting new policies for dealing with guns in their buildings, and the three largest universities plan to spend more than $2 million to keep weapons out of sporting events. Some lawmakers contend the 2013 law should remain unchanged because it allows gun owners to protect themselves. Others disagree over which institutions should be allowed to continue banning guns, though support appears strongest for public hospitals, including the four state hospitals. “If they’re going to spend the money, they want to spend it on the patients,” said Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, an Overland Park Republican. The Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the state hospitals, also has discussed gun legislation with lawmakers. “It’s just that, to date, there’s been no movement,” said Cory Gwaltney, the agency’s legislative director. Brownback’s proposal includes $810,000 for metal detectors at the state’s hospitals for the mentally ill in Larned and Osawatomie and its hospitals for the developmentally disabled in Parsons and Topeka. But most of the new costs - $23.4 million over two years - would be hiring 180 new employees, including “armed personnel.” The proposal calls for the spending to start only on July 1, and Gwaltney acknowledged that the state would need three or four months to get the new workers hired. ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

President Trump blasts federal court for blocking his executive order
.B
President Trump and his top aides have lashed out at the federal court that blocked his anti-sanctuary city executive order, with the president calling the ruling “ridiculous” and his press secretary saying sanctuaries like San Francisco have “the blood of dead Americans on their hands.” Mr. Trump vowed Wednesday to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, dismissing the new ruling as the latest errant decision from the country’s most liberal judicial circuit. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick bungled federal immigration law and undercuts Americans’ faith in government. “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” Mr. Spicer said in a scorching statement. “But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the United States.” The stern reaction from the White House is all the more striking because it departs from the Justice Department, which took a more positive approach toward Judge Orrick’s decision. Department spokesman Ian D. Prior said rather than blocking Mr. Trump, the key part of Tuesday’s ruling endorsed the administration’s current approach to sanctuary cities, clearing the way for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withhold funding under three key grant programs. Judge Orrick, who sits in San Francisco, ruled that Mr. Trump overstepped his bounds by trying to impose new restrictions on federal grants issued to states, counties and cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation agents. The judge said Congress, not Mr. Trump, has the power of the purse and gets to decide what strings are attached. Judge Orrick issued an injunction against part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order threatening to withhold potentially tens of billions of dollars from sanctuary cities. But the judge said in instances where Congress has already approved strings — such as the three Justice Department programs — Mr. Trump can withhold the money. The Justice Department said those programs — the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, COPS funding and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program — were the ones they had planned to target anyway. Mr. Spicer said the judge was ignoring that federal law and the powers it granted to the administration. He also attacked Santa Clara and San Francisco, the two counties in California that had sued to halt Mr. Trump’s executive order. “San Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the well-being of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands,” Mr. Spicer said. San Francisco became the chief target in the sanctuary city debate after the 2015 slaying of Kate Steinle. The man standing trial for her killing is an illegal immigrant shielded from deportation by the city’s policies. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

D.C. region to host ‘full-scale’ counterterrorism drill Wednesday
.B
Emergency personnel across the nation’s capital and surrounding area plan to conduct a “full-scale” counterterrorism exercise Wednesday in Maryland, Virginia and D.C. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders will participate in drills across the region Wednesday meant to prepare for the possibility of a “complex coordinated terror attack,” organizers said in a statement. “The regional exercise will be staged at six sites in the District of Columbia, suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia, and will involve hundreds of police, fire and emergency medical service personnel and volunteer actors,” said the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a nonprofit association comprised of local governments from throughout greater Washington metropolitan area. “Law enforcement officials practice and exercise their skills on their own regularly because that’s the best way to ensure we are always ready to respond quickly and professionally,” said Scott Boggs, managing director of homeland security and public safety at COG. “On April 26, we’ll go one step further and stage a very realistic emergency event involving multiple sites and actors posing as the casualties. The drill has been in the works for more than a year in the wake of terror attacks such as the 2015 assault in Paris that unfolded at multiple locations ranging from cafes and restaurants to a concert hall, Newsweek reported. “An event that has multiple locations that don’t necessarily follow jurisdictional lines poses a challenge for command and control, resourcing, things of that nature. It’s only appropriate for us to approach that regionally and ensure that we’re all prepared for and ready to manage it,” Mr. Boggs told Newsweek. “The target of the exercise is to make sure that we’re prepared. What we don’t want is the side effect of creating concern or fear because of the activities associated with the exercise,” he said. Area residents likely affected by the exercise will be warned in advance, the MWCOG said in a statement Monday, but organizers are otherwise trying to keep details about the drill under wraps. “To some degree they’re trying to make it a surprise for the participants,” MWCOG spokeswoman Jeanne Saddler told ARLnow in Arlington. “In order to maintain the exercise for participants and first responders, we have to avoid making a mention of locations.” While the organization declined to identify the specific locations involved in Wednesday’s exercise, ARLnow said members of the Arlington police SWAT team will take part in an exercise near George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. The region isn’t the only area to host counterterrorism drills as of late. About 200 emergency personnel participated in a simulated terror attack earlier this month in Jones Beach, New York, and over 80 agencies were involved in a drill in a recent Florida drill described as the largest emergency training exercise in the state’s history.

House intelligence panel targets Susan Rice in investigation of political spying operation
.B
Justice Department rules limit supplying politically sensitive information to the White House, a review of attorney general guidelines for domestic FBI intelligence investigations has found. A prohibition contained in the 2008 guidelines is a central focus of the ongoing House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence probe into Russian election meddling and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive U.S. intelligence communications intercepts. The prohibitions in guidelines may explain why the FBI so far has refused to cooperate with the House committee’s investigation. Specifically, as of Wednesday, the FBI still has not responded to a request for documents that could explain how the White House was able to “unmask” the names of Americans incidentally spied on during a foreign electronic intelligence operation that ran from November to January — the same months the Trump transition team was working. FBI spokesman Andrew Ames would not say why the bureau has not met the House committee’s document request. “The FBI will continue to work with our congressional oversight committees on their requests,” he told Inside the Ring. According to congressional sources, the investigation is trying to determine if Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser, was involved in a clandestine political spying operation using foreign surveillance as cover. Ms. Rice is expected to be a central witness in the coming weeks before committee investigators to explain the unmasking and wide dissemination of what the committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, has called improper electronic surveillance of Trump transition team officials. Mr. Nunes has said dozens of electronic intelligence reports appear to have revealed that information on Americans was improperly and widely disseminated throughout government during the presidential transition. The attorney general guidelines for the FBI state that “compromising information concerning domestic officials or political organizations, or information concerning activities of United States persons intended to affect the political process in the United States, may be disseminated to the White House only with the approval of the attorney general.” The sharing of compromising FBI information also must be “based on a determination that such dissemination is needed for foreign intelligence purposes, for the purpose of protecting against international terrorism or other threats to the national security, or for the conduct of foreign affairs.” The acting attorney general at the time was Sally Q. Yates, and the House committee is expected to question her in addition to Ms. Rice about the FBI’s role in the intelligence-gathering controversy. The guidelines also list six categories of sensitive information that can be routinely shared with the White House. They include information on foreign spy activities in the United States, signs of an imminent foreign attack or cyberattack, data on foreign leadership changes and information about foreign economic or political events that could have an impact on national security. The FBI can also share information with the White House if the information is outlined in regularly published national intelligence requirements. The guidelines were expanded in a bid to shift the FBI’s mission from being mainly a law enforcement agency to a domestic intelligence agency with both national security and law enforcement missions. Ms. Rice has denied engaging in political spying on Donald Trump or his team and has denied leaking any classified information. However, she suggested during an MSNBC interview on April 4 that she had requested the names of Americans redacted in foreign intelligence reports. “There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to, name not provided,” Ms. Rice said. “Sometimes in that context, in order to understand the significance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to request the information as to who that person was.” The New York Times reported in March that the Obama administration officials were “scrambling” during the final days to collect and disseminate intelligence on any ties between Mr. Trump and his team and Russia, fearing that once in office the president would destroy compromising information gathered by U.S. spies. The Obama administration also loosened rules on sharing raw electronic intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency on Dec. 15 — weeks before Mr. Obama left office. A 26-page directive signed by then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper has been criticized by privacy groups as posing new risks that Americans’ rights will be violated. CHINA, RUSSIA ADVANCE HYPERSONIC WEAPONS China recently disclosed details of its high-priority program to build ultra-high-speed maneuvering missiles, as Russia is advancing its hypersonic weapons. The Chinese program, which had been shrouded in secrecy, includes a nationwide research and technology program that has achieved what experts say is rapid advancement toward fielding weapons capable of defeating strategic missile defenses. China’s disclosures were made in early March during a conference on space planes and hypersonic systems, Aviation Week reported from China. “While progress in some specific defense areas — most notably the recent flight tests of the DF-ZF/WU-14 hypersonic glide vehicles — was not discussed, the progress indicated by the underlying research makes it readily apparent that China is making strides in hypersonic capability much faster than previously thought,” the magazine reported on April 14. The Chinese for the first time showed off an image of a scramjet-powered missile that can fly at speeds of up to Mach 7 (5,370 miles per hour) and at an altitude of 18.7 miles. China’s other system is the DF-ZF, a hypersonic glider that launched on a missile and maneuvers to its target. That system has been tested six times and has raised concerns in the U.S. military. Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, Strategic Command commander, told Congress this month that China’s development of hypersonic weapons was undermining U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy. In Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on April 20 that Moscow’s high-speed arms development is comparable to those of the United States. “We have said about it before, about the fact that we are developing our own systems within the framework of the issues related not to supersonic, but to hypersonic weapons on an equal level with the United States,” Mr. Rogozin said. “However, I would not like to comment on every leak connected to some sources in the defense industry or in the defense ministry.” He was referring to reports on Moscow’s Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced April 16 that some hypersonic weapons and other advanced arms will be deployed with the Russian military by 2025. The Pentagon is developing a space plane that could be used as a hypersonic weapon. It is also researching a scramjet-powered hypersonic missile and a hypersonic attack glider. PENTAGON: RUSSIA DID NOT TARGET U.S. CRUISE MISSILES One of the questions being asked inside the Pentagon is why Russia did not attempt to shoot down U.S. cruise missiles fired during the recent Tomahawk strike on a Syrian airfield. A total of 59 Tomahawk missiles were fired on the Shayrat Air Base on April 6, the airfield used by Syrian government jets to conduct a chemical weapons attack that killed civilians. Russia has deployed S-400 and S-300 anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems at the Tartus naval supply base and the Khmeimim air base to protect its forces supporting the Bashar Assad regime. The S-400s are capable of shooting down a variety of missiles, and the Tomahawks, fired from the guided missile destroyer USS Ross from the Mediterranean, passed through the target envelope of the S-400s, according to U.S. military officials. However, officials said the Russians did not fire at the missiles and did not turn on any targeting radar used by the S-400s during the U.S. strike, something that could have revealed the system’s capabilities. Asked about the issue, Central Command spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said: “We told the Russians a short time in advance we were going to strike. What they did or didn’t do with that information — or what their range, capabilities and intent are — is something you’d have to ask them.” Russia did not say why it didn’t shoot at the Tomahawks, but Moscow complained that the attack disrupted U.S.-Russian relations. Moscow temporarily shut down a communications channel with the Pentagon used to avoid conflicts by Russian and U.S. aircraft over Syria after the strike. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

President Trump’s tax reform
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: President Trump presented his eagerly anticipated tax-reform scheme Wednesday and the reviews were, as expected, mixed but hopeful. “Clearly we have a unique opportunity to do something major here,” said Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council. “It’s our intention to create a huge tax cut and equally as important, a huge simplification of the tax system in America.” The president would slash tax rates on businesses and make major changes to rates for individuals, some of them sure to raise the usual howls and squeals, but the result would be real reform of a tax system that Jimmy Carter famously called “a disgrace to the human race.” (Dogs and cats didn’t like it, either.) The reforms largely reflect the campaign promises Mr. Trump made, to wide applause, in his campaign for president. But there are stark differences. One change likely to provoke objections would repeal provisions enabling individual taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from reportable income on which they pay federal income tax. This would particularly hurt taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey. The Trump proposal would impose a top tax rate of 35 percent on individuals, down from 39.6 percent at present but more than the 33 percent he proposed on the stump. A standard deduction for everyone would be doubled, but deductions except for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, including those to religious institutions, would be eliminated. President Trump and many economists argue that tax cuts will make the economy, sluggish over the past eight years, blossom and grow, restrain deficits and restore public confidence in the government. “We’ve been hearing from the [Obama] administration that 3 percent growth is hard to get to, and they couldn’t get there,” says Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury, “and that’s why we got this new president. If there had been a 3 percent growth maybe there would have been a different outcome.” But the president’s tax-cut proposal, like his proposed budget, is just that, a proposal. Presidents propose and Congress can, and usually does, dispose. Republicans generally praised the president’s proposal in the hours leading up to the president’s announcement as details began to emerge from the White House. But many congressmen in the Grand Old Party are split on the size of the tax cuts in the Grand Old Proposal, and which tax breaks, particularly for business, should stay or go away. Unless Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, and Speaker Paul Ryan in the House can keep their troops in line for whatever final reform emerges — and that’s always a big Republican “if” — the White House will need Democratic votes. Sen. Charles Schumer, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, chimed in with the expected discordant note from his place in the shade of the no-no tree, reflecting the Democratic view that Mr. Trump’s proposals are tilted heavily in favor of the prosperous. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee that will send the final proposal to Congress, sounded a more positive note. “It really makes clear the president’s commitment to tax reform and delivering it in a very bold way this year,” he says. “We’ve still got some work to do. There’s no question about it.” But tax reform is finally on the table, and that’s a start. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Democrats recycle Gorsuch questions for Thapur
.B
Democrats weren’t able to derail Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, but they haven’t abandoned the pointed questions they aimed at him, recycling those questions Wednesday for a hearing with appeals court nominee Judge Amul R. Thapar. From campaign finance reform cases to his ties to the conservative Federalist Society, Judge Thapar fended off the inquiries during his confirmation hearing, asking to be evaluated on the reputation he amassed during more than a decade on the federal bench. He also batted away an attempt by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, to force him into a confrontation with President Trump, whose criticism of federal courts has riled critics. “I am a proud Article III judge. We’ve been criticized from the beginning of this great country. Thomas Jefferson went after Chief Justice Marshall, and I appreciate the protection other branches provide to us,” Judge Thapal said. “It doesn’t matter to us.” Mr. Blumenthal was nonplussed. “It doesn’t matter to you, judge, but it does matter to the powers of the federal courts that the American public respect and trust the federal judiciary,” said Mr. Blumenthal. Judge Thapar is Mr. Trump’s nominee to fill an empty seat on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals — the first of what’s expected to be a series of picks to fill nearly 20 appeals court vacancies nationwide. Democrats, who lost their battle to derail Justice Gorsuch earlier this month, are trying to figure out how to handle Mr. Trump’s other court nominees. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse prodded the judge on his views about campaign finance, following a line of questioning he aimed at Justice Gorsuch. Mr. Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, wants judicial nominees to criticize the state of campaign finance law following the 2010 Citizens United case, where the Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment protected corporations’ and labor unions’ right to political speech. The senator said he rejected Judge Thapar’s past comments saying political donations are the equivalent of speech. “Those of us who are in politics know that is a false statement,” said Mr. Whitehouse. “That is indeed a preposterous statement factually because money has a completely different effect than speech once it enters the political arena.” Judge Thapar was prodded about his ruling in a case where he opposed campaign ethics rules for judicial candidates in Kentucky that would have limited their contributions in partisan politics. “This was a really hard case,” the judge said. “If the Supreme Court were to say I’m wrong, then I understand that.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced Judge Thapar, who is from his home state of Kentucky, at the hearing. Mr. McConnell noted Judge Thapar received the highest judicial qualification rating from the American Bar Association. But Democrats said they were more worried about the judge’s ties to another legal group, The Federalist Society, which is an association of conservative and libertarian-leaning legal scholars and students. The Federalist Society helped craft a list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Mr. Trump, and both Justice Gorsuch and Judge Thapar were on the list. Mr. Whitehouse accused The Federalist Society of “trying to bring its corporate interests to the court.” Judge Thapar dismissed the guilt-by-association charge, asking to be judged on his own rulings. “If you look at the entirety of my record, what you would see and what you would hear from lawyers is that I’m fair,” said Judge Thapar, quoting a criminal defense attorney who said, “I don’t know his politics, I just know he will rule by the book.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill
.B
The White House told congressional leaders Wednesday that the administration will continue making Obamacare cost-sharing payments, eliminating the biggest sticking point as lawmakers rush to pass a final 2017 spending bill and avert a government shutdown looming at the end of the week. Democrats had wanted to include the funds in the spending bill, but Republicans had balked, saying they’d never been included before — though President Barack Obama had doled out the money anyway, in what a judge has ruled an illegal expense. The Trump administration’s promise to continue the payments without congressional approval preserves a GOP anti-Obamacare lawsuit, but still keeps the money flowing, which Democrats said was their most important goal. SEE ALSO: GOP lawmakers push one-week stopgap bill to prevent government shutdown “Our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about the [cost-sharing] payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. We’ve now made progress on both of these fronts,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. Mr. Trump agreed earlier this week to pull his demand that money for his wall be included in the spending bill. That put pressure on Democrats to drop their insistence on Obamacare funding. But Mrs. Pelosi said a deal is still proving elusive. “More progress needs to be made on some of our priorities, and we continue to be concerned about poison-pill riders that are still in this legislation,” she said. “Our appropriators are working in good faith toward a bipartisan proposal to keep government open.” The government has been running on stopgap funding since Oct. 1, or nearly seven months. Congress needs to pass a new bill by midnight Friday or else the government will face a partial shutdown. Late Wednesday, House Republicans announced a one-week stopgap bill that would carry the government through May 5. That bill, which needs to pass by Friday, would buy more room for negotiations. Obamacare payments emerged as a stumbling block earlier this month after Mr. Trump threatened to withhold the money as a negotiating tactic on the broader health care repeal. Democrats demanded certainty in the money, saying the health markets count on those payments to make Obamacare work. House Republicans, however, had challenged the payments as illegal, saying Congress had specifically nixed the money. A federal judge agreed with them, ruling Mr. Obama acted illegally. Including the payments in the new spending bill could have invalidated that lawsuit — though even some Republicans said it wasn’t fair to end the payments now while the rest of Obamacare is intact. “A lot of us, myself included, think those subsidies ought to be continued until we have an alternative. I think we owe that to the companies, I think you owe that to the people in the health care system,” said Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican. Having the White House agree to make the payments was the middle-ground solution. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Wednesday morning that there were still other stumbling blocks, including federal support for a health fund for retired miners and money to bolster Puerto Rico’s struggling Medicaid system. An even bigger hurdle, though, appears to be the personalities involved. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he’d been pushing Mr. Schumer to negotiate directly with the White House to try to get a bill done, but said the Democratic leader was refusing even to talk to the president. Mr. Schumer countered that was because he wasn’t going to negotiate at all as long as Mr. Trump was seeking funding for the border wall. “Senator McConnell wanted me to negotiate the wall with President Trump. I said to him two things: First, it’s not a negotiation. No wall. And second, I said, only you can persuade him that he shouldn’t do the wall because it’ll cause a government shutdown,” Mr. Schumer said. And Mr. Trump himself took to Twitter on Wednesday evening to blame the Democrats’ demands for the difficult negotiations. “Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!” he wrote. Democrats’ disdain for Mr. Trump bled over into the House as well, where Mrs. Pelosi met with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Tuesday night, and then attacked him as an obstructionist a day later. “Congressman Mick Mulvaney was a chief architect of the government shutdown in 2013. He not only voted to shut down government but voted against ending the shutdown. He also voted to default on the full faith and credit of the United States,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Democrats are confident that if there is a government shutdown, the GOP would take the blame, emboldening the minority party to press its demands. But Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said Democrats are the ones angling for a shutdown, believing it will energize their base. “I think Chuck Schumer and the Democrats want a shutdown,” he continued, “I think they’re trying to provoke a fight.” • Tom Howell Jr. and Sally Persons contributed to this article.

GOP lawmakers push one-week stopgap bill to prevent government shutdown
.B
House Republicans introduced a short-term spending bill late Wednesday that would avoid and end-of-week government shutdown and buy seven more days’ time to finalize a full 2017 spending deal. If the one-week extension passes it means the government will have operated on stop-gap funding for more than seven months of the year. The current funding expires at midnight Friday. The new bill would extend funding through May 5, averting a partial shutdown that would ensue without any more money in the pipeline. SEE ALSO: Trump will continue Obamacare payments, clearing major hurdle on spending bill “This continuing resolution will continue to keep the government open and operating as normal for the next several days, in order to finalize legislation to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year,” said Rep. Rodney Frelinguysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Negotiations on the full 2017 bill hit snags earlier this week when Democrats insisted on including controversial Obamacare money and President Trump insisted on initial funding for his border wall.

Congress sends Trump stopgap spending bill, buys another week until next shutdown deadline
.B
Congress sent President Trump a stopgap spending bill Friday that would avert a government shutdown at midnight and give negotiators another week to agree on long-term funding. The bill easily passed the House in a 382-30 vote and then sailed through the Senate in a voice vote. The measure, which Mr. Trump is expected to sign, would give Congress another week to negotiate a bill to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. Most of the major disputes preventing a long-term spending bill were resolved earlier in the week, but Republicans and Democrats continued to haggle over issues such as helping address Puerto Rico’s Medicaid crisis and fixing health care for miners. Earlier in the week, President Trump took steps to clear the way for a deal on a long-term spending bill. Senate Democrats responded with further demands. The president dropped his demand for funding for a wall on the border with Mexico, saying enough money was available for planning the project. Mr. Trump also agreed to continue with crucial Obamacare payments that was the top demand from Democrats. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Trump tosses Obama’s offshore drilling limits: ‘We’re opening it up’
.B
Reversing yet another of his predecessor’s actions on energy and the environment, President Trump on Friday signed an executive order that paves the way for a massive increase in offshore oil-and-gas drilling. In brief remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said the order — which is likely to result in new energy exploration in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico — will boost the nation’s economy and directly create jobs. The order undoes former President Obama’s ban on new offshore drilling leases in the Atlantic and Arctic, which was put in place during the final weeks of his term. It also directs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to conduct a more thorough review of the nation’s entire offshore drilling policy. “We’re opening it up,” the president said. “Today we’re unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs. Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves … This executive order starts the process of opening offshore areas to job-creating energy exploration. It reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban, so hear that — it reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban, and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our treasury and jobs to our workers.” Environmentalists immediately panned the move and said it’s yet another sign that the White House is beholden to the fossil fuels industry. “When President Obama withdrew irreplaceable and sensitive waters of the Arctic Ocean and important parts of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling, it was a bold step in protecting these seas for our future and girding the global community against the worst effects of climate change,” said Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice. “Trump is again going all-in for his Big Oil backers, with an executive order that attempts to undo President Obama’s historic action.” The White House and outside specialists have estimated that as much as 94 percent of the nation’s offshore areas remain closed off to energy exploration. Federal revenues from offshore drilling leases have dropped from about $18 billion in 2008 to about $2.8 billion in 2016, according to the Interior Department. Opening up at least some of the off-limits area will be a boon for the nation’s economy, according to Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for 21st Century Energy. “Now, the Trump administration is stepping in to take immediate action that will bring back production in parts of the Arctic and Atlantic that were taken off limits, and also conduct a more comprehensive review of our offshore policies,” she said. “We are hopeful that this evaluation will lead to opportunities for production in the Mid-Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, including the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and expanded access in Alaska.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

White House economic adviser says health care still the priority despite new tax plan
.B
Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Friday that health care is still the priority for the White House despite the newly released tax plan. Mr. Cohn said on Fox Business, “We’d love to get health care done first. And there is a team working on health care.” He emphasized that although the team would like the health plan to be done first, they have have made provisions in the tax plan that could still help rollback some parts of Obamacare. “We feel like we’re very close to a health care bill. Hopefully that gets done over the weekend or next week, more likely next week, if that doesn’t get done, and I think it will get done, we have also put in the tax plan the repeal of the 3.8 percent additional Obamacare tax on capital gains and dividends.” Mr. Cohn also emphasized, however, that the administration has been talking to a variety of groups about the health care plan and that they want it to have support from all sides. “We want to get this right. We want to deliver a tax bill day one that we think has universal support out there,” he said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

NEW YORK (AP) - Protesters in New York City marked Donald Trump’s 100th day in office by gathering in front of his Fifth Avenue home to proclaim that he’s a failure as president. On Saturday, they joined a nationwide day of action called “100 Days of Failure.” Activists highlighted policies they say are not only failing Americans, but also endangering people around the world. Neil Mitchell says the president “has the House, he has the Senate, he has the White House, and he hasn’t been able to do anything.” The Bronx resident says Trump is an example of what he called “blind incompetence.” New York participants created signs that detailed 100 ways they say the Trump administration is reversing progress in areas including climate change, immigration, health care, foreign policy and women’s rights.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - Three western Kansas men accused of plotting to attack Somali immigrants in Garden City are asking for a delay in their federal trial. Attorneys for Curtis Wayne Allen, Patrick Eugene Stein and Gavin Wayne Wright jointly filed the motion Friday. Federal prosecutors joined in the request. The Hutchinson News reports (http://bit.ly/2pshW8F ) U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren did not immediately act on the motion. The trial is currently scheduled to begin June 13. The three men, all members of a small regional militia group, are accused of conspiring to detonate truck bombs at an apartment complex where about 120 Somali immigrants live in Garden City. The motion notes the case is complex, one of the defendants was recently appointed a new attorney and the large amount of evidence to be reviewed. ___ Information from: The Hutchinson (Kan.)

Washington state school district halts international trips
.B
KENT, Wash. (AP) - A school district in Washington state has halted all international field trips over concerns students in the country illegally wouldn’t be able to get back in. The Kent School District’s Board of Directors announced the decision Wednesday, The Seattle Times reported (http://bit.ly/2p7zusN ). The decision immediately canceled an education exchange to Osaka, Japan, and a band trip to Victoria, British Columbia, in Canada. District spokesman Chris Loftis said confusing messages from President Donald Trump’s administration caused uncertainty about whether students would be allowed back into the U.S. “You cannot go on a field trip with 60 kids and come back with 59,” he said. The school district said it has students from 100 countries who speak 135 languages. The district doesn’t track students’ immigration status because of a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that says it’s unconstitutional to deny children in the country illegally a free and public education, Loftis said. But when a school official called U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency said there was a very high chance a student would be detained at the border if the student lacked information needed to get back in, Loftis said. “Immigration laws have not changed,” the agency said in a statement. “In accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, all travelers seeking to enter the United States must prove to the inspecting officer that they are legally entitled to enter the United States.” Months of planning and fundraising go into international trips, Kent school board President Karen DeBruler said. “It’s not fair for them not to go, but things are changing on a very unprecedented basis,” she said, noting that keeping the international trips meant students who couldn’t go would be “exposed as being undocumented.” Many students reacted with dismay to the canceled band trip to Canada, including 17-year-old Molly Barlett, who said the trip was the highlight of the band program. “I feel bad, but I don’t think we should stop the whole trip just because they can’t go,” she said. “I understand why they (the board) did it, but it also drives me nuts because we’ve gone on other trips and had no problem with border stuff.” ___ Information from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - A Green Bay alderman concerned about residents with visible guns at public meetings says he’ll talk with state legislators about allowing a ban on openly carrying firearms. Alderman Randy Scannell says his intent is not to prohibit residents from having their guns in public if that makes them feel safer. But he wants the firearms concealed to ease concerns from others at meetings. The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports (http://gbpg.net/2oT0UyB ) the problem with Scannell’s idea is Wisconsin’s law on open-carry prohibits concealment. Scannell says municipalities can ban firearms in public buildings altogether but that’s not what he wants. Scannell says he began looking into the issue after constituents expressed fear about speaking at a contentious City Council meeting earlier this year because they saw a resident wearing a gun on his hip. ___ Information from: Press-Gazette Media, http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

NEW YORK (AP) - It’s payback time for Columbia University. The Ivy League school that has expanded its campus into West Harlem is staging what it calls “Saturday Science” - inviting local children to come and learn how the human brain works. It’s part of a new public education series at the university’s Jerome L. Greene Science Center on West 129th Street. That’s  the first Columbia building to be completed in the ongoing, 17-acre expansion. Some of the land was seized under eminent domain after the area was designated as blighted. On Saturday afternoon, local children will hear how the brain communicates with the body. The series fulfills Columbia’s promise that the new campus would be open to the neighborhood and offer educational and other resources such as a health center and artistic events.

Analysis: Greitens’ aggressive style means in-party clashes
.B
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - While some Republican legislative leaders say they’re glad to work with Missouri GOP Gov. Eric Greitens to make top conservative priorities law, the new governor’s involved and sometimes aggressive leadership style has also meant intraparty clashes throughout the legislative session that ends May 12. Working with GOP allies, Greitens within weeks of his January inauguration signed a right-to-work bill banning mandatory union fees and he has been meeting one-on-one with some Republican lawmakers in order to get their shared pro-business and ethics priorities passed. But Greitens also has been quick to use social media to criticize fellow Republican lawmakers who disagree with him, angering some and leading to tension, particularly with the GOP-led Senate. The governor told The Associated Press he won’t “stand for any person who is going to put their own privileges ahead of the priorities of the people of Missouri.” “If some of the special interests, lobbyists (and) career politicians are angry with the fact that we’re willing to get things done and let people know that these things need to be addressed because lives are counting on it,” Greitens said, “then so be it.” Tensions boiled over in the Senate on Tuesday after a nonprofit that pushes the governor’s agenda launched attack ads against Sen. Rob Schaaf. The St. Joseph Republican had stalled a vote on a bill Greitens wants to create a Blue Alert system, similar to Amber Alerts, that would to notify people when a law enforcement officer is injured and the assailant is on the run. The nonprofit, called A New Missouri, advocates for Greitens and his agenda while accepting unlimited donations and without having to disclose who is making the contributions. Greitens has said he has no day-to-day involvement in the nonprofit, but senior adviser Austin Chambers told The Kansas City Star there is coordination among the governor’s office, the governor’s nonprofit and his campaign organization. Ads run by the nonprofit claimed Schaaf “is attempting to shut down all conservative action in the Senate because of personal political games that he is playing along with the liberals” and encouraged people to call Schaaf’s personal cellphone.  Schaaf in response said he wants to work on ethics bills, including legislation that targets the pro-Greitens nonprofit, by forcing such nonprofits to disclose donors. “We are not going to stand for this,” Schaaf said on the Senate floor. “Governor, I don’t care what your agenda is. My agenda is to do the work of the people.” Greitens’ at times rocky relationship with state lawmakers began before he started his term in January. The first-time elected official ran as an outsider and frequently criticized legislators as corrupt, career politicians. He vowed to clean up Jefferson City. Saint Louis University political scientist Ken Warren said while some Republican lawmakers have publicly dismissed that as water under the bridge, there’s likely still lingering resentment. “For a Republican who has a veto-proof Republican Legislature, he doesn’t have the best relationship with the state Legislature,” Warren said. “People are people and they don’t forget those things,” he added. “You just don’t say these ridiculous things about fellow Republicans, for instance, and then feel that they’re just going to forget it.” Greitens’ first clash as governor with Senate lawmakers came within weeks of his inauguration, when he sat down with some to pressure them to vote against a pay raise for themselves and other elected officials. Republican Sens. Denny Hoskins, of Warrensburg, and Paul Wieland, of Imperial - the only two Republicans who voted to allow the raise to take effect, although several others didn’t vote - said their meetings with the governor were tense. Greitens in turn took to Facebook to slam both senators, who he said complained that he “was a bit too rough with them.” He said he wouldn’t apologize. Another point of tension has been Greitens’ executive order to give paid family leave to state employees in his administration, a move that sidestepped the Legislature’s traditional responsibility for deciding how to spend the state’s money and frustrated some senators. Senators delayed confirming several of his appointments until he showed up to a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans to talk about the issue. Despite setbacks, Greitens and Republican lawmakers have been able to work together to make some major conservative policy goals into law. His signature on right-to-work represents a long-elusive victory for Missouri Republicans, who failed to achieve the change under former Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. Greitens has also signed legislation aimed at improving the state’s legal climate for businesses and is on board with a number of other Republican legislative goals to change labor laws. House Speaker Todd Richardson praised the newfound “ability to work with a like-minded administration,” and Senate Majority Leader Mike Kehoe said Greitens has been present at the Capitol and open to building relationships. But both acknowledged at least some lawmakers are not on the same page as Greitens. “Sometimes people just don’t mix,” Kehoe said. ___ Associated Press writer Katie Kull contributed to this report.

Tom Hanks on gifting coffee machines to White House reporters: ‘Those poor bastards need coffee’
.B
Tom Hanks has gifted coffee machines to the White House press corps three times since President George W. Bush took office, and the Academy Award-winning actor has a simple explanation why. “I’ve done that for Democrats and Republican administrations because those poor bastards need coffee,” Mr. Hanks told television host Stephen Colbert on Friday. “It’s as simple as that.” “I think this president might be keeping them up anyway,” Mr. Colbert responded. Mr. Hanks, 60, made his initial offering in 2004 after he toured the White House and was baffled by the absence of a decent coffeemaker inside the corps’ break room. He sent journalists an espresso machine soon afterwards, replacing it twice in the years since. “How is it holding up? Do you need another one?” Mr. Hanks asked reporters during a 2010 return to the White House amid former President Obama’s administration. “I’m going to get you another espresso machine…. Let me see what I can do for the poor slobs of the Fourth Estate here,” he said. He sent a replacement the following week and sent the latest edition to them in March this year along with a note reading: “To the White House Press Corps: Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice and the American Way. Especially for the Truth Part.” Three months into reporting on President Trump’s administration, the actor joked Friday that journalists currently covering the White House have their work cut out for them. “I have a feeling the problem now is there’s an awful lot of spit coffee on people’s laps,” Mr. Hanks said during Friday’s episode of the “Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on CBS.

Mexican man facing deportation gets extension in Mississippi

GREENWOOD, Miss. (AP) - A Mexican man who has lived in Mississippi the past 20 years says he has been given more time until facing possible deportation. Martin Duron-Esparza, 36, met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees Wednesday, Greenwood Commonwealth reported (http://bit.ly/2oR6AJx). Duron-Esparza immigrated to Leflore County as a 16yearold but never obtained documents for permanent residency. He said he received annual work permits for six years, but those ended last June, without explanation. ICE originally demanded that Duron-Esparza leave the U.S. by April 13. He was later told he could stay in Greenwood until his children finish this academic year at St. Francis School. He said ICE has set his possible departure date for June 1, but he is asking permission to stay another year. He and his wife, Elizabeth, have five children. The family attends St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, where he serves on the Parish Council. As part of his campaign for a stay, Duron-Esparza will offer documentation of taxes paid, school records and letters of goodwill from U.S. citizens. The letters would attest to character and good standing in the community. “The main thing is support from the community,” he said. “There are some people out there who know me and have some concern for my family. If we stay here, we will be good. We can stay here and be legal.” He has worked under contract on agricultural pivot irrigation systems, but this was disrupted after ICE agents sought him out. “I haven’t been able to work since all of this happened,” he said. “I haven’t had time.” He said he has been driving the couple’s children back and forth from school after an earlier encounter with immigration agents unnerved his wife. On April 10, she was returning from the school with children in their vehicle when ICE agents made an unannounced trip to Greenwood to arrest Duron-Esparza. She was detained on the street and made to telephone him for ICE. He was working near Vicksburg when he received the call. “She’s not wanting to get out of the house,” he said. “We spend the night taking turns looking out the window to make sure they don’t come.” In Pearl, he was presented with a less forceful side of ICE employees. He said he wants to thank them for working with him and described one of the agents who came to his house as a “human being” who is “doing his job.” ___ Information from: The Greenwood Commonwealth, http://www.gwcommonwealth.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

New high-tech firms flex political muscles in Massachusetts
.B
BOSTON (AP) - The high-tech whiz kids are starting to flex their political muscles on Beacon Hill, pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into lobbying aimed at appealing to state lawmakers and helping craft public policy. Last year, 77 high-tech companies spent about $5.4 million on lobbying - more than double the 48 companies that spent $2.4 million a decade ago, according to an Associated Press review of lobbyist reports filed with the state secretary’s office. The records not only offer a peak into the business of lobbying, but are another reminder of just how fast the pace of technology has accelerated. Three of the top four firms doling out the most on lobbying in 2016 didn’t even exist a decade ago. One of the top spenders was Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009 in San Francisco, which paid lobbyists nearly $330,000 to help get the transportation network company’s voice heard at the Statehouse. The spending coincides with efforts by state lawmakers to regulate ride-hailing companies. Last year, the state passed what Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the strongest-in-the-nation background checks for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft. Uber and Lyft embraced the new law. Chris Taylor, Uber’s Boston general manager, credited Baker and lawmakers at the time for “creating a framework that embraces an innovative industry that has changed the way the commonwealth moves.” The two companies then entered into an agreement with Baker to start the background checks a year earlier. About 8,200 drivers failed the checks. More than 62,000 passed. Some drive for both companies. While Baker later said up to 500 of those who failed had successfully appealed, Uber criticized the background checks as too strict. A representative of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Uber’s lobbying efforts. Another top spender was LevelUp, a Boston-based mobile payment app launched in 2011, which also spent about $300,000 on lobbying. According to the company’s lobbying report, the money was spent to support legislation targeting so-called “patent trolls” - companies that buy up patents and force businesses to pay license fees or face costly litigation. Specifically the company backed a bill designed to protect Massachusetts companies from what supporters call “abusive patent infringement claims.” A message left at the company’s headquarters wasn’t immediately returned. A third top spender was the Boston-based DraftKings, which spent nearly $159,000 on lobbying last year. According to the company’s report, the focus of that lobbying was the debate in Massachusetts over regulations of daily fantasy sports and online lottery products. A representative of the company declined to comment. The surge in lobbying by new high-tech companies - especially those that disrupt existing systems - shouldn’t come as a surprise, according to Mark Gallagher, a spokesman for the Massachusetts High Tech Council. “I think generally speaking there is a growing recognition in the tech community that public policy on a federal, state and local level can have a material impact on their companies,” Gallagher said. That’s particularly true when lawmakers are struggling to keep up with lightning-fast changes in the economy brought on by new technologies that might require a policy framework. “A decade ago, a lot of tech companies were focused more on their companies and less on an appreciation of the impact of policy,” Gallagher said. “That has changed.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

With closet cleaned at General Assembly, issues still remain
.B
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - If bills were clothing, then North Carolina lawmakers just finished setting out the few items they can see themselves wearing and sending the rest the attic. The Republican-controlled General Assembly just pushed past its biennial “crossover” deadline, as more than 200 bills cleared either the House or the Senate during the week. With exceptions, policy measures without specific taxes or spending that didn’t pass one chamber are probably dead through 2018. “We’ve sort of cleaned out the closet,” Senate leader Phil Berger of Eden said. The deadline points to the next phase of this year’s session, as well as hot-button issues Republicans will try to work out - and some that Democrats want to stop - before adjournment this summer. Final measures lacking GOP near-unanimity could get derailed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s vetoes. Here’s a look at some of those issues and what’s up next at the Legislative Building. IMMIGRATION The legislature in 2015 prohibited cities and counties from having “sanctuary” policies that ignore or avoid enforcing state or federal immigration laws. Although associations representing local governments maintain their members are complying, Republicans insist they need to go further to deter them. So the Senate approved on a party-line vote a measure punishing a government determined to be out of compliance by withholding tax dollars. The Senate measure goes beyond a similar House proposal by also threatening some University of North Carolina campuses with the loss of financial independence for noncompliance. The House meanwhile passed a bill allowing local residents to sue their city or county government over their lack of immigration enforcement. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES Lawmakers have put into play at least six proposed amendments to the state Constitution. They’re likely to be bargaining chips between House and Senate negotiators before deciding which get on the ballot in 2018. The House wants voters statewide to affirm longstanding “right-to-work” laws prohibiting union membership and paying dues as an employment requirement. The Senate has proposed reducing the constitutional cap on state income tax rates at 5.5 percent. Democrats oppose both questions. The House also has backed more referendum ideas for constitutional protections from land condemnations for private economic development, to expand the rights of crime victims and to limit governors from ever being elected more than twice. The current limit is simply two successive terms. Unlike other legislation, proposed constitutional amendments aren’t subject to Cooper’s veto stamp. ELECTIONS The Senate quickly pushed through many elections-related measures before the deadline. One proposal would make permanent shifting state and federal primaries from May to March - the 2016 primary was March 15 so North Carolina could influence presidential nominations. Another would reduce the number of signatures necessary to get unaffiliated and third-party candidates on the ballot. The threshold for a leading primary candidate to avoid a runoff also would fall from receiving more than 40 percent of the vote to 30 percent. The House and Senate also are weighing whether to overhaul odd-numbered municipal elections, such as by getting rid of their primary runoffs or moving these elections to even-numbered years. URBAN VS. RURAL North Carolina’s urban-rural divide was a key issue during the 2015 session and should play into House-Senate negotiations this year. The Senate passed bills capping job-creation grants the state can offer to corporations building in urban areas and redistributing a portion of sales taxes earmarked for local governments that could benefit many rural counties. The House has been less inclined to want to restrain high-growth and urban counties. WHAT’S NEXT Senate Republicans are finalizing a two-year state government budget proposal and aim to pass it through the chamber by May 11. The House wants to pass their own version by early June, setting the stage for negotiations for a final budget to present to Cooper before the new fiscal year begins July 1. Other topics on tap for debate include ending the practice of automatically prosecuting 16- and 17-year-olds charged with crimes as adults and tightening controls on prescription opioids. Narrowing local impact fees on new development and easing billboard restrictions also remain alive. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

(AP) - Organizers of a Hartford May Day rally say thousands of immigrants, top state officials and labor leaders are expected to gather at the state Capitol to call for an end to the Trump administration’s deportation policy and an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The “Here to Stay” immigrants’ rights rally is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Saturday. It’s among similar events in cities across the country over the weekend to mark May Day on May 1, a traditional day for workers’ rights demonstrations. Organizers say immigrants and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy will be among the speakers. Music and other entertainment are planned. Trump has aggressively pursued immigration enforcement, and the government has threatened to withhold funding from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Asian Olympic chief Sheikh Ahmad denies FIFA bribery claims
.B
GENEVA (AP) - Asian Olympic leader Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah of Kuwait has denied claims made in a U.S. federal court that he paid six-figure bribes to FIFA voters. “Sheikh Ahmad is very surprised by such allegations and strongly denies any wrongdoing,” the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said in a statement issued Saturday on behalf of its president. The sheikh’s influential roles in sports politics include the OCA presidency since 1991, a FIFA Council seat since 2015, and president of ANOC, the global group of national Olympic bodies, since 2012. He has been an International Olympic Committee member for a quarter of a century. Long seen as a key power broker in Olympic and soccer votes, Sheikh Ahmad is under pressure just nine days before he faces re-election for his own FIFA seat in a poll of Asian soccer federations. A FIFA panel which rules on candidates’ integrity is weighing whether to remove the Kuwaiti royal from the ballot paper in Manama, Bahrain. A person familiar with the process told The Associated Press that FIFA’s Review Committee began looking at Sheikh Ahmad’s case on Friday. The person requested anonymity because the process is confidential. The review started one day after a FIFA audit panel member admitted in a federal court in Brooklyn that he took $850,000 in bribes from Kuwaiti officials to buy his influence and help recruit other FIFA voters. A second FIFA judicial body, the FIFA ethics committee, can also take the sheikh out of the election by provisionally suspending him. Sheikh Ahmad has informed FIFA’s ethics investigators and “put himself at their disposal,” the IOC said in a statement Saturday. “And even though it is not related to any IOC matter he has also informed the IOC Chief Ethics and Compliance officer,” said Mark Adams, spokesman for IOC President Thomas Bach. Sheikh Ahmad was widely hailed as a “kingmaker” for his winning streak in Olympic elections. This week he became one of the highest profile sports officials drawn into the sprawling U.S. federal investigation of bribery and corruption soccer revealed two years ago. FIFA audit committee member Richard Lai, an American citizen from Guam, pleaded guilty on Thursday to wire fraud conspiracy charges related to bribes that helped officials gain influence in international soccer. Lai admitted receiving around $1 million in bribes from various Asian soccer leaders, including what the Department of Justice described as a “faction” from Kuwait seeking to gain influence in FIFA elections. Though Sheikh Ahmad was not named in Department of Justice and Brooklyn court documents, a transcript of Lai’s hearing quoted him as claiming “co-conspirator #2 was also the president of Olympic Council of Asia.” Co-conspirator #3 was described as having a “high-ranking” role at OCA, and also linked to the Kuwait soccer federation. According to the published transcript, Lai claimed he “received at least $770,000 in wire transfers from accounts associated with Co-Conspirator #3 and the OCA between November of 2009 and about the fall of 2014.” “I understood that the source of this money was ultimately Co-Conspirator #2 and on some occasion Co-Conspirator #3 told me to send him an email saying that I need funds so he could show the email to Co-Conspirator #2,” Lai said in court. The leader of Guam’s soccer federation for 16 years, Lai said he was approached by the Kuwaiti officials after a bitter Asian FIFA election in 2009. He agreed to help recruit other Asian officials that voted in FIFA elections who would help Kuwait’s interests. Lai “understood that at these meetings Co-Conspirator #3 or his assistants would offer or make bribe payments to these soccer officials,” the DoJ alleged. The Guam businessman also pleaded guilty to failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and agreed to pay more than $1.1 million in forfeiture and penalties. He was released on bail with a $1 million bond to return to Guam and will be sentenced at a later date. Lai was suspended for 90 days by the FIFA ethics committee, which is now reviewing Sheikh Ahmad’s case ahead of his candidacy for the May 8 election in Bahrain. The OCA said Sheikh Ahmad “will vigorously defend his integrity and reputation and that of any organization that he represents in any relevant legal review.” Sheikh Ahmad, who often works from the Olympic home city of Lausanne where ANOC has offices, seems to risk being arrested in Switzerland. Swiss authorities arrested nine FIFA officials in Zurich in two rounds of hotel raids in 2015 at the request of U.S. authorities. The American federal investigation of corruption linked to FIFA has indicted or taken guilty pleas from more than 40 people and marketing agencies linked to soccer in the Americas since 2015. Lai’s case marked the first major step into Asia, and his admission in court Thursday suggests other soccer officials potentially recruited by the Kuwait faction could be targeted by U.S. federal investigators.

North Dakota official faces recall threat for refugee claims
.B
FARGO, N.D. (AP) - A firebrand commissioner in Fargo wondered out loud during a council meeting last September how much money North Dakota’s largest city was spending on its decades-old refugee resettlement program, comments he has since backed up with speculation linking immigration to crime. Dave Piepkorn’s words have resonated for some, especially during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign when the Republican candidate promised to build a wall along America’s border with Mexico. But Piepkorn’s comments have also struck fear into Fargo’s diverse immigrant community, already concerned that the administration’s focus on blocking and deporting more refugees could tear families apart. “Fargo is a welcoming city and Dave Piepkorn is not supporting diversity,” said Abdiwali Sharif, a Somali refugee and an organizer of a drive to recall the commissioner. Piepkorn, 56 and a lifelong Fargo resident, has vowed to uncover “every penny” spent on resettlement, which he suspects is costing Fargo millions of dollars and he describes as an unfunded federal mandate. He says North Dakota should sue the government to reimburse resettlement costs. “It’s a lot of money going to a nonprofit. That troubles me,” Piepkorn said. Tax records show that Lutheran Social Services, which manages the program, received more than $11 million in federal grants in 2015, of which nearly $3.9 million went to refugee resettlement. But the group’s records indicate the only money it received directly from the city relating to refugees was $500 to support an annual conference. Shirley Dykshoorn, a vice president for the group, said the program’s funding is no secret and that she “would love to have any elected officials from the city, county or state come to our office for a question and answer exchange.” Fargo’s Human Relations Commission is investigating the cost of the program at the request of the City Commission. While it’s difficult to calculate the costs, the Human Relations Commission highlighted a National Academies of Science report in 2016 showing that on average, first-generation immigrants in North Dakota are cost-positive by $3,250 per individual. North Dakota’s resettlement program began in 1946, when the Lutheran Welfare Society - which became Lutheran Social Services - began accepting mostly Protestants fleeing Nazi Germany. The group has resettled an average of 450 refugees a year in the past decade, about 70 percent of whom wind up in Cass County, mostly in Fargo. Adnan Al Mashhadani, who arrived four months ago from Iraq with his wife and three children, said through an interpreter that he loves living in Fargo. He answered in English when asked whether he was sad to leave Iraq. “No. Very happy. Very happy,” he said. He said he hasn’t heard of Piepkorn. Local factories and Sanford Health, Fargo’s largest hospital, have hundreds of refugees on their payrolls and several immigrants have started their own companies, including Ned Halilovic, a Bosnian refugee who runs a cleaning service and last year became the first Muslim president of the Fargo Kiwanis Club. Piepkorn owns a lawn care franchise with 17 fulltime employees, none of whom are refugees. He says the refugees’ impact on the community is an important story, but not his to tell. “That’s not my job. My job is to see where we’re spending money,” he said. Piepkorn also wants to know whether refugees are responsible for more crime than other citizens. This question prompted the Human Relations Commission to issue a statement in January titled: “Crime Rates Not Higher in Refugee Populations.” The release quoted Fargo police saying the department has no hard numbers because immigration status is not routinely collected when someone enters the criminal justice system. The statement included only anecdotal information from the department’s cultural liaison officer. Piepkorn reveled in the report’s apparent contradiction. “That was fake news,” he declared. “The release said there were statistics and there weren’t any statistics.” Piepkorn’s detractors are quick to point to the commissioner’s own flubs with numbers. He said on a Fargo radio show that the Lutheran Social Services chief executive earns $350,000, which is more than double the true salary, and that the group spent $15 million on a new building when the facility cost about $5 million. First elected in 2008, Piepkorn was voted out in 2012 then restored to the commission in 2016. He appears unfazed by the recall effort, saying if he loses he will simply run again. He has declined to respond to rumors of mayoral aspirations. Piepkorn believes Lutheran Social Services is the driving force behind the recall effort, but Dykshoorn denies the organization is involved. Supporters must gather 3,500 signatures by May 12. Andrew Lenzmeier, 26, a restaurant manager and the chairman of the recall committee, said volunteers have received a “warm reception” from residents. The effort kicked off with nuns signing the petition. Piepkorn says a poll published in the Fargo Forum indicates a majority of residents approve of his efforts, and he believes he has the support of other political leaders, but declined to say who. “I will get support not just from the region. I will get support from all around the country,” Piepkorn said. State Democratic Sen. Tim Mathern, of Fargo, said he has no problem with Piepkorn asking about costs, but that he should also consider the long-term benefits of resettlement such as labor force growth, which boosts Fargo’s economy. “If his motivations are more sinister, then no data will make a difference,” Mathern said. Dykshorn said the U.S. has a long tradition of making people escaping horror and hardship feel welcome - and that should endure in Fargo. “Your and my ancestors were immigrants,” she said. “We can learn a lot by giving back, a hand up and a warm welcome.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump says China pressuring North Korea on missile, nukes
.B
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - President Donald Trump said in a television interview to be aired Sunday that he believes China’s president has been putting pressure on North Korea as it pursues its missile and nuclear weapons programs. In an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Trump said he won’t be happy if North Korea conducts a nuclear test and that he believes Chinese President Xi Jinping won’t be happy, either. Asked if that means military action, Trump responded: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.” On Saturday, a North Korean mid-range ballistic missile apparently failed shortly after launch, South Korea and the United States said, the third test-fire flop just this month but a clear message of defiance as a U.S. supercarrier conducts drills in nearby waters. North Korean ballistic missile tests are banned by the United Nations because they’re seen as part of the North’s push for a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland. The latest test came as U.S. officials pivoted from a hard line to diplomacy at the U.N. in an effort to address what may be Washington’s most pressing foreign policy challenge. North Korea didn’t immediately comment on the launch, though its state media on Saturday reiterated the country’s goal of being able to strike the continental U.S. The timing of the North’s test was striking: Only hours earlier the U.N. Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang’s escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers (44 miles) before it apparently failed. It didn’t immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew, but a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said it was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. It broke up a few minutes after the launch. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking after a meeting of Japan’s National Security Council, said the missile is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers (30 miles) and fallen on an inland part of North Korea. Analysts say the KN-17 is a new Scud-type missile developed by North Korea. The North fired the same type of missile April 16, just a day after a massive military parade where it showed off its expanding missile arsenal, but U.S. officials called that launch a failure. Some analysts say a missile the North test fired April 5, which U.S. officials identified as a Scud variant, also might have been a KN-17. U.S. officials said that missile spun out of control and crashed into the sea. Moon Seong Mook, a South Korean analyst and former military official, says that the North would gain valuable knowledge even from failed launches as it continues to improve its technologies for missiles. The South Korean and Japanese assessments about Saturday’s launch indicate that the North fired the missile from a higher-than-normal angle to prevent it from flying too far, he said. “They could be testing a variety of things, such as the thrust of the rocket engine or the separation of stages,” Moon said. “A failure is a failure, but that doesn’t mean the launch was meaningless.” The two earlier launches were conducted from an eastern coastal area, but Saturday’s missile was fired in the west, from an area near Pukchang, just north of the capital, Pyongyang. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry denounced the launch as an “obvious” violation of United Nations resolutions and the latest display of North Korea’s “belligerence and recklessness.” “We sternly warn that the North Korean government will continue to face a variety of strong punitive measures issued by the U.N. Security Council and others if it continues to reject denuclearization and play with fire in front of the world,” the ministry said. Pope Francis warned that “a good part of humanity” will be destroyed if tensions with North Korea escalate, and he called for diplomacy and a revived United Nations to take the lead in negotiating a resolution. Francis was asked as he traveled back to Rome from Egypt on Saturday local time (early Sunday morning Seoul time) about North Korean ballistic missile tests and U.S. warnings of “catastrophic” consequences if the world fails to stop them. “Today, a wider war will destroy not a small part of humanity, but a good part of humanity and culture. Everything. Everything, no? It would be terrible. I don’t think humanity today could bear it,” he told reporters The North routinely test-fires a variety of ballistic missiles, despite U.N. prohibitions, as part of its weapons development. While shorter-range missiles are somewhat routine, there is strong outside worry about each longer-range North Korean ballistic test. Saturday’s launch comes at a point of particularly high tension. Trump has sent a nuclear-powered submarine and the USS Carl Vinson aircraft supercarrier to Korean waters, and North Korea this week conducted large-scale, live-fire exercises on its eastern coast. The U.S. and South Korea also started installing a missile defense system that is supposed to be partially operational within days, while their two navies began joint military drills later Saturday. The South Korean navy said the drills are aimed at “deterring North Korea’s provocations and displaying the firm alliance between the United States and South Korea.” On Friday, the United States and China offered starkly different strategies for addressing North Korea’s escalating nuclear threat as Tillerson demanded full enforcement of economic sanctions on Pyongyang and urged new penalties. Stepping back from suggestions of U.S. military action, he even offered aid to North Korea if it ends its nuclear weapons program. The range of Tillerson’s suggestions, which over a span of 24 hours also included restarting negotiations, reflected America’s failure to halt North Korea’s nuclear advances despite decades of U.S.-led sanctions, military threats and stop-and-go rounds of diplomatic engagement. As the North approaches the capability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, the Trump administration feels it is running out of time. Chairing a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Tillerson declared that “failing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences.” His ideas included a ban on North Korean coal imports and preventing its overseas guest laborers, a critical source of government revenue, from sending money home. And he warned of unilateral U.S. moves against international firms conducting banned business with Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, which could ensnare banks in China, the North’s primary trade partner. Yet illustrating the international gulf over how best to tackle North Korea, several foreign ministers on the 15-member council expressed fears of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which was divided between the American-backed South and communist North even before the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended with no formal peace treaty. And while danger always has lurked, tensions have escalated dramatically as the North’s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has expanded a nuclear arsenal his government says is needed to avert a U.S. invasion. No voice at Friday’s session was more important than that of China, a conduit for 90 percent of North Korea’s commerce and a country Trump is pinning hopes on for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear crisis. Trump, who recently hosted President Xi Jinping for a Florida summit, has sometimes praised the Chinese leader for a newfound cooperation to crack down on North Korea and sometimes threatened a go-it-alone U.S. approach if Xi fails to deliver. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China would adhere to past U.N. resolutions and wants a denuclearized peninsula. But he spelled out no further punitive steps his government might consider, despite Tillerson’s assertions in an interview hours ahead of the council meeting that Beijing would impose sanctions of its own if North Korea conducts another nuclear test. Wang put forward a familiar Chinese idea to ease tensions: North Korea suspending its nuclear and missile activities if the U.S. and South Korea stop military exercises in the region. Washington and Seoul reject the idea. Tillerson said the U.S. does not seek regime change in North Korea, and he signaled American openness to holding direct negotiations with Pyongyang. The U.S. also could resume aid to North Korea once it “begins to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile technology programs,” he said. Since 1995, he added, Washington has provided more than $1.3 billion to the impoverished country. But the prospects for any more U.S. money going there appeared bleak. Even negotiations don’t seem likely. Tillerson said the North must take “concrete steps” to reduce its weapons threat before talks could occur. Six-nation nuclear negotiations with North Korea stalled in 2009. The Obama administration sought to resurrect them in 2012, but a deal to provide food aid in exchange for a nuclear freeze soon collapsed. “In a nutshell, (North Korea) has already declared not to attend any type of talks which would discuss its nuclear abandonment, nuclear disbandment,” Kim In Ryong, North Korea’s deputy U.N. ambassador, told The Associated Press. His government declined to attend Friday’s council meeting. ___ AP writers Matthew Pennington and Lolita C. Baldor in Washington and Edith Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this story.

People’s Climate March — rally of the ridiculous
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Let the marching begin. On the heels of the March for Science — which really ought to have been called the March Against Science — now come the People’s Climate March people. And boy, are they ready to engage. Their motto, according to a video posted on their Facebook event page? “People’s Climate March: We resist. We build. We rise.” Well and good. What exactly they’re building up and rising from are largely unknowns — but as the for the resisting part, that’s clear. “[Saturday] is the 100th day of Trump’s Presidency,” People’s Climate Movement wrote, again on Facebook. “Join us as we bring the resistance back to his doorstep.” Forgive the yawns. It’s just that after 100 days of anti-President Donald Trump protesting, which came on the heels of 200 or so days of anti-Candidate Donald Trump protesting, the Hate Trump message is getting a bit stale. Perhaps protesters ought to shake it up a bit — try a more creative approach. For instance, instead of saying “Impeach Trump,” say “el process de destitucion Trump,” a Spanish language equivalent (or so the site Spanishdict.com tells me). Nobody will know what you’re talking about — except Spanish-speakers in the crowd, which, on second thought, means probably everybody will know what you’re talking about. In any effect, it’ll give pause. Imagine the scene — everybody yelling and hollering “impeach Trump! impeach Trump!” and then, out of the blue, like a lone voice in the wilderness: “El process de destitucion!” People will be like, whaa? And then they’ll clamor for more — ‘cause new is cool, you know. Think of the T-shirt sales to be had. But if you really want to grab some attention? Try the Russian word for impeach. It’s impossible to type on an English-only keyboard, but somebody out there in People’s Climate March land must know the translation. That’d be funny as anything, hearing some Russian screaming “impeach Trump” in the tongue of the motherland. Everybody would be wondering what happened to all the campaign love — To Trump, From Your Bestie, Putin. Make ‘em think; that’s the key. Much better than making them yawn, yes? So marchers — yes, by all means, march. Fill the streets with protests and cast-off hats made of bean stalks or roadkill skins, or whatever the going green movement material of the day happens to be. The environment’s in peril, climate change is a-comin’, and Trump — good Lord, man, Trump! — is still in the White House. Much to be done, it seems. But how about this time getting a little more creative with the protesting? Think of the watchers. You’ve got an audience to entertain. And the old standbys, “impeach Trump,” “down with Trump,” “get Trump,” just aren’t grabbing the attention any more. After all, it’s one thing to be ridiculous. But it’s another thing entirely to be ridiculous and boring. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

‘Pravda Act’ passes first hurdle; bill would add Russian election meddling to California curriculum
.B
Russia’s involvement in last year’s U.S. presidential race is one step closer to being taught in California high schools upon the advancement Wednesday of a state lawmaker’s so-called “Pravda Act.” California Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat, first introduced the bill back in February to ensure high schoolers in the state are properly taught about last year’s White House contest, particularly with respect to the Russian government’s reported role in influencing its outcome. The proposal cleared its first major legislative hurdle this week after passing the Assembly Education Committee by a 4-1 vote Wednesday, effectively sending the bill to the legislature’s Appropriations Committee for further consideration. If approved by the full legislature and signed into law, Assembly Bill 838 will require high schools in California to incorporate Russia’s election meddling into future curriculum. “The 2016 presidential election was unlike any other in American history,” Mr. Levine said, Courthouse News reported Wednesday. “We must ensure students in California are aware of actual and potential threats of hostile foreign governments’ attempts to influence their thoughts and opinions about our nation’s leaders.” The Russian government oversaw an influence campaign last year that sought to interfere in November’s White House election and hinder the chances of former Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton with the aid of state-sponsored hackers and an international propaganda apparatus, according to the U.S. intelligence community. Moscow has denied the allegations. While the operation remains the subject of no fewer than three federal investigations, however, Mr. Levine said students nonetheless need to be properly educated on the historic election. “We considered how many things the Legislature has weighed in on, like President Obama being elected, or environmental education, or the Chinese Exclusion Act,” the assemblyman said, according to Courthouse News. “I think this takes a much less intrusive role in education for our students than those other important things we did weigh in on.” “Usually, winners write the history books, but we have an obligation to teach the truth. On a daily basis, President Trump engages in a misinformation campaign and repeatedly lies to the public,” Mr. Levine said previously. “In this case, it is important for history to reflect the facts. We must make sure students in California and across the United States receive accurate information about the 2016 Presidential election.” California Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, a Republican, cast the lone dissenting vote Wednesday, Courthouse News reported. Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, a Democrat, abstained from voting. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Methodist church court rules against openly lesbian bishop
.B
NEW YORK (AP) — The first openly lesbian bishop in the United Methodist Church can stay on the job for now, but she is subject to a disciplinary review that could lead to her removal, the top church court ruled Friday. Bishop Karen Oliveto’s civil marriage to another woman violates church law that bars clergy who are “self-avowed practicing homosexuals,” the Judicial Council said. However, a decision over whether she can remain in the position must come from a separate disciplinary process, the court ruled. Oliveto was elected last year to lead a Denver-area church region that is part of the Methodist Western Jurisdiction, which has rejected the denomination’s position that “the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.” Within minutes of her election, a challenge was filed by the Oklahoma-based South Central Jurisdiction, leading to Friday’s ruling. The case is the latest chapter in an intensifying fight over LGBT recognition that is fracturing the 12.8 million-member denomination - the third-largest faith group in the U.S. Earlier this week, bishops announced a special 2019 meeting of its top legislative body, or General Conference, expressly to address church law on sexuality and find ways the denomination can avoid schism. LGBT advocates in the church have stepped up pressure to lift prohibitions on gay clergy. Bishops have conducted same-sex weddings in defiance of church policy and dozens of LGBT clergy have come out, risking being defrocked. Evangelical Methodists, who have gained strength in the denomination in part through growth of Methodist churches overseas, have responded by pushing to enforce church policies. The court said Friday that bishops who consecrate an openly gay bishop were considered in violation of Methodist law and also subject to church discipline. The Methodist policy making body has upheld the church’s stand on same-sex relationships since 1972, even as other mainline Protestant groups, including the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), have approved same-sex marriage. The ruling Friday was made on a 6-3 vote. Oliveto said she felt “grateful” for the chance to remain as bishop as she and other church leaders study what the decision means for her future. Bruce Ough, president of the Methodist Council of Bishops, said the decision would not ease “the disagreements, impatience and anxiety” in the church, but he appealed to church members to stay unified.

For honor: WWII commemoration event to be held at Omni Bedford Springs Resort
.B
Central Pennsylvania’s Omni Bedford Springs Resort will host a WWII Weekend Saturday and Sunday aimed at honoring veterans of America’s greatest war — and as a way to honor the resort’s own small part in the conflicted that ended 72 years ago. The Omni, now a luxury resort in Bedford, Pennsylvania, was utilized by the U.S. Navy as part of the war effort between 1942 and 1945, including for its Radio “A” School. In addition to being used for training, Japanese diplomatic personnel were kept at the property during the war. The Omni is bringing Members of BCARS (Bedford County Amateur Radio Society) to interact with guests and perform radio demonstrations. Additionally, the Omni will feature exhibits such as vintage radio equipment, Navy artifacts and other memorabilia from the 1940s. Re-enactors will be on hand, and the exhibits will feature historical documents, photographs and other guest speakers. The 1942 wartime classic film “Casablanca,” starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, will be screened. For information on the weekend’s program, visit Omni-Hotels.com.

‘Pravda Act’ seeks to add Russia’s alleged election meddling to California school curriculums
.B
The Intelligence community’s conclusion the Russian government meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election may soon be taught in California schools if a Democratic state assemblyman has his say. Assembly member Marc Levine of California’s 10th District plans to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that would require the state to educate students with respect to what the U.S. intelligence community has described as a Kremlin-directed influence campaign aimed at getting Donald Trump elected president. “Students need to understand how [President] Trump’s policies are colored by the way he rose to power,” Mr. Levine, 42, told The Hill on Monday. “We have a duty to history to make it remember the Kremlin’s decision to hand pick a candidate,” said the Marin County lawmaker. The U.S. intelligence community did not conclude the Russian involvement impacted the outcome of the election. Previewing his proposal in a statement last week, Mr. Levine said his bill would direct the State Board of Education “to develop curriculum to educate California students about Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” “California is the largest textbook market in the nation. Textbooks approved in our state are used throughout the country. Through this legislation, we can make sure students in California and across the United States receive accurate information about the 2016 Presidential election,” he said. “It’s been said the winners write the history books, and we’ve already heard President-elect Trump talk about his landslide victory, which is certainly not the case,” Mr. Levinetold the Petaluma Press Democrat on Monday. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded with “high confidence” that “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the likes of which involved compromising the email accounts of various Democratic officials through Moscow-sanctioned hacking campaigns and then supplying their stolen correspondence to websites including WikiLeaks. According to Mr. Levine, the findings are worthy of being brought to light in California classrooms alongside other events of historical importance. “The work of 17 intelligence agencies including the FBI and CIA confirmed Russian interference in our election. This is a threat to our democracy and must be treated with appropriate significance in American history,” he said. Mr. Levine said his bill will be called the Pravda Act of 2017, a reference to the Russian word for “truth” as well as the Soviet-era propaganda outlet that continues to tow the Kremlin line. Another California lawmaker, meanwhile, wants educators to begin devoting class time toward a different topic that dominated last year’s election cycle: fake news. Democratic State Senator Bill Dodd of Napa proposed legislation of his own this month that would direct the Board of Education to ensure media literacy is incorporated into school curriculums. “The rise of fake and misleading news is deeply concerning. Even more concerning is the lack of education provided to ensure that people can distinguish what is fact and what’s not,” Mr. Dodd said in a statement. “Through new technology, news has never been more readily available. However, the quality of that information varies widely. By giving students the proper tools to analyze the media they consume, we can empower them to make informed decisions.” Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied Russia used hacking or other tactics to interfere in last year’s White House race. Although Mr. Trump has been skeptical of the intelligence community’s findings, he said earlier this month he believes Russia hacked various U.S. targets in the run-up to his election.

Marijuana dispute on 4/20 blamed for double murder in New Mexico
.B
A marijuana dispute resulted in a double homicide on April 20, pot enthusiasts’ unofficial holiday, police said Thursday. The Clovis Police Department in New Mexico announced their findings Thursday, April 27, exactly one week after detectives began investigating the deaths of David “Bo Bo” Lopez, 43, and Carlos Gallegos, 25. Authorities determined the two men killed each other while arguing over weed, KOB-TV reported Friday. The altercation began early on the morning of April 20 and ultimately escalated from a fight over marijuana to a double homicide, according to police. Law enforcement received a 9-1-1 call shortly after 4 a.m. that morning from an individual who said a person had been shot at an apartment in Clovis, about 200 miles east of Albuquerque near the Texas border. Emergency personnel found Lopez unresponsive at the scene and later determined he died from severe organ damage after a single gunshot to the buttocks. Gallegos, meanwhile, was discovered in the driver’s seat of an automobile not far from the crime scene dead from a knife wound to the neck. Lopez stabbed Gallegos in the neck during the dispute, police believe. Gallegos left the apartment moments later, according to authorities, only to return with a pistol and open fire. Detectives ultimately found a knife in Lopez’s pocket and a gun in Gallegos‘ truck, KOB-TV reported. No other individuals are believed involved. The weed-related double homicide happened as marijuana enthusiasts across the world celebrated April 20, or 4/20 — an informal weed holiday widely associated with stoner culture.

BOSTON (AP) — Organizers of a rally planned for Boston Common say they’re marking President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office by protesting his agenda so far. The rally Saturday will focus on what protesters say are Trump’s efforts to roll back protections for the climate; his assaults on air, water and land; and his attacks on working families, indigenous peoples, people of color, immigrants, the LGBT community, women, young people and low-income communities. The rally is planned for noon on the common. Organizers include unions, local community groups, environmental groups, and religious and faith leaders. Similar rallies are planned in cities and communities across the country. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Portland men accused of sex trafficking teen girl

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Two men have been arrested after police say they were sex trafficking a 16-year-old girl. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports 22-year-old Tre Jenkins and 20-year-old Antonio Moore were arrested Thursday at Moore’s southeast Portland apartment after an investigation that included Beaverton police and the FBI. The girl has been reunited with her family. Court records say Jenkins and Moore are accused of compelling prostitution, promoting prostitution and evidence tampering. Moore is also accused of sexual abuse. Police say they tracked the girl to Moore’s apartment and got her out. Police say Jenkins and Moore initially refused to come out of the apartment, but then surrendered. It’s not clear from court documents how the girl met the two men. Court papers described Jenkins and Moore as foster brothers. ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

NSA scales back warrantless collection of emails, internet communications
.B
The National Security Agency will stop using a controversial form of warrantless surveillance that collects Americans’ communications with those outside the United States based on the mention of a foreign surveillance target. The decision was announced Friday and followed an evaluation prompted by “compliance lapses,” according to a statement issued by the NSA. As part of the decision the agency will also delete most of the previously intercepted communications collected under its Upstream surveillance program. “NSA will no longer collect certain internet communications that merely mention a foreign intelligence target,” read a statement issued Friday by the agency. “Instead, NSA will limit such collection to internet communications that are sent directly to or from a foreign target.” The change in policy concerns the NSA’s collection of international internet communications — including emails, web-browsing traffic, and other messages — as authorized under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. Under the Upstream program, Americans communications with people outside the U.S. could be stored and read if they are “to, from, or about” an approved “selector.” Selectors can include email addresses or phone numbers of foreign targets. Under the change, only communications that are directly to or from those “selectors” can still be surveilled. The last disclosure of Section 702 surveillance data showed that in 2015, more than 94,000 foreign people, groups or entities outside the United States were targeted for surveillance. The intelligence community has argued that such surveillance is needed to collect information on terrorist plots and other threats. The change in policy comes after the NSA said it conducted an in-house review of Section 702 activities and “discovered several inadvertent compliance lapses” that involved queries of Americans. Those lapses were reported to Congress and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. After the reports, the NSA devised a plan to resolve the issue. The FISA court recently approved the plan and the surveillance changes, the NSA said. Rep. Adam Schiff,  the Ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the NSA’s decision was “a sound response to the technological challenges of the program and the unintended collection of certain U.S. person information.” “Going forward, I will continue to expect strict compliance with the FISA Court orders and will push for Section 702’s reauthorization along with any additional reforms needed to further strengthen and institutionalize protections for privacy and transparency,” the California Democrat said. Section 702 of the FISA Amendment Act is set to expire at the end of the year if Congress does not reauthorize it. Privacy and civil liberties advocates, who have argued for reforms since the programs were revealed through leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, applauded the change. But they said future reforms of the program are still needed. “The content of our emails and texts contains incredibly personal information about our work, our families, and our most intimate thoughts. The NSA should never have been vacuuming up all of these communications, many of which involved Americans, without a warrant,” said Michelle Richardson, deputy director of the Freedom, Security, and Technology Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “While we welcome the voluntary stopping of this practice, it’s clear that Section 702 must be reformed so that the government cannot collect this information in the future.” Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the warrantless surveillance of Americans will still be allowed to continue under the auspices of Section 702 of FISA and that Congress should step in to further reform the law. “While the NSA’s policy change will curb some of the most egregious abuses under the statute, it is at best a partial fix,” she said. “Congress should take steps to ensure such practices are never resurrected and end policies that permit broad, warrantless surveillance under Section 702, which is up for reauthorization at the end of the year.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Machete-wielding man asked political affiliation before Transylvania University attack: Witnesses
.B
A 19-year-old former Transylvania University student has been arrested after a machete attack on the central Kentucky campus left a woman injured, police said. Lexington police said Mitchell W. Adkins, of Cincinnati, walked into Jazzman’s Cafe on campus armed with a machete and a bag full of knives shortly before 9 a.m. Friday. Police said he pulled out the machete and attacked a female student, who was sent to University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening, a local NBC affiliate reported. Another female was reportedly treated by paramedics on scene. Tristan Reynolds, who witnessed the attack, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that about 30 to 40 people were in the cafe at the time. “A guy came in, banged something, a hatchet or an ax, on the table and said ‘the day of reckoning has come,’” Mr. Reynolds said. “He asked somebody what their political affiliation was, they said ‘Republican’ and the guy said ‘you are safe.’ And then I realized what was going on and started getting people out.” “We started to scatter and then very, very quickly, campus security was getting everybody sheltered and secure,” he said. “They were very on it.” Another witness, Michael Soder, told NBC: “He asked the first girl if she was a Democrat or a Republican. She said Republican. He said OK, then asked some other girl. … By that time, some of my friends were running out and yelling for us to leave.” Campus security officers subdued the assailant quickly, Lexington Police Chief Mark Barnard said. The university was placed on a cautionary lockdown following the attack and classes were canceled for the rest of the day. Mr. Adkins has been charged with first-degree assault, fourth-degree assault and three counts of wanton endangerment, the Herald-Leader reported. Mr. Adkins was taken to a hospital to be evaluated for “self-inflicted injuries,” police said. Transylvania President Seamus Carey praised campus security officers for their quick action, the Herald-Leader reported. “They’ve always been amazing, and today they proved their worth again,” Mr. Carey said. “They were there immediately. They saved what could have been a much more disastrous situation, and I’d also like to commend the Lexington police for responding immediately as well.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke may soon have himself a new job in President Donald Trump’s administration. Multiple sources with knowledge of the White House’s plans for filling a Department of Homeland Security spot at the Office of Partnership and Engagement told Politico on Friday that Mr. Clarke is a viable contender. “[It’s] not a done deal yet,” a senior administration official told the website of its vetting process. Mr. Clarke gained national fame in recent years with appearances on Fox News Channel discussing the rule of law, the Black Lives Matter movement and former President Barack Obama’s rhetoric on racial issues. He also spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention. “We simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, and in our schools,” the lawman said July 18, 2016. “I see this every day, at street level, where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times. This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, and lifestyle. …” “Donald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a re-commitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington; no private citizen, no elected official, even Hillary Clinton; and no group of people, despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances, can claim privilege above the law,” the sheriff continued. “It cannot happen in the United States.” A DHS spokesman and Mr. Clarke both declined to comment for Politico’s story.

Sessions: Secure borders, recruitment prevention key to fighting gangs
.B
Secure borders and efforts to deter gang recruitment will be key to the Justice Department’s strategy to reduce gang violence like that wrought by MS-13, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday during a visit to Long Island, New York. Gang members’ ability to sneak across the border and to entice new recruits once they enter the United States are undermining efforts to keep communities safe, said the attorney general, highlighting the MS-13 gang-related homicides that had recently occurred in the Central Islip area he visited. “We cannot continue with this transporting across out border, illegal immigrants who have not been properly vetted and actually are part of criminal organizations,” Mr. Sessions said. “This is a fundamental requirement of a lawful society.” Authorities believe that at least 11 homicides in the Central Islip and nearby Brentwood communities that have occurred since August 2016 are gang-related — including four young men found brutally slain in a local park this month. Mr. Sessions lamented the fact that gang members have sought to exploit the immigration system, with members allowed into the United States as unaccompanied minors. Under then-President Barack Obama’s policies, unaccompanied minors caught by immigration authorities were not sent back across the border, but rather are shuttled among various federal agencies until they are eventually delivered to their parents, other relatives or sponsor families in the U.S. “If they come as undocumented minors, the federal government transports them wherever in the interior they say they’d like to go,” Mr. Sessions said Friday. “The bad guys know how this system works, and they have exploited it.” Improving security of the U.S.-Mexico border and dismantling the human smuggling rings that transport people illegally across is essential to long-term efforts decrease crime committed by criminal organizations, the attorney general said. “If we don’t do this, their leadership will simply send new emissaries and recruiters back to the United States to replace the ones we take off the streets,” Mr. Sessions said. But another issue confronted by law enforcement is the recruitment of young people into criminal gangs. Gang experts note that recent immigrants are often targeted by gangs for recruitment. “We know that gangs aren’t content to simply ruin the lives of adults — they recruit in our high schools, our middle schools and even our elementary schools. They recruit unaccompanied minors coming into this country,” Mr. Sessions said. He stressed that efforts to educate young people and their families about gangs and prevention efforts is critical. “We must do more to send a clear message to our young people: For the sake of your lives and your futures, stay away from gangs, drugs and violent crime,” Mr. Sessions said.

NRA’s Wayne LaPierre: Academic, political, media elites ‘America’s greatest domestic threats’

ATLANTA — Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, on Friday told gun-rights activists they have to do their best to support President Trump because “leftist zealots” and elites are determined to tear him down. “We must do all we can to support our president, because as you know, there’s an intense war that’s being waged by leftist zealots to destroy President Trump and destroy his administration,” Mr. LaPierre said. “It’s up to us to speak up against the three most dangerous voices in America: academic elites, political elites, and media elites,” he said. “These are America’s greatest domestic threats.” Mr. LaPierre called Sen. Bernard Sanders a “political predator of young voters who were lied to by school teachers and college professors.” Mr. LaPierre was speaking at the 2017 NRA Institute for Legislative Action’s “Leadership Forum” at the gun-rights group’s annual meetings, held this year in Atlanta.

Court halts case on Clean Power Plan, paves way for dismantling of carbon emissions rule
.B
In a major victory for the White House, the D.C. Court of Appeals on Friday suspended a case on the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, paving the way for the administration to dismantle the rule without interference from the courts. President and Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt want to formally undo the plan, which would’ve set the first national limits on carbon emissions from power plants. The proposal was a cornerstone of former President Obama’s environmental agenda. After lawsuits from energy companies and Republican state officials, including Mr. Pruitt, the plan was stayed by a federal court last year. The D.C. court was expected to soon rule on whether the proposal violated the federal Clean Air Act, which had been the chief legal argument against the proposal. Friday’s decision removes the possibility that a court could step in and declare the plan perfectly lawful even as the administration begins undoing it. Such a scenario would’ve been politically embarrassing for the EPA and would’ve represented a significant win for environmental activists. Now, without court interference, it looks as if the Clean Power Plan is destined for the ash heap. “Today’s decision by the court is a positive step toward protecting West Virginia coal miners and those who depend upon their success,” said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, one of the Republican officials who challenged the plan in court. “The court recognized the landscape has changed and that a decision on the merits is not appropriate at this time.” But environmentalists contend that the plan is legally sound, and that ultimately federal courts will force the EPA to fulfill its duty to regulate harmful emissions. “The fact is that the Clean Power Plan remains on strong legal footing, with readily achievable emissions reduction targets toward which our nation is already making major strides to save lives and protect the health of the public,” said Joanne Spalding, chief counsel for the Sierra Club. “This progress can’t be turned around as clean energy is growing cheaper and more accessible.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Christie’s successor will face transportation tests
.B
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey’s next governor stands to inherit a still-stalled plan to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, a transit system racked by recent maintenance and safety issues, and a driving public unhappy about gas tax increases. The issues were highlighted this week after Amtrak announced repair work at New York’s Penn Station that would stretch rail delays into the summer and after state transportation officials hailed an eight-year funding plan financed by a gas tax hike during a hearing before New Jersey’s Democrat-led Legislature. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states with governor races this year. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who is term limited and can’t seek re-election, has remained on the defensive over his 2010 decision to scrap a trans-Hudson rail project. That project’s successor, called Gateway, has broad support but an uncertain funding source. But Christie has gone on the offense against Amtrak and all but declared victory, saying that Amtrak’s plans to repair tracks satisfied his demands that the railway certify its tracks before the state resumes making nearly $200 million monthly maintenance payments. Christie’s ultimatum came after recent derailments at the station. ___ THE ISSUE New Jersey is home to a critical course along the Northeast Corridor, connecting New York and Philadelphia by rail and road. Among the biggest issues is the fate of a more than $20 billion project to build new rail connections beneath the Hudson River to replace the nearly 110-year-old tunnels. But funding under Republican President Donald Trump’s proposed budget is in question. A related question concerns New Jersey Transit, which is in the midst of installing so-called positive train control systems, and has faced heightened scrutiny since it had more accidents and paid more in safety fines over five years, according to federal data. Drivers in New Jersey are also paying more at the pump thanks to an unpopular 23-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase enacted under Christie. The 2016 deal resulted in a transportation trust fund program that when combined with federal funds secures $32 billion over eight years. But the deal also included tax cuts, called for by Christie, that would leave the next governor with estimated budget holes to fill. ___ CANDIDATE POSITIONS AND PROMISES Democratic front-runner Phil Murphy is calling for increased state assistance for New Jersey Transit, and said through a spokesman that a growing economy would pay for it and he would require “the wealthiest among us and large corporations to pay their fair share.” He has also said he would “fight for every federal dollar,” a reference to New Jersey’s near-the-bottom ranking in federal aid dollars. Among his three fellow Democrats and governor-hopefuls, Jim Johnson, a lawyer, unveiled a seven-point plan on transportation, including increasing funding and building the Gateway tunnel. State Sen. Ray Lesniak opposed Christie’s and the Legislature’s transportation plan and gas tax hike. Instead, he called for phasing an increase in over time. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chairs the Assembly transportation committee and like Lesniak opposed the transportation trust fund legislation, favors a 30-year plan that also would have phased in the gas tax increase. He also called for spending more on NJ Transit. Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno also criticized the gas tax increase and has called for scrapping a four-person board that the 2016 deal signed by Christie established to approve capital projects. She also backs the Gateway project. Fellow Republican and Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli said the NJ Transit maintenance and safety issues concerned him so much that the $2 billion transportation trust fund should be used for the rail agency until service disruptions improve. ___ WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY Vincent Pellecchia, associate director of the nonprofit Tri-State Transportation Campaign that covers Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, is raising warning flags about how the federal and state governments prioritize funding for transportation. He said recently, “The inability to prioritize is real and so are its effects: bad subway service, even worse bus service, broken rails, derailments, extensive delays, lack of redundancy and, ultimately, a threat to the engines of the economy.” ___ This is the seventh in a weekly series that will look at issues facing New Jersey ahead of the June 6 primary.

Assad blasts Trump’s foreign policy after airstrike on Syria suggests about-face
.B
President Trump has abandoned campaign trail promises and other pre-inaugural pledges in lieu of letting special interests shape his administration’s foreign policy agenda, Syrian President Bashar Assad said this week. “As we have seen in the past few weeks, he changed his rhetoric completely and subjected himself to the terms of the deep American state, or the deep American regime,” Mr. Assad said of his American counterpart in an interview released Thursday by teleSUR. Mr. Trump “has no policies” and has instead sought guidance from “the intelligence agencies, the Pentagon, the big arms manufacturers, oil companies, and financial institutions,” the Syrian leader said. “That’s why it is unrealistic and a complete waste of time to make an assessment of the American president’s foreign policy, for he might say something, but he ultimately does what these institutions dictate to him,” Mr. Assadsaid. “This is not new. This has been ongoing American policy for decades.” Despite vowing to pursue a non-interventionalist agenda if elected president, Mr. Trump authorized the U.S. military to strike a Syrian airbase this month after American officials determined it was used by the Assad regime to launch a recent chemical weapons attack. Weeks before being elected, Mr. Trump said: “We cannot be the policeman  of the world, we cannot protect countries all over the world, where  they’re not paying us what we need.” He called Mr. Assad “a butcher”  after this month’s chemical weapons attack, however, and authorized the  Pentagon to fire 59 missiles at an airfield operated by the Syrian  government. Mr. Assad has denied responsibility, however, and has describe the chemical weapons attack as “fabricated” and “unconvincing,” contrary to evidence indicting it claimed dozens of victims, including women and children. “This is what characterizes American politicians: they lie on a daily basis,” Mr. Assad told teleSUR this week. “That’s why we shouldn’t believe what the Pentagon or any other American institution says because they say things which serve their policies, not things which reflect reality and the facts on the ground.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

A Churchill quote on U.K.’s new 5-pound note is stirring controversy: Report
.B
It seems missing quotation marks on the new £5 note being introduced in the United Kingdom has caused some Britons to complain about Her Majesty’s Government not upholding the high standards of the Queen’s English, the Daily Telegraph reported Friday. In its original concept art, the Bank of England previewed the new currency featuring Sir Winston Churchill with one of his famous lines from the darkest hours of World War II — “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.” — appearing under his portrait. But the final version entering circulation, the Telegraph notes, lacks both a period at the end of the sentence and quotation marks, two strikes against the new fiver in the eyes of the National Literacy Trust, the London newspaper explained. “We are living in a post-punctuation world created by big institutions. Some people may dismiss omissions as pedantry, but they have lost sight of the fact that precision of expression reflects precision of thought,” complained the University of Buckingham’s Alan Smithers, the Telegraph reported. An English lecturer at the University of Oxford, Tara Stubbs, agreed the omission was “condescending” and lamented a third but perhaps more controversial transgression. “It also doesn’t have the Oxford comma after ‘tears.’ To take that stuff out is condescending and I find efforts to dumb down like this just irritating,” she said. Of course, other experts consulted by the Telegraph disagreed, finding the whole row to be a tempest in a teapot. One even suggested Sir Winston himself, no grammatical slouch he, wouldn’t even notice. Regardless of what side of the coin Britons fall on with, the new note is here to stay. The old fiver it replaces will be worthless come Friday, May 5, declared to no longer be legal tender. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

‘Apartheid’ furor comes amid 50 years of Israeli occupation
.B
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Labeling Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as “apartheid” is like flinging a burning match into spilled gasoline — so combustible are the passions on both sides. Rima Khalaf did just that when a report commissioned by her U.N. agency accused Israel of having established an apartheid regime designed to dominate the Palestinian people as a whole. In a swift outcry, Israel slammed the 65-page document as anti-Semitic. The U.S. demanded its removal and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ordered it quashed, saying it did not reflect his views. Rather than comply, Khalaf resigned as head of ESCWA, a Beirut-based agency with 18 Arab member states and one of several U.N. regional bodies dealing with economic and social issues. More than a month later, Khalaf has no regrets. The report’s charge of apartheid — a “crime against humanity” in the eyes of the International Criminal Court — deserves serious examination, she said in an interview. “We are not here for defamation,” Khalaf said. “We are here for solving the problem.” The former U.N. undersecretary general said the international community has failed the Palestinians and must sanction Israel if it wants to regain credibility. Israeli government official Michael Oren disputed the apartheid charge as a “big lie,” portraying the report as the latest attempt to “apply a completely unique standard to Israel which by definition is anti-Semitic.” Official Israel and its supporters are outraged at comparisons to apartheid-era South Africa, pointing to the many differences: Unlike disenfranchised blacks in segregated South Africa, Israel’s Arab citizens, about 20 percent of the population, can vote, are represented in parliament and on the Supreme Court, and easily mingle with Jewish Israelis in daily life. “There are no separate bathrooms, there is no apartheid here,” said Oren, a deputy minister of diplomacy. “It’s not just deeply offensive to Israelis. It is deeply offensive to the real victims of apartheid.” The report says apartheid is more than an exact replica of conditions in pre-1994 South Africa. It notes that international conventions and the ICC define it more broadly, as “inhumane acts” committed in the context of institutionalized and systematic oppression of one racial group by another, with the intention of maintaining that regime. Such expanded parameters could conceivably apply at least in some of the Israeli-controlled territories, according to critics of Israeli policy. In the West Bank, military rule has sharply curtailed Palestinian movement, trade and access to resources, while Jewish settlers in the same territory enjoy full rights of Israeli citizens. Jews and Arabs in the West Bank live under different legal systems, with Jews having far more protections. A Palestinian state carved from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, has been touted as the redress. But 50 years on, a partition deal appears distant, even as President Donald Trump says he’ll try to broker one. Israel has said it is willing to negotiate, blaming Palestinians for past failures, but a majority in Israel’s Cabinet opposes Palestinian statehood, some seek partial annexation of the West Bank, and settlement construction continues unabated. The report describes a “regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole” in complex ways that it says include a calculated fragmentation. Divided into groups— citizens in Israel, permanent residents in east Jerusalem, stateless occupied subjects elsewhere — Palestinians are prevented from effectively resisting Israeli control, it says. But the report goes well beyond past warnings by some, including former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, that an apartheid-like situation could emerge unless a two-state solution is reached. It suggests that beyond the question of the occupied areas, Israel itself must eliminate laws that discriminate among Jewish and Arab citizens. Israel “can be a Jewish state” provided all citizens enjoy equal rights, according to Khalaf, who is of Palestinian origin. “If this is the case, then the label really doesn’t matter,” she said in the interview in Jordan, where she once held senior Cabinet posts and where she now lives again. Detailing the most controversial charge of apartheid in Israel itself, the report argues that voting rights of Arab citizens lose significance because Israel’s Basic Law bars any political parties that deny Israel’s identity as both Jewish and democratic. This prevents Arab citizens from “challenging laws that perpetuate inequality,” it said. Arab politicians in Israel appear divided on the issue. Some avoid using seemingly provocative terms like apartheid. They prefer to work within the system to try to alleviate what has been widely acknowledged as longstanding official discrimination, such as preferential state spending on Jewish communities. Others, like parliament member Jamal Zahalka of the Joint List, an alliance of four Arab-dominated parties, say Israel has created a version of apartheid, including discriminatory rules on immigration and land use, even if it differs from the former South African system. He noted that Jews from anywhere in the world can claim Israeli citizenship while Arab citizens are barred from bringing Palestinian spouses from the occupied territories to live with them in Israel. Oren said fast-tracking Jewish immigration is a “correction to a terrible historic injustice of 2,000 years of statelessness for the Jewish people.” He also argued Israel is one of many nation-states, and pointed to other countries with preferential immigration rules, such as Germany which repatriated large numbers of ethnic Germans. “While we recognize the Palestinians as a people, endowed with the right of self-determination in what they regard as their homeland, that recognition is not reciprocated,” Oren said, reflecting the widespread view in Israel that those making apartheid claims want to delegitimize and eliminate Israel as a Jewish state. Many Israelis feel singled out because only their country has suffered the apartheid allegations so far, despite the fact that there are many cases of discrimination elsewhere, including in the Arab world. Legally, the crime of apartheid is still largely uncharted territory, said Sari Bashi, the Israel/Palestine advocacy director of the international group Human Rights Watch. So far, the ICC has not made such a charge, and evidence of racial discrimination is not sufficient to make the case. “The broader question is whether taken as a whole the entire system constitutes apartheid,” Bashi said. “It’s a question that certainly has not been adjudicated, and we don’t have judicial rulings from other parts of the world that would provide a clear answer.” U.N. chief Guterres hasn’t discussed the substance of the report despite appeals by Khalaf. But in a recent speech to the World Jewish Congress, an umbrella group of Jewish communities, he suggested he was siding with some of the complaints, saying that “the state of Israel needs to be treated as any other state.” He stuck by his principles even when it required decisions that “create some uncomfortable situations,” he said, an apparent reference to ordering the report removed from the ESCWA website. Khalaf, who resigned two weeks before her scheduled retirement, believes Guterres was pressured by the U.S., Israel’s strongest ally, at a time when the Trump administration is threatening to cut U.N. funding significantly. Guterres‘ office declined comment. President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian government in parts of the West Bank, has praised Khalaf for “courage and support” for the Palestinian people. Khalaf rejected allegations of bias by those who produced the report. One author is Richard Falk, a former Princeton University professor who published blistering critiques of Israeli policies in his former role as U.N. special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights. “Let’s not focus on the messenger,” Khalaf said. “Let’s focus on the facts.”She said she hopes the debate started by the report will continue. “This is not a verdict by a court,” she said. “It is a scholarly work. We want to make sure everyone has a chance to look at it and discuss it openly, because we want a solution.” ___ Mohammed Daraghmeh contributed from Ramallah, West Bank.

Kasich: Time for North Korea’s leadership to go
.B
Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Friday the leadership of North Korea needs to go, and said he expects military leaders are considering options on how best to accomplish that goal. Mr. Kasich, though, said he does not support a full-scale military operation and declined to fill in how exactly the United States should oust North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and his top allies. “I believe the best way to solve this problem is to eradicate the leadership,” Mr. Kasich told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “I am talking about those who are closest in making the decision that North Korea is following now.” Mr. Kasich is making the rounds promoting his latest book “Two Paths: America Divided Or United.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

U.N. Security Council to confer on North Korea nuclear program
.B
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Turning to diplomacy after flexing military muscle, the United States will urge the U.N. Security Council on Friday to increase economic pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, leaning on China in particular to turn the screws on its wayward ally. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met with his counterparts from allies Japan and South Korea and was set to chair a ministerial meeting of the U.N.’s top decision-making body. The U.S. wants to tighten the implementation of sanctions and build international resolve to isolate North Korea so it eventually disarms. That’s a goal that has eluded U.S. administrations for two decades, and the threat is intensifying. North Korea may already be able to strike its U.S.-allied neighbors with a nuclear-tipped missile, and could have the U.S. mainland within range by the end of President Donald Trump’s first term. Tensions on and around the divided Korean Peninsula have been running high. In an attempt to deter North Korea from more nuclear and missile testing, the U.S. has sent a group of American warships led by an aircraft carrier to the region. North Korea this week conducted large-scale, live-fire exercises on its eastern coast. “Right now, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is under very grave tension and at a critical point,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Friday. However, after weeks of unusually blunt military threats, the Trump administration announced this week its policy is to exert economic and diplomatic pressure with international partners to achieve denuclearization and said it is not aiming for regime change in North Korea. Officials say, however, a military strike is still an option. While the U.S. is calling for global action, it says the onus is on China to ramp up pressure on North Korea, its main trading partner and source of food and fuel aid. China wants North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program but is wary of destabilizing its traditional ally, on whose side it fought in the 1950-53 Korean War. Tillerson said in an interview Thursday that Beijing has threatened to impose unilateral sanctions on North Korea if it conducts further nuclear tests. It conducted two last year and satellite imagery in recent weeks has suggested another could be imminent. China “confirmed to us that they had requested the regime conduct no further nuclear test,” Tillerson said on Fox News Channel. Wang Yi did not answer Friday when asked about Tillerson’s assertion “that if they did conduct further nuclear tests, China would be taking sanctions actions on their own.” Wang said China agrees to step up efforts on nonproliferation. He said it is committed to realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and upholding stability there and not allowing war to break out. He repeated a proposal for North Korea to suspend its nuclear and missile activities in exchange for a suspension of large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises - which the allies have rejected. In February, China said it was suspending for the rest of the year coal imports that are an important revenue source for North Korea. Beijing said that was to adhere to the latest in a series of Security Council resolutions aimed at curbing the North’s nuclear and missile programs. Other Chinese economic activity with North Korea remains robust. In a separate interview with National Public Radio, Tillerson said the U.S. remains open to holding direct negotiations with Pyongyang. “But North Korea has to decide they’re ready to talk to us about the about the right agenda, and the right agenda is not simply stopping where they are for a few more months or a few more years and then resuming things,” he said. “That’s been the agenda for the last 20 years.” China is eager to see a resumption of negotiations. Six-nation talks with North Korea on its nuclear program, hosted by Beijing, stalled in 2008. The Obama administration attempted to resurrect them in 2012, but a deal to provide food aid in exchange for a nuclear freeze soon collapsed. “What is crucial today is to resume the talks. It could be either bilateral, trilateral or multilateral, but ultimately we hope we will get back to the six-party talks because the six parties are the six parties that are directly related to the issue on the peninsula,” Wang said. North Korea says it needs nuclear weapons because of the “hostile” policy of the U.S. toward it, and has threatened nuclear strikes if there is war. It complained this week that the Security Council rejected its request last month to discuss the U.S.-South Korea military exercises it says are a rehearsal for invasion. The U.S. is currently president of the 15-member Security Council. Although South Korea is not currently on the council it will also address the meeting. As of late Thursday, North Korea had not requested to speak. Tillerson will have separate meetings Friday with British Foreign Secretary Johnson, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters Thursday that “the world cannot ignore” the emerging threat of the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear capability. French Ambassador Francois Delattre said it supports America and others in seeking to maximize pressure on the North Korean government. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

For Trump in White House, conflicts of interest range widely
.B
NEW YORK (AP) - When it comes to avoiding conflicts of interest in the White House, President Donald Trump has ripped up the playbook in his first 100 days. Most presidents have taken pains to avoid even any appearance that they might be exploiting their office for personal financial gain. Trump doesn’t seem too worried. His company has doubled membership fees at his Palm Beach club, whose popularity has benefited from press coverage of his meetings there with political leaders. The Trump Organization, now under the leadership of his sons Don Jr. and Eric Trump, has proceeded with overseas resort projects, thereby handing foreign governments potential leverage to influence the president. Trump has boasted of the charms of his new luxurious Washington hotel despite the impropriety of having diplomats bent on advancing their countries’ interests spend money there. Asked about a lawsuit filed by a watchdog group accusing him of profiting off the presidency, Trump was dismissive: “Totally without merit.” Before taking office Trump did announce some steps to limit personal conflicts for himself or his family. He vowed that his company would strike no new deals abroad, subject deals in the United States to review by an ethics lawyer and cede management control of operations to Don Jr. and Eric. But given his sprawling worldwide holdings, no one expects the financial ethics questions for the 45th president to end soon. The latest flare-up involves the tax-cut plan his administration announced Wednesday. Critics denounced it as a brazen giveaway to Trump and his family. The proposal would eliminate the estate tax, repeal the alternative minimum tax that affects some affluent people, deeply slash corporate rates, reduce investment taxes and allow “pass-through” firms to qualify for a much lower rate - all of which could benefit Trump, his family or his businesses. The White House has argued that its tax-cut plan would help lower and middle class families, too, and speed economic growth. Below is a rundown of some conflicts in the first 100 days of his presidency. ___ THE WINTER WHITE HOUSE Since Trump became president, he has spent about half his weekends at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, where he has hosted the prime minister of Japan and the president of China. Since inauguration, he has doubled membership fees to join the club to $200,000. Presidents have invited political leaders to their properties before, of course. Franklin D. Roosevelt brought dignitaries to his Hyde Park estate near New York City. But FDR wasn’t running the property as a business and making money off it. ___ THE D.C. HOTEL AND A NEW CHAIN To limit foreign influence over his policies, Trump said he wouldn’t strike any new business deals abroad. But governments have many other ways to curry favor with him. Exhibit A: The Trump International Hotel near the White House, where diplomats like to stay and the embassies of Bahrain and Azerbaijan recently threw parties, according to a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The watchdog group argues that the president is violating a clause in the U.S. Constitution barring him from accepting payments from foreign governments without Congress’ consent. A lawyer for the president says diplomats are just paying their hotel bills - a “fair value” exchange not barred by the Constitution. And Trump has promised to donate any profits from foreign governments that use his hotels to the U.S. Treasury. Plans by the Trump Organization to open lower-priced hotels in the United States using money from outside investors are also worrying ethics groups. They warn that investors might use their participation in a hotel rollout as a way to buy influence in Washington. The issue flared after media reports in March that a Texas developer wanted to use money from unnamed investors in Qatar, Kazakhstan and Turkey to build one of the hotels in Dallas. The Trump Organization recently canceled talks with the developer. The Trump Organization hopes to open as many as 100 of these hotels, called Scion, in three years. ___ NEW TRADEMARKS OVERSEAS Since his election, the president has been granted preliminary approval for 38 trademarks in China for hotels and golf clubs and others businesses there. In the past, his company has sometimes struggled to secure such valuable monopoly naming rights. Suspicions have arisen that Beijing is giving Trump’s company favored treatment now that its owner sits in the Oval Office. In its lawsuit, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues that the trademark approvals violate the U.S. Constitution. China says it handles all trademark applications “in accordance with the law and regulation.” ___ IVANKA THE BRAND Ivanka Trump is receiving good news from China, too. Since the inauguration, the president’s daughter and West Wing adviser has received preliminary approval for five trademarks in China. Three of them were greenlighted the same day that she and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, sat beside President Xi Jinping and his wife for a lavish dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The trademarks grant her monopoly rights to use her name for jewelry, bags and spa services. Public records show that her company has more than 180 pending and registered trademarks around the world. Ivanka Trump’s company says all 2017 Chinese trademarks were filed not with the intention of setting up businesses but to prevent counterfeiters or squatters from using her name. The first daughter has pledged to recuse herself from issues that pose conflicts while her father is president. Sales and shipping data suggest that her business has boomed in recent months, especially in February. That was the month when Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide, suggested that Fox News viewers “Go buy Ivanka stuff.” The number of Ivanka-branded items sold through Lyst, an e-commerce platform, spiked 771 percent in February from the same month a year ago. As a federal employee, Conway is barred by ethics rules from using her office to promote a business or product. ___ TROUBLE WITH JARED White House ties appear to be hurting the Kushner family real estate business, not helping it, at least at one important property. Its struggling flagship skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue needs an infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars, and a giant Chinese company was negotiating earlier this year with the Kushner family to provide the money. But then media reports highlighted the Chinese company’s ties to the ruling Communist Party and how its investment could give Beijing leverage on some issues with the White House. Negotiations were called off in March. To comply with ethics rules, Jared Kushner has sold his stake in the Fifth Avenue building and some other assets to relatives. He still holds a financial interest in hundreds of entities, though. And it’s unclear who the lenders and partners in many of the entities are and who might benefit from policies that Kushner could affect now. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump’s first 100 days: A president’s very public education
.B
WASHINGTON (AP) - Health care is complicated. China can be a useful ally. NATO isn’t obsolete. Being president is hard. Over the course of his 100 days in office, President Donald Trump has been startlingly candid about his public education in the ways of Washington and the world. He’s been blocked by the courts and befuddled by a divided Republican Party that’s running Congress, and his first months on the job have left the long-time reality-TV and real estate tycoon struggling for major governing victories and searching for a new approach to many of his campaign promises. His “America first” campaign rhetoric has bumped up against the challenges of conflict overseas. His ambitious declarations on health care and immigration have run into the limits of Congress and the courts. A president who prides himself on his ideological flexibility has struggled to manage a novice political team, split between moderate and conservative advisers, and he’s found himself reaching out to the friends and business associates from the world he left behind. On foreign policy, Trump has been persuaded by foreign leaders and has leaned heavily on a national security team with more governing experience than his political advisers. He’s looked for lessons in his biggest victory: putting a conservative judge, Neil Gorsuch, on the Supreme Court. “I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility,” Trump said in an Associated Press interview, assessing the difficulty of the presidency. “This is tougher than what he thought,” said Trump friend and business partner Phil Ruffin, who has visited the president twice since he took office Jan. 20. “In business, you make a decision and it happens. In government, it’s not like that.” Just days into Trump’s presidency, the courts rejected his first travel ban. Since then, they’ve pushed back on his rewritten travel ban and his attempt to cut federal money for cities that harbor people who are in the United States illegally. But Trump’s roughest lesson has come from Congress, which has balked at his attempt to repeal the Obama-era health law his party campaigned against for years. During the campaign, Trump said the Affordable Care Act would be gone on his first day in the White House. In the weeks after his inauguration, the realities set it. By February, he told a group of governors that “it’s an unbelievably complex subject,” adding: “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” For Trump, the health care battle was a rude introduction to the complicated internal politics in the Republican-run House, which includes hard-liners in the Freedom Caucus and moderates in the Tuesday Group. When the White House made concessions to conservatives, it pushed some moderates away, and vice versa. Unable to cut a deal in late March, House Republicans pulled the health bill from consideration. Trump lashed out at Freedom Caucus leaders on Twitter and indicated he would seek retribution come campaign season. Trump’s team tried to pick up the pieces but hasn’t gotten there yet. A renewed burst of momentum this past week, buoyed by hopes the House would vote before Saturday, Trump’s 100th day, petered out. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he would not be rushed by the president’s deadline. The contrast between the scuttled first attempt on health care and the relative smooth sailing of Gorsuch was a learning experience. The takeaway: working behind the scenes with outside groups, which lined up solidly behind Gorsuch, and lawmakers can pay dividends. “Outreach to partner organizations starting sooner is helpful and I think that you will see that,” said Marc Short, the White House legislative director. “Probably we were a little bit surprised when we engaged some of the conservative groups on health care that they felt they’d been left out of the conversation from the Hill.” None of Trump’s top advisers had deep experience in legislating. Now they’ve begun to compensate with outreach. The White House has hosted 230 members of Congress, and there have been 10 bowling sessions in the Executive Mansion’s basement. But no amount of bowling can overcome the division in the Republican Party. The president has seemed taken aback. In the AP interview, Trump said there was “a pretty vast area” between the approach by the most conservative members of his party and those who are more moderate. To bridge the divides, Trump’s advisers have worked to moderate between the factions as his team tries to revive the health bill. The White House is taking a similar approach on the president’s tax plan. Restless in Washington, Trump is working at “breakneck speed,” chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters. Sometimes so quickly that his own advisers can’t keep up. The president’s declaration last week that his team would release a tax proposal before the 100 day mark startled some in the White House, who scrambled to put together the one-page outline that was released Wednesday. The proposal lacks the details about making taxes simpler and more efficient in ways that don’t add to the federal government’s mounting debt. Those are core Republican principles that would require lawmakers to eliminate or reduce precious tax breaks enjoyed by millions of people. Trump did meet his goal of starting work on the plan in his first 100 days, but another tough challenge awaits on Capitol Hill as he still contends with health care. Trump’s frustration with a lack of progress has sometimes erupted in anger - and sometimes in the direction of his political advisers. He’s frequently blamed his team for being unable to quash negative stories. He was particularly incensed by the steady drip of revelations about his campaign’s possible ties to Russia. After Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped aside from Russia investigations because of his own undisclosed contacts with a Russian ambassador, Trump unleashed on his top advisers in an Oval Office meeting. Sessions’ decision overshadowed Trump’s well-received first address to Congress days earlier; it was a speech the White House hoped would give the president a burst of momentum. But ultimately it was Trump himself who created the biggest distraction. The morning after his Oval Office row with his staff, he tweeted a series of inflammatory accusations about his predecessor wiretapping Trump’s New York skyscraper. One of the lowest moments of Trump’s young administration was the forced resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who misled the White House about his Russia ties. Flynn’s departure cleared the way for a well-received overhaul of the National Security Council. Trump has relied heavily on Flynn’s replacement, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who has formed an alliance of experience with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The president has largely heeded their advice on major foreign policy decisions and given the Pentagon vast control over military operations around the world. It’s been Trump’s evolution on foreign affairs that’s perhaps been clearest to track. Confronted with photos of injured children, victims of a chemical attack in Syria, Trump quickly pivoted from what he billed as an “America first” policy during the campaign in favor of intervention. After listening to European leaders make the case for NATO, he stopped saying it was obsolete. And after pleas from business executives and warnings of economic turmoil from foreign leaders, Trump just this week abruptly abandoned plans to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Each shift has different forces behind it. On Syria, Priebus said he said sees a “Trump Doctrine” coming into focus: a combination of putting America first but not sitting around while world injustices, such as the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons, go unanswered. In some cases, Trump has acknowledged he was ill-informed during his campaign. As a candidate, he dismissed the NATO alliance without knowing much about it, he told AP last week. “Now I know a lot.” He had pledged to label China a currency manipulator, part of his tough-on-China populist rhetoric. But after a particularly warm visit from President Xi Jinping, Trump acknowledged the downside to alienating a power that could be a useful partner in curbing North Korea’s nuclear program. “The bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he’s helping us with North Korea,” he said. “What am I going to do, say, ‘By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you’re a currency manipulator.’ It doesn’t work that way.” Trump has proved to be open to persuasion, particularly from world leaders and outside forces. When news spread Thursday that Trump was considering triggering the U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, the leaders of Mexico and Canada launched a diplomatic full-court press to persuade Trump to rethink the plan. It took only a matter of hours before the president relented. __ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Julie Pace contributed to this report. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

The Latest: Trump says China putting pressure on North Korea
.B
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - The Latest on North Korea test-firing a missile (all times local): 8:38 a.m. Sunday President Donald Trump says he believes China’s president has been putting pressure on North Korea as it pursues its missile and nuclear weapons programs. In an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Trump says he won’t be happy if North Korea conducts a nuclear test and that he believes Chinese President Xi Jinping won’t be happy, either. Asked if that means military action, Trump responded: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.” The interview is set to air later Sunday in the U.S. ___ 5:35 a.m. Sunday Pope Francis is warning that “a good part of humanity” will be destroyed if tensions with North Korea escalate, and he is calling for diplomacy and a revived United Nations to take the lead in negotiating a resolution. Francis was asked as he traveled back to Rome from Egypt on Saturday local time (Sunday morning Seoul time) about North Korean ballistic missile tests and U.S. warnings of “catastrophic” consequences if the world fails to stop them. He was asked specifically what he would tell U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sent a U.S. carrier to conduct drills near the Koreas, and other leaders to try to diffuse the tensions. Francis says he would urge them to use diplomacy and negotiation “because it’s the future of humanity.” “Today, a wider war will destroy not a small part of humanity, but a good part of humanity and culture. Everything. Everything, no? It would be terrible. I don’t think humanity today could bear it,” he told reporters. ___ 6:45 p.m. Saturday South Korea’s navy says it has started joint exercises with U.S. ships, including the supercarrier USS Carl Vinson, which the United States dispatched to the region in a show of force amid the growing threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The drills began Saturday hours after South Korean and U.S. officials said they detected what they presumed was a failed missile launch from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The South Korean navy says the drill is aimed at “deterring North Korea’s provocations and displaying the firm alliance between the United States and South Korea.” The USS Carl Vinson also participated in annual springtime drills between United States and South Korea in March. ___ 5:35 p.m. Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende said Saturday on Twitter that “new missile test violates SC (Security Council) resolution. Urgent need for common action to reduce tension.” Norway, which is not a current member of the Security Council, is a founding member of the United Nations and has always considered the body as a cornerstone in its foreign policy. ___ 1:05 p.m. One of Tokyo’s major subways systems says it shut down all lines for 10 minutes early Saturday after receiving warning of a North Korean missile launch. Tokyo Metro official Hiroshi Takizawa says the temporary suspension affected 13,000 passengers. Service was halted on all nine lines at 6:07 a.m. It resumed at 6:17 a.m. after it was clear there was no threat to Japan. Takizawa says it was the first time service had been stopped in response to a missile launch. Train service is generally suspended in Japan immediately after large earthquakes. Tokyo Metro decided earlier this month to stop for missile launch warnings as well. ___ 11:35 a.m. North Korea’s state media has reiterated the country’s goal of developing a nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States on the same day rivals Washington and Seoul detected a failed missile launch from an area near Pyongyang. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper also said Saturday that the North revealed two types of new intercontinental ballistic missiles in an April 15 military parade honoring its late state founder, Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un. The parade featured previously unseen large rocket canisters and launcher trucks. It said: “The large territory that is the United States has been entirely exposed to our pre-emptive nuclear strike means.” Referring to the United States sending the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to Korean waters, the newspaper said that “rendering aircraft carriers useless is not even a problem” for its military. The newspaper says that the North displayed three types of ICBMs during the parade, including two new types that were inside the canisters. Analysts say the North’s existing liquid-fuel ICBMS, including the KN-08 and KN-14, are potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, although the North has never flight tested them. ___ 10 a.m. Japan’s government spokesman says the missile launched by North Korea is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers (30 miles) and fallen on an inland part of the country. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga (yoh-shee-hee-deh soo-gah) said the ballistic missile was fired to the northeast around 5:30 a.m. from an area in the vicinity of Pukchang, north of Pyongyang, the capital. He spoke at a news conference following a meeting of Japan’s National Security Council. ___ 9:45 a.m. France’s U.N. ambassador says the U.N. Security Council is “mobilized” and unanimous on the need to denuclearize North Korea. Francois Delattre said at the United Nations after North Korea’s apparently failed missile launch Saturday that while there were “nuances” on policy to be worked out among council members, there is unanimity on the need for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea fired the missile hours after the Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang’s escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Delattre says the council must be “very firm” implementing sanctions, adopting new ones if necessary and denouncing North Korea’s human rights record. ___ 8:50 a.m. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says a North Korean missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers (44 miles) before it apparently failed Saturday. The joint chiefs said in a statement on Saturday that the missile was fired 49 degrees northeast from an area near Pukchang, just north of the capital Pyongyang. It didn’t immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew. South Korea says it’s still analyzing what type of missile the North fired. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the missile was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile and that it broke up a couple of minutes after launch. ___ 8:38 a.m. President Donald Trump says North Korea “disrespected” China with its most recent ballistic missile test. South Korea’s military said in a statement Friday afternoon that North Korea had fired the missile from an area near the capital of Pyongyang, but provided no other details. U.S. and South Korean officials say the launch apparently failed. Trump did not answer reporters’ questions about the missile launch upon returning to the White House from a daytrip to Atlanta. But he commented on Twitter, saying, “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” ___ 8:30 a.m. Japan has protested the latest missile launch by North Korea. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga (yoh-shee-hee-deh soo-gah) said Saturday that a ballistic missile firing would be “a clear violation of U.N. security council resolutions.” He added that Japan “cannot accept repeated provocation by North Korea” and had “lodged a strong protest against North Korea.” Japan has become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility of a North Korean missile attack targeting Japan or U.S. forces stationed in Japan. ___ 8:15 a.m. Japan’s public broadcaster NHK has aired footage of a U.S. aircraft carrier sailing off the coast of Nagasaki prefecture in southern Japan. The USS Carl Vinson is heading north toward the Korean peninsula in a show of force after satellite images suggested North Korea may be preparing to conduct a nuclear test. NHK said it shot the footage Saturday morning from a helicopter. Nagasaki is in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s four main islands. The Vinson conducted joint training Friday with two Japanese destroyers and two Japanese F-15 fighter jets in waters further south off the Japanese island of Okinawa. ___ 7:35 a.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has been briefed on North Korea’s most recent ballistic missile test. South Korea’s military said in a statement Friday afternoon that North Korea had fired the missile from an area around the capital of Pyongyang, but provided no other details. U.S. and South Korean officials say the launch apparently failed. Trump returned to the White House from a trip to Atlanta shortly after the news broke. He did not answer reporters’ questions about the missile launch. Trump has threatened military action if North Korea continues its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. He has also said he would prefer to resolve the issue through diplomacy. __ 7:12 a.m. A U.S. official says North Korea has tested what was likely a medium-range ballistic missile. The official says the missile broke up a couple minutes after the launch and the pieces fell into the Sea of Japan. The official was citing an American assessment and says it appeared to be a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. -Lolita C.

Trump says he’s brought ‘profound change’ to Washington
.B
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Saturday marked his 100th day in office by saying he had brought “profound change” to Washington and reaffirming that “my only allegiance” is to those he governs. On a threshold that Trump has both derided and tried to define, the president also said he is putting Americans first even as he learns on the job. “My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens,” Trump said in his weekly radio address. It was a preview of a day on which Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to emphasize such priorities as American manufacturing, better trade deals for the U.S. and his underdog victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. He also was promoting a still-to-be defined tax cut plan and the nation’s strong economy, on which many of his political fortunes rest. Meanwhile, North Korea’s missile launch Saturday signaled its continued defiance against the U.S., China and other nations, on which Trump tweeted: “Bad!” Asked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” if military action would follow a nuclear test by the North, Trump responded: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.” Trump’s 100th day events were set in politically important Pennsylvania, which he won with 48 percent of the vote. It was the first time the state had voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. In Pennsylvania, Trump was visiting a shovel company when he signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a study of U.S. trade agreements. The goal is to determine whether America is being treated fairly by its trading partners and the 164-nation World Trade Organization. The AMES Companies in Pennsylvania’s Cumberland County has manufactured shovels since 1774. After Trump’s visit there, he was to hold a campaign-style rally in Harrisburg, the state capital. Democrats planned their own rally nearby. Trump’s 100-day rally was a bit of counterprogramming from the former reality television star. Back in Washington, media organizations and a few stars were gathering on Saturday for the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Trump, who has derided journalists as “dishonest” and even enemies of the American people, is the first president since 1981 to stay away from the event. That year, Ronald Reagan was recovering from an assassination attempt. At the 100-day mark, Trump chose instead to spend the evening with people who helped elect him and, polls show, remain largely in his corner. Though the White House created a website touting its accomplishments of the first hundred days, Trump has tried to downplay the importance of the marker, perhaps out of recognition that many of his campaign promises have gone unfulfilled. “It’s a false standard, 100 days,” Trump said while signing an executive order on Friday, “but I have to tell you, I don’t think anybody has done what we’ve been able to do in 100 days, so we’re very happy.” His rally Saturday in Pennsylvania will give him a chance “to talk to voters about what he has done over the past 100 days and how he sees the next 100 days and the 100 days after that,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. A failed effort to overhaul President Barack Obama’s health care law behind him, Trump is turning to what he’s billed as the nation’s biggest tax cut. It apparently falls short of Reagan’s in 1981, and tax experts are skeptical that the plan would pay for itself, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has claimed. The economy, so far, has been Trump’s ally. Polls show that Americans feel slightly better about his job performance on that subject than his job performance overall. “Together we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American people first,” Trump said in his weekly radio and internet address. “That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That day was a turning point for our nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.” He said in his remarks: “In just 14 weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington.” Executive orders in line to be signed Saturday would be the 31st and 32nd since Trump took office __ the most of any president in his first 100 days since World War II. During the campaign, Trump railed against Obama’s use of orders, which don’t need congressional approval. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Lemire and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___ Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump: North Korea ‘disrespected’ China with missile test
.B
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump said Friday that North Korea had “disrespected” China by attempting to launch another ballistic missile. Trump has said he is counting on Chinese President Xi Jinping to encourage North Korea to give up its pursuit of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Trump has also said he thinks Xi will do the right thing. China is North Korea’s benefactor. But Trump has also threatened to go it alone if Xi fails to deliver. South Korea’s military said Friday afternoon that North Korea had fired the missile from an area near the capital of Pyongyang, but provided no details. U.S. and South Korean officials said the launch apparently failed, with the missile breaking apart a few minutes after launch. Trump did not answer reporters’ questions about the missile launch as he entered the White House after he returned from a daytrip to Atlanta. Shortly afterward, press secretary Sean Spicer said the White House was aware of the launch and Trump had been briefed on it. Trump apparently reserved his comment about the launch for Twitter, writing on the social media site: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” Trump has threatened North Korea with military action if it continues developing nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But he has also said he would prefer to resolve the issue through diplomacy. Hours before the launch, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson chaired a U.N. Security Council meeting devoted to the North Korea issue and called for new sanctions against Pyongyang. Tillerson also urged other countries to exert pressure on North Korea. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his country would adhere to past U.N. resolutions and wants a denuclearized Korean peninsula, but spelled out no further punitive steps his government might consider - despite Tillerson’s assertions in an interview hours ahead of the council meeting that Beijing would impose sanctions of its own if North Korea conducts another nuclear test. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

West Coast dockworkers to vote on deal seeking labor peace
.B
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Dockworkers were given the chance Friday to vote on a new contract extension that could provide long-term labor peace at West Coast seaports, where in recent years work slowdowns and strikes have affected billions of dollars in cargo. Union delegates for 29 ports from Washington to California voted to allow about 20,000 rank-and-file members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to vote on a proposal from employers. The deal from the Pacific Maritime Association would move the expiration date of the current contract from 2019 to 2022. The offer includes a wage increase of 3.1 percent per year and pension increases. The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping companies and port terminal operators, praised the decision to bring the offer to a vote. “Extending our contract would maintain stability on the waterfront for the next five years - a crucial time as the West Coast waterfront faces increased competition from other North American ports, and as the maritime industry continues to battle global economic challenges,” spokesman Wade Gates said. West Coast ports handle a huge volume of trans-Pacific trade that is vital to the U.S. economy. They include the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports which together form the largest container shipping port in the nation. But the ports also have a contentious labor history. In early 2015, bitter negotiations over the contract now in effect caused major disruptions in the flow of cargo. Ports from San Diego to Seattle were all but shut down as the two sides haggled. Companies that accused workers of coordinated slowdowns decided to cut their shifts, shuttering ports on nights and weekends. The tit-for-tat led to long lines of ships queueing outside of harbors, waiting for space at the docks. Other strikes and lockouts affecting longshoremen, port clerks and truckers have also proven costly over the years. The contract extension is aimed at ensuring West Coast ports remain a reliable gateway for international commerce. Importers and exporters have another option in the newly expanded Panama Canal, which allows larger ships to ply the route between the East and Gulf coasts and Asia. Ports on the Pacific coast of Mexico and Canada also are vying for U.S. business. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

The Latest: Tokyo subway temporarily closed over N. Korea
.B
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - The Latest on North Korea test-firing a missile Saturday (all times local): 1:05 p.m. One of Tokyo’s major subways systems says it shut down all lines for 10 minutes early Saturday after receiving warning of a North Korean missile launch. Tokyo Metro official Hiroshi Takizawa says the temporary suspension affected 13,000 passengers. Service was halted on all nine lines at 6:07 a.m. It resumed at 6:17 a.m. after it was clear there was no threat to Japan. Takizawa says it was the first time service had been stopped in response to a missile launch. Train service is generally suspended in Japan immediately after large earthquakes. Tokyo Metro decided earlier this month to stop for missile launch warnings as well. ___ 11:35 a.m. North Korea’s state media has reiterated the country’s goal of developing a nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States on the same day rivals Washington and Seoul detected a failed missile launch from an area near Pyongyang. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper also said Saturday that the North revealed two types of new intercontinental ballistic missiles in an April 15 military parade honoring its late state founder, Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un. The parade featured previously unseen large rocket canisters and launcher trucks. It said: “The large territory that is the United States has been entirely exposed to our pre-emptive nuclear strike means.” Referring to the United States sending the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to Korean waters, the newspaper said that “rendering aircraft carriers useless is not even a problem” for its military. The newspaper says that the North displayed three types of ICBMs during the parade, including two new types that were inside the canisters. Analysts say the North’s existing liquid-fuel ICBMS, including the KN-08 and KN-14, are potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, although the North has never flight tested them. ___ 10 a.m. Japan’s government spokesman says the missile launched by North Korea is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers (30 miles) and fallen on an inland part of the country. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga (yoh-shee-hee-deh soo-gah) said the ballistic missile was fired to the northeast around 5:30 a.m. from an area in the vicinity of Pukchang, north of Pyongyang, the capital. He spoke at a news conference following a meeting of Japan’s National Security Council. ___ 9:45 a.m. France’s U.N. ambassador says the U.N. Security Council is “mobilized” and unanimous on the need to denuclearize North Korea. Francois Delattre said at the United Nations after North Korea’s apparently failed missile launch Saturday that while there were “nuances” on policy to be worked out among council members, there is unanimity on the need for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea fired the missile hours after the Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang’s escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Delattre says the council must be “very firm” implementing sanctions, adopting new ones if necessary and denouncing North Korea’s human rights record. ___ 8:50 a.m. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff says a North Korean missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers (44 miles) before it apparently failed Saturday. The joint chiefs said in a statement on Saturday that the missile was fired 49 degrees northeast from an area near Pukchang, just north of the capital Pyongyang. It didn’t immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew. South Korea says it’s still analyzing what type of missile the North fired. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the missile was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile and that it broke up a couple of minutes after launch. ___ 8:38 a.m. President Donald Trump says North Korea “disrespected” China with its most recent ballistic missile test. South Korea’s military said in a statement Friday afternoon that North Korea had fired the missile from an area near the capital of Pyongyang, but provided no other details. U.S. and South Korean officials say the launch apparently failed. Trump did not answer reporters’ questions about the missile launch upon returning to the White House from a daytrip to Atlanta. But he commented on Twitter, saying, “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” ___ 8:30 a.m. Japan has protested the latest missile launch by North Korea. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga (yoh-shee-hee-deh soo-gah) said Saturday that a ballistic missile firing would be “a clear violation of U.N. security council resolutions.” He added that Japan “cannot accept repeated provocation by North Korea” and had “lodged a strong protest against North Korea.” Japan has become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility of a North Korean missile attack targeting Japan or U.S. forces stationed in Japan. ___ 8:15 a.m. Japan’s public broadcaster NHK has aired footage of a U.S. aircraft carrier sailing off the coast of Nagasaki prefecture in southern Japan. The USS Carl Vinson is heading north toward the Korean peninsula in a show of force after satellite images suggested North Korea may be preparing to conduct a nuclear test. NHK said it shot the footage Saturday morning from a helicopter. Nagasaki is in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s four main islands. The Vinson conducted joint training Friday with two Japanese destroyers and two Japanese F-15 fighter jets in waters further south off the Japanese island of Okinawa. ___ 7:35 a.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has been briefed on North Korea’s most recent ballistic missile test. South Korea’s military said in a statement Friday afternoon that North Korea had fired the missile from an area around the capital of Pyongyang, but provided no other details. U.S. and South Korean officials say the launch apparently failed. Trump returned to the White House from a trip to Atlanta shortly after the news broke. He did not answer reporters’ questions about the missile launch. Trump has threatened military action if North Korea continues its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. He has also said he would prefer to resolve the issue through diplomacy. __ 7:12 a.m. A U.S. official says North Korea has tested what was likely a medium-range ballistic missile. The official says the missile broke up a couple minutes after the launch and the pieces fell into the Sea of Japan. The official was citing an American assessment and says it appeared to be a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. -Lolita C.

State Department official visits Michigan charter school

MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) - A U.S. State Department official says a Detroit-area charter school provides a successful model for educating Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Deputy Assistant Secretary Joseph Pennington visited Keys Grace Academy Charter School in Madison Heights. The school has about 400 Middle Eastern children, mainly of Chaldean, Assyrian and Syriac backgrounds from Iraq and Syria. The Detroit News reports (http://detne.ws/2puaUT3 ) that after touring the school Friday, Pennington spoke to students, some of whom didn’t know the names of the cities they had fled. School officials say many children receive services to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. Pennington also addressed questions from members of the local Arab community leaders. Asked about when displaced people could return home safely, Pennington said it will be difficult for the families who return and that stabilization takes decades.

Friendly fire may have caused deaths of Army Rangers in eastern Afghanistan
.B
Two Army Rangers killed in an Islamic State ambush in eastern Afghanistan’s violent Nangarhar province Thursday may have been the victims of friendly fire, according to the Defense Department. Sgts. Joshua Rodgers and Cameron Thomas with 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, were killed during a night raid against the suspected hideout of Abdul Hasib, the alleged emir of the terror group’s Afghan cell known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria - Khorosan Province, or ISIS-K, in Nangarhar’s Achin district. American commanders in country are “investigating the possibility that the two Rangers were accidentally killed by friendly fire during the more than three-hour fight,” a statement from U.S. Forces-Afghanistan said. Neither the Pentagon or command officials in Kabul provided any additional details on the friendly fire incident or ongoing inquiry. “We have informed both of their families of this possibility and we have appointed a team to investigate the Soldiers’ deaths,” according to the statement, released Friday. Along with the deaths of Sgts. Rodgers and Thomas, U.S. and Afghan forces killed roughly 35 ISIS-K fighters, according to a command assessment of the operation. American commanders are still working to verify whether Mr. Hasib is among the dead. “If confirmed, the death of the Emir and his associates will significantly degrade ISIS-K operations in Afghanistan,” command officials say. The embattled district is suspected of being ISIS-K’s main stronghold in eastern Afghanistan. Weeks earlier an ISIS-K tunnel complex in the district was target of a massive U.S. airstrike in which American forces dropped the “mother of all bombs,” a 22,000-pound munition which is one of the largest conventional weapons in the Pentagon’s arsenal, on ISIS-K targets. It was the first time the weapon had been used in combat. Despite the massive airstrike, which according to unofficial accounts ended with over 90 fighters and senior leaders dead, Achin continues to be a focal point of U.S. and Afghan operations in the country. During Thursday’s raid, two Ranger platoons accompanying two Afghan special forces platoons launched an air assault near Mr. Hasib’s headquarters in Achin’s Mohmand Valley. “Within a few minutes of landing, our combined force came under intense fire from multiple directions and well-prepared fighting positions,” command officials said. During the ensuing firefight, U.S. forces called in airstrikes to take out enemy targets that were “close quarters from multiple compounds” surrounding the American and Afghan assault team. Defense Secretary James Mattis offered his condolences to the families of the fallen Rangers. “Fighting alongside their Afghan partners, Josh and Cameron proved themselves willing to go into danger and impose a brutal cost on enemies in their path,” the Pentagon chief said in a statement Friday. “Our nation owes them an irredeemable debt, and we give our deepest condolences to their families,” he added. Earlier this week during a surprise visit to Kabul, Mr. Mattis warned the upcoming fighting season in Afghanistan “is going to be another tough year for the valiant Afghan security forces and the international troops who have stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with Afghanistan against terrorism.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

CNN host suggests Americans wear hijabs to show solidarity with fearful Muslims
.B
A CNN host used a segment on Islamophobia on Monday to suggest American non-Muslims may want to start wearing hijabs. “New Day” with Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota featured a piece titled “The Trump transition: Fearful Muslim women take steps to be safe” just hours before Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 20, attempted to use a vehicle and a butcher knife to kill Ohio State University students. The ill-timed story ended with Ms. Camerota discussing ways to ease the fears of Muslim Americans. “Maybe there will be a movement where people wear the head scarf in solidarity. You know, even if you’re not Muslim,” Ms. Camerota said, The Daily Caller reported Tuesday. “Maybe it’s the way people shave their heads, you know, sometimes in solidarity with somebody who is going through something.” Mr. Cuomo took a breath and responded, “I think self-defense training is good for everyone.” “Yes, I know you’re a big proponent of that,” Ms. Camerota replied. News broke shortly afterward that Artan, a Somali immigrant who arrived in the U.S. in 2014, injured 11 people in Columbus. “Brother Abdul Razak Ali Artan, God accept him, implementer of the Ohio attack, a student in his third year in university,” an Islamic State news agency said in a statement after the attack, Reuters reported Tuesday. Artan was shot and killed by an Ohio State University Police Department Officer Alan Horujko, 28, when he arrived on the scene roughly one minute after the attack started. University Police Chief Craig Stone told reporters that it was “very fortunate” that Officer Horujko was able to quickly end the threat. Ms. Camerota’s idea is not entirely new. Students at the elite Paris university Sciences Po held “Hijab Day” just five months after the Nov. 13, 2015, Islamic State attack that killed 130 across the city. “France got 99 problems but Hijab ain’t one,” some of the head coverings read in reference to a song by American rapper Jay Z, Agence France-Presse reported April 20.

Trump’s unconventional foreign policy makes consequential impact in first 100 days
.B
It started with taking a protocol-shattering phone call from Taiwan. Then came an almost immediate realignment with Saudi Arabia against Iran, 59 Tomahawk missiles fired at Syria, an increasingly combative posture toward Russia, a massive military strike in Afghanistan and a level of North Korea brinkmanship not seen from U.S. administrations in decades. For all the roadblocks and headwinds President Trump has faced on the domestic front, there is little debate that he and his unconventional national security team have made a consequential impact on the course and conduct of foreign policy in his first 100 days in office. The man whose populist inauguration speech vowed to put “America first” has been dominating the headlines with aggressive foreign engagement and high-level meetings, including hosting leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago resort. From Canberra and Berlin, from Tokyo and Ankara, Mr. Trump has rankled foreign leaders with his abrasiveness while intriguing them with a willingness to rethink conventional wisdom and conventional policies in American diplomacy. It was at Mar-a-Lago, for instance, that Mr. Trump informed Mr. Xi on April 7 over a “beautiful” piece of chocolate cake that he had authorized airstrikes against Syria — the first by the U.S. to explicitly target the regime of President Bashar Assad over the suspected use of chemical weapons. It was also at his Florida winter White House that Mr. Trump’s increasingly bare-knuckle posture toward North Korea began to develop, when news broke that Pyongyang had tested a ballistic missile just as the president was wining and dining Mr. Abe. In the months since, Mr. Trump has ordered more U.S. military assets to South Korea and dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to the region to deliver the message that the “era of strategic patience” — a reference to Washington’s long-held policy of trying to pressure Pyongyang through sanctions and diplomacy — “is over.” With the prospect of a pre-emptive U.S. strike against North Korea a subject of deep speculation in Washington, Mr. Pence issued his statements on Pyongyang just after the administration’s preference for “hard” over “soft” power was put on dramatic display in Afghanistan with a massive ordnance air blast strike against suspected Islamic State hideouts this month. Critics contend that Mr. Trump still has articulated no clear strategy for North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan or the Islamic State group, let alone Iran, where authorities appear to be bracing for the president to follow through on threats to upend the multinational nuclear accord that President Obama pushed through in 2015. Trump supporters counter that the president’s actions have injected a much-needed degree of unpredictability and flexibility to American power projection around the world. Some argue that Mr. Trump was expected to emerge as a serious foreign policy president because the former property mogul and reality TV star was a global presence long before he had the chance to live on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bumpy ride All sides agree it’s been an unusually bumpy ride at the start, with Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, forced to resign just weeks into the administration. Large numbers of posts below the Cabinet level at the State Department and other agencies have yet to be filled, and a probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign and influence on the November election still hangs over the Trump administration. Still, Mr. Trump’s emerging foreign policy team is starting to win higher marks, with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster showing greater cohesion. World leaders have watched with curiosity as Mr. Trump has altered or, in a few cases, reversed major policy positions he pushed as a candidate. He campaigned on avoiding engagement in Syria’s civil war in favor of a laser focus on defeating the Islamic State terrorist group. Then he launched the missile strikes in retaliation for chemical attacks on civilians by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He declared NATO “obsolete” but has since embraced the alliance. He was accused of cozying up to the Kremlin. Now he is tough-talking to Russia. He branded China a currency manipulator, then ate cake with Mr. Xi. Mr. Trump has talked of these shifts as the mark of a deal-maker, saying on Twitter once: “‘Be flexible enough to adjust to changing circumstances.’ — Think Big.” A combination of impulse-driven action and deal-making savvy has defined the president’s first 100 days. Both were on display just before his inauguration in a December call with Taiwan’s president. It was the first in 40 years between a Taiwanese leader and an American president-elect in the wake of the 1979 “one China” policy. China was outraged. Although Mr. Trump later tamped down friction by saying he wouldn’t break with “one China,” the move appeared to have put Mr. Xi off balance ahead of talks with the new U.S. president. With Mr. Trump proposing a 28 percent cut to the State Department’s budget, Mr. Tillerson still has no administration-appointed deputy and has named only a few U.S. ambassadors to represent the president’s positions around the world. Foreign policy specialists say the evolving situation makes it hard to grade the administration’s diplomacy, even though several acknowledge that they have been impressed by the president’s focus on international affairs. “There remain reasons to be concerned, particularly about the administration’s trade agenda,” Daniel Twining, a director at the German Marshall Fund, said in an analysis that the organization circulated this week. “But U.S. power is back as a force to be reckoned with in a dangerous world, after what many saw as President Obama’s abdication of the U.S. role as global guarantor and following a political campaign in which the U.S. was presented as a victim of globalization rather than as its engine.” While others argue there is uncertainty over where U.S. foreign policy is headed — or which country Washington might bomb next — Mr. Twining has been joined by a range of hawkish analysts in praising Mr. Trump’s initial forays. Georgetown University Professor Matthew Kroenig, writing in Foreign Affairs, praised Mr. Trump’s aggressive posture, particularly compared with his predecessor’s. “Trump has begun to correct the failures of the past eight years and position the United States well for the challenges to come,” Mr. Kroenig wrote. “With greater adherence to a core strategy going forward, Trump may well, as [Henry] Kissinger predicted was possible, go ‘down in history as a very considerable president.’” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

U.S. soldiers killed battling Islamic State in Afghanistan
.B
A pair of American soldiers were killed and a third was wounded in Afghanistan during an operation against Islamic State’s faction in the country. The U.S. forces were participating in an Afghan-led raid against known targets tied to Islamic State in Syria and the Levant - Khorasan Group, or ISIL-K, in eastern Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province when the team was ambushed by insurgent fighters. During the ensuing gun battle, the Americans were hit with two succumbing to their injuries. The Pentagon has yet to publicly identify the casualties or which branch of service they belonged. “The fight against [ISIL-K] is important for the world,” Gen. John Nicholson, the to U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “Sadly, it is not without its sacrifices,” he added. The upcoming fighting season “is going to be another tough year for the valiant Afghan security forces and the international troops who have stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with Afghanistan against terrorism,” Defense Secretary James Mattis said during a surprise visit in Kabul Monday. Wednesday’s deaths come amid an uptick by Afghan security forces and their U.S. and coalition counterparts to flush out ISIL-K from its redoubts in Nangahar and elsewhere in eastern Afghanistan. Prior to Wednesday’s attack, U.S. forces had used one of the most powerful, non-nuclear weapons in the American arsenal against ISIL-K targets in Nangahar. It was the first time the 22,000-pound munition, dubbed the “mother of all bombs,” had ever been used in live combat. Its use has raised doubts over the overall direction of the war, with critics questioning why U.S. commanders were forced to use a weapon of that magnitude in a conflict that American and Afghan forces have been fighting for nearly two decades.

The Defense Intelligence Agency explicitly warned Michael Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, about accepting foreign payments without clearance when he retired in 2014, according to new documents released Thursday by a bipartisan congressional investigation into Mr. Flynn’s foreign payments and communications with Russian contacts. In February the retired general resigned after just weeks on the job as Mr. Trump’s top security aide following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his dealings with Russia during the transition from the Obama to Trump administrations — particularly about discussions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The DIA’s exit warning to Mr. Flynn was “bold, italicized and could not have been clearer,” Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told reporters in a Capitol Hill briefing. The briefing came as it emerged the office of the Defense Department’s inspector general was launching its own investigation into why Mr. Flynn failed to get prior approval before accepting payments from foreign interests. Earlier this year, committee investigators revealed that, in 2015, Mr. Flynn was paid over $65,000 by companies linked to Russia, in addition to $530,000 for work his lobbying firm completed, which presumably benefited Turkey. He would later become one of candidate Trump’s closest advisers on foreign and security policy and briefly the head of the hugely influential National Security Council. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that the probe by the Defense Department’s inspector general of Mr. Flynn is “appropriate.” “If they think there’s wrongdoing, then the department’s inspector general should look into that,” Mr. Spicer said. He also defended President Trump’s relationship with his controversial former aide, saying Mr. Flynn had been let go after his deceptions were revealed. “I think the president made the right call at the right time,” Mr. Spicer said. According to Mr. Cummings, the DIA’s Office of General Counsel sent a letter on Oct. 8, 2014, “explicitly warning Flynn, as he entered retirement, that he was prohibited by the Constitution from receiving payments from foreign sources without advance permission.” Two days ago, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Mr. Flynn may have broken the law by not fully disclosing payments he received from Russian TV station RT, which receives funding from the Kremlin. “Our next step is to get the documents we are seeking from the White House so we can complete our investigation,” Mr. Cummings added Thursday. “I thank the Department of Defense for providing us with unclassified versions of these documents.” The committee’s request for a wide range of documents related to Mr. Flynn from the White House was turned down earlier this week. A White House spokesman said the administration does not have documents on Mr. Flynn’s activities prior to Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and those they do have from his time in the administration involve sensitive information. In a statement, Mr. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, declared anew on Thursday that his client briefed DIA officials before and after on his activities, The Associated Press reported. He pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Mr. Cummings, noting that Mr. Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event. The Defense Department, Mr. Kelner contended, “was fully aware of the trip.” However, Mr. Cummings said Thursday that additional declassified documents viewed by the oversight committee had revealed no evidence to support that statement. Mr. Spicer said the Obama administration bore part of the blame for the controversy, because it had renewed Mr. Flynn’s security clearance even though it was aware of the RT payments. He said he wasn’t accusing the Obama administration of wrongdoing, but added, “I’m just making sure people understand the process and how it works.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Schiff, top Democrat on House intelligence committee, offers bill to limit powers in war on terror
.B
The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee introduced a new bill Thursday to revoke the broad war-making powers granted to the president in 2001 and 2002 and to replace them with a much slimmer authorization targeting the Islamic State, al Qaeda and the Taliban. Rep. Adam Schiff’s Authorization for the Use of Military Force would give the president the power to commit ground troops to the fight, but puts a three-year limit on the authorization. “For far too long, Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibility to authorize military action abroad, effectively ceding the war-making power to the executive branch,” said Mr. Schiff in a statement announcing the resolution, which he sponsored along with nine fellow Democrats. President George W. Bush won an AUMF to attack al Qaeda and the Taliban in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, then a year later won authority to oust Saddam Hussein from Iraq. But as the war on terror has expanded to include Libya, Syria, Yemen and other countries, and the focus has shifted from al Qaeda to the Islamic State, legal scholars and a growing number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill say the two original authorizations have been stretched beyond the breaking point. “As deployments to Iraq and Syria increase, and with complicating factors like the recent cruise missile strike against the Assad regime in response to the use of chemical weapons, Congress cannot stand on the sidelines any longer and must debate and vote on any new war,” said Mr. Schiff. “Congress must demand of this Administration and future Administrations the legal justifications for any military action, and hold them accountable for those actions.” For years, Republicans pestered Mr. Obama to revoke the previous AUMFs and come up with a new one. Mr. Obama finally complied in 2015, delivering a severely limited proposal to Capitol Hill — where both Democrats and Republicans quickly shelved it, saying they couldn’t come to a conclusion on how to proceed. Some hawks wanted broader powers to commit troops, while other lawmakers said even Mr. Obama’s limited proposal went too far. It’s not clear that logjam has cleared under President Trump. Meanwhile, Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, joined Mr. Schiff earlier this week in sending President Trump a letter requesting the basis of his legal authority for the airstrike earlier this month in Syria on the Sharat airbase. “It has now been over two weeks since you ordered the strike on the airfield, and your Administration has yet to put forward any detailed legal analyst or justification for that action under domestic and international law,” the letter read.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday President Trump is making a difference with border security and a wall will continue to help. “The president saying that [illegal immigrants are] actually going to be deported has an impact,” Mr. Paxton said on Fox Business. “I think he’s made a difference in changing the narrative.” In addition to deportations, Mr. Paxton said, a wall will continue to help with border security, explaining that fencing put in El Paso, Texas, which borders Mexico on the Rio Grande, helped with safety and decreased illegal border crossings. “Strategically placing walls and fences can help,” he said. Mr. Paxton is currently facing felony security charges and failing to register as an investment adviser with the state. He has dismissed the charges as politically motivated.

Pentagon: blast kills US service member outside Mosul
.B
BAGHDAD (AP) - A U.S. service member in Iraq was killed Saturday by an explosive device outside Mosul, according to a statement released by the Pentagon. The Pentagon said the service member died from wounds sustained in an “explosive device blast,” stating further information would be released as appropriate. Saturday’s incident marks the second American military fatality since the start of the Mosul operation against the Islamic State group more than six months ago. In October, just days after the operation to retake Mosul was formally launched, Navy chief petty officer Jason C. Finan, 34, of Anaheim, California died of wounds sustained in a roadside bomb attack north of Mosul. Finan was part of a team of advisers assisting Iraq’s Kurdish fighters known as the Peshmerga. The Pentagon has acknowledged more than 100 U.S. special operations forces are operating with Iraqi units in and around Mosul, with hundreds more playing a support role in staging bases farther from the front lines. The service member killed Saturday is the fifth combat death in Iraq since the U.S. launched military operations against IS in August 2014. IS fighters began growing in power in Iraq in early 2014 in the country’s west and in the summer of 2014 swept across much of the country’s north. Since the beginning of the U.S. campaign against IS in Iraq, the number of U.S. troops in the country has steadily grown. There are now more U.S. forces in Iraq than any time since the 2011 U.S. withdrawal, marking an intensifying war as Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition work to push IS out of the last pockets of territory the extremists control in Iraq.

Turkey purges 4,000 civil servants, bans TV dating programs
.B
ISTANBUL (AP) - Turkey passed two new decrees Saturday - one that expelled more than 4,000 civil servants and another that banned television dating programs. The country’s Official Gazette published the decrees Saturday evening. The first named thousands of civil servants to be dismissed, including nearly 500 academics and more than 1,000 Turkish military personnel. It also reinstated 236 people to their jobs. The second decree, among other things, banned radio and television programs for “finding friends and spouses” by adding a clause to the article on protecting children in Turkey’s media law. The shows will not be allowed to air without television content rating symbols. Dating programs, which draw high ratings and large ad revenues, have been a hot topic this year. Petitions have called for their bans and lawmakers across the political spectrum have criticized the programs as having a negative influence on families. Government spokesman Numan Kurtulmus has described them as contrary to Turkish customs and religion. The state of emergency that followed last summer’s coup attempt has allowed the Turkish government to rule by decrees. Since then, more than 47,000 people have been arrested and 100,000 have been purged for alleged connections to terror organizations. Turkey says U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen orchestrated the coup attempt. He denies the allegations. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) - U.S. Navy officials say water in two private wells near Naval Air Station Meridian is free of possible contaminants. NAS Meridian sampled the wells from April 17-19 and released preliminary results Friday. NAS Meridian’s commanding officer, Capt. Scott Bunnay, says the examining facility did not detect perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in either sample. The chemicals belong to a larger class of chemicals called perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a component in foam used to fight petroleum fires. PFAS compounds are man-made chemicals that are not absorbed easily in soil and could migrate into groundwater. PFAS has been used since the 1950s in a variety of products such as non-stick cookware and microwaveable popcorn bag food packaging. Bunnay says they expect the final validated results in a couple of weeks. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

High rent may doom Catholic chapel that survived 9/11
.B
NEW YORK (AP) - Parishioners at a New York City chapel that sheltered 9/11 first responders are praying for a miracle to save it from falling victim itself to the prosperity of its resurgent neighborhood. St. Joseph’s Chapel is living on archdiocese subsidies after the rent for the relatively small space tripled in 2014 to $264,000 a year. “If it should disappear and become a Gap or something - nothing against Gap, but it’s really not OK,” said Justine Cuccia, 55, a leader of the effort to save the tiny Roman Catholic chapel, part of the oldest Catholic parish in the state. St. Joseph’s occupies ground-floor space in an apartment complex in Battery Park City, a community fewer than two blocks from the World Trade Center. The chapel is a mission of St. Peter’s Church about a half-mile away, where worshippers will be expected to go if St. Joseph’s closes. Patricia Baumann, who attended midday Mass at St. Joseph’s last week, called the chapel “a special, meaningful place” where her children were baptized and had their first Holy Communions. “I still hope that it will be here for my family,” Baumann said. “But if not, then we’ll go to St. Peter’s.” When the World Trade Center fell, modest St. Joseph’s sat undamaged just outside the rubble zone. Emergency workers and volunteers took out its pews and used the chapel as a command center for several months. Priests celebrated Mass in a tent outside. Rescue workers slept on its floors. St. Joseph’s was rededicated in 2005 as a memorial to those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks, with statues including St. Florian, patron saint of firefighters, and St. Michael the Archangel, patron saint of police officers. “Everything about the space is a 9/11 memorial,” said Cuccia. For the archdiocese, though, it is also a financial drain. The chapel’s rent spiked in 2014 from $80,000 in 2009 as new trade center towers went up and developers competed to build luxury apartments and high-end stores in the area. St. Joseph’s is the only Roman Catholic church in the New York Archdiocese that is a long-term renter, rather than owner, of its space, archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling said. Parishioners are seeking a break on the rent, but Cuccia said the landlord’s offer of a reduction from $80 to $70 per square foot, or about $230,000 a year, is still far more than the parish can pay. A spokeswoman for landlord Gateway said only that Gateway has offered “a significant reduction in rent” to the chapel. According to financial information on the parish website, St. Joseph’s paid $359,000 in rent and real estate taxes and fines in the year ending Aug. 31, 2016 but took in only $164,000 in collections. The parish as a whole, including St. Peter’s, St. Joseph’s and another church, borrowed $540,000 from the archdiocese last year. A statement on the website says the parish’s trustees and finance council “believe that this significant operating loss is not sustainable and that parish expenses must be brought in line with operating revenues.” Parishioners say they fear that means St. Joseph’s will close soon. The Rev. Jarlath Quinn, the pastor, directed questions to Zwilling, who said the archdiocese is “trying to exhaust every option” to keep the chapel open. If it closes, the chapel will join dozens of Catholic churches in New York City that have shut their doors over the last several years as churchgoing has declined. Catholics in lower Manhattan say St. Joseph’s connection to the Sept. 11 terror attacks makes it a special case. “We need this down here, especially after all we’ve been through with 9/11,” Baumann said. Cuccia agreed: “The chapel is some place I come to and pray for the people who died. The church is a place where I can go and find solace and healing, and I really don’t want it to go away.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Pakistan’s army rejects PM Sharif’s call to sack adviser
.B
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan’s army on Saturday rejected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s decision to sack an adviser over his connections to a reporter who wrote an article last year saying there is a rift between civilian and military leaders over efforts to combat militancy. Saturday’s strong reaction from the army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor came shortly after Sharif’s office ordered the firing of Special Assistant on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, without specifying his role in the DAWN newspaper article about a conflict between the military and his government - a sign of escalating tension between the army and the government. In a tweet, Ghafoor said the notification from the office of the prime minister was “incomplete” and “it was not in line with recommendations” made by an inquiry board that was set up to determine who leaked information to journalist Cyril Almeida about a security meeting. Shortly after the army’s response, Sharif addressed two rallies in the cities of Sargodha and Okara in Punjab province but made no mention of the army’s tweet. Sharif said he would not resign, in response to opposition leader Imran Khan’s call for him to step down over alleged corruption. The latest disagreement dates back to last year when Almeida, in a front page article, claimed civil authorities had asked the Inter-Service Intelligence spy agency to act against militants or face international isolation. “In a blunt, orchestrated and unprecedented warning, the civilian government has informed the military leadership of a growing international isolation of Pakistan and sought consensus on several key actions by the state,” Almeida wrote at the time in his article. Sharif’s government quickly rejected his report, saying it was false and fabricated. Sharif’s office in Saturday’s notification said the premier referred Almeida and editor Zafar Abbas to a body of newspaper owners to consider disciplinary action against them. Sharif also ordered action against Rao Tehsin, an official at the Ministry of Information. The notification did not specify Fatemi and Tehsin’s role in the issue, but the military said it has “rejected” the notification. Sharif has already fired his information minister over the issue. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Interior Minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, expressed his displeasure over Ghafoor’s tweet, saying state “institutions don’t talk to each other by tweets.” In a televised news conference Saturday, Khan termed Ghafoor’s tweet “unfortunate” and vowed to take action against those behind the publication of Almeida’s report. He told reporters in Karachi that Sharif was in line with the inquiry board’s recommendations, and that Almeida wants to create mistrust between the army and Pakistan’s civilian leadership. Civil-military relations are a sensitive issue in Pakistan, given the country’s history of military coups. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

The Latest: Pope urges Egypt’s clergy to remain positive
.B
CAIRO (AP) - The Latest on Pope Francis’ visit to Egypt (all times local): 5 p.m. Pope Francis has left Egypt at the end of a historic, two-day visit defined by calls for Christian-Muslim unity against religious militancy. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi saw the Catholic pontiff off at Cairo Airport on Saturday. The visit was partially designed to comfort Egypt’s minority Christians following a spate of deadly attacks since December against their churches. He also attended an international peace conference organized by Al-Azhar, the world’s foremost seat of Sunni Islamic learning. Earlier on Saturday, the pope led an out-door Mass at a military-run stadium attended by some 15,000 Catholic Egyptians. ___ 4 p.m. Pope Francis is telling Egypt’s Catholic priests to stop complaining about the challenges they face and instead work for harmony and dialogue. Francis met with priests, nuns and seminarians at the Roman Catholic National Seminary in Cairo’s leafy suburb of al-Maadi Saturday in the final stop of his quick two-day visit to Egypt. Earlier, he celebrated Mass for the Catholic community, which numbers about 250,000 people among Egypt’s population of 92 million. In his remarks to the clergy, Francis urged them to avoid “temptations” that he frequently rails against among priests: the temptation to complain all the time, to gossip and think priests are better than others. Rather, Francis urged them to lead their flocks and not be dragged down by pessimism and disappointment. He said: “Although there are many reasons to be discouraged, amid many prophets of destruction and condemnation, and so many negative and despairing voices, may you be a positive force.” He said: “May you be sowers of hope, builders of bridges and agents of dialogue and harmony.” ___ 3:45 p.m. Pope Francis is visiting a Catholic seminary college in a Cairo suburb, where he is addressing hundreds of priests, nuns, seminary students and ordinary Catholics in the last stop of his two-day visit to Egypt. The Pope on Saturday entered the facility in the leafy suburb of Maadi in an open-topped golf cart, waving to the hundreds of people gathered to greet him and offering his blessings to small children hoisted forward by their parents. The catholic pontiff earlier Saturday led Mass held at a military-run stadium in another Cairo suburb with about 15,000 people in attendance. Catholics are a tiny minority of Egypt’s estimated 9 million Christians, the vast majority of whom are Orthodox. The pope will directly head to the airport from the seminary to fly. ___ 12:05 p.m. Pope Francis is leaving a military run stadium in Cairo where he led Mass for some 15,000 Egyptian Catholics on the second and final day of a historic visit to Egypt, where Christians have been targeted by Islamic militants. The Mass was conducted in Latin, Italian and Arabic amid scenes of jubilation and tight security, with police out in force and helicopters hovering over the site. Members of the congregation waved Holy See and Egyptian flags and swayed to the music of hymns. Children in ancient Egyptian costumes lined up in front of the makeshift altar in the middle of the grass pitch. The Pope’s visit to mainly Muslim Egypt is meant in part to comfort Egypt’s Christians following a spate of deadly attacks against them by Islamic militants. ___ 10:55 a.m. Pope Francis is urging Egypt’s tiny Catholic community to be good and merciful to their fellow Egyptians, saying “the only fanaticism believers can have is that of charity!” Francis made the comments during Mass on Saturday at the Air Defense Stadium in Cairo on the second and final day of his quick trip to Egypt. On Friday, he comforted Egypt’s Christian community after a spate of attacks by Islamic militants, and demanded that Muslim leaders renounce religious fanaticism that leads to violence. Francis offered a more pastoral tone Saturday in meeting with his own Catholic flock, who number around 250,000. In his homily, he urged them to not be hypocritical in their faith. He said: “God is pleased only by a faith that is proclaimed by our lives, for the only fanaticism believers can have is that of charity!” ___ 10:10 a.m. Pope Francis is leading Mass at a military-run stadium in Cairo with at least 10,000 Egyptian Catholics in attendance amid tight security, including helicopters hovering over the suburban facility. The Saturday Mass is being held on the second and final day of a historic visit to Egypt by the Catholic pontiff, who came to the Muslim majority Arab nation to forge a united Christian-Muslim front against religious militancy and lift the spirits of Egypt’s Christians after a spate of deadly attacks against their churches in December and earlier this month. The atmosphere at the June 30 stadium was cheerful, with members of the congregation swaying to hymns sung by church choruses and waving Egyptian and Vatican flags. Others held yellow balloons, the color of the Vatican flag. ___ 9:40 a.m. Pope Francis has arrived at a military run stadium in an eastern Cairo suburb to lead Mass on his second day of a historic visit to Egypt. The Catholic pontiff arrived in a simple blue Fiat, with his window rolled down, a contrast to the tight security in place for his two-day visit. Organizers say some 25,000 Egyptian Catholics are attending the Mass. Many of them held yellow balloons, the color of the Vatican’s flag. Others waved the yellow-and-white Vatican flags as he rode in an open-roofed golf cart around the stadium after his arrival. The pope’s visit is primarily aimed at forging a united Christian-Islamic front against religious militancy. Catholics are a tiny minority of Egypt’s estimated nine million Christians, who are mostly Orthodox. ___ 9 a.m. Security is exceptionally tight around Cairo and the sports stadium where Pope Francis will celebrate Mass for Egypt’s tiny Catholic community. Both uniformed and plain-clothed police were stationed every meter (yard) or so along Francis’ motorcade route on Saturday, and cars and taxis were prevented from stopping. At the stadium, police used metal detectors to check vehicles for explosives. Others stood guard, some on rooftops, their faces covered. Francis decided to forego the bullet-proof “popemobile” that his predecessors used on foreign trips and drove through Cairo in a simple Fiat. Once in the stadium he plans to greet the crowd in an open golf cart, a reflection of his desire to be close to his flock. The Air Defense Stadium is part of the defense ministry’s sports village. __ 7:30 a.m. Pope Francis will celebrate Mass for Egypt’s tiny Catholic community and meet with its priests and seminarians before returning to Rome. Local media reports say at least 25,000 are expected at Saturday’s Mass in Cairo, which comes on the second day of Francis’ two-day trip to the Arab world’s most populous country Francis on Friday urged Egypt’s Muslim leaders teach a rejection of violence in God’s name during the delicate visit and he strongly backed its uncompromising crackdown on political Islam and militancy. His main event was a landmark visit to Cairo’s Al-Azhar, the revered, 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Islam learning that trains clerics and scholars from around the world. He also met with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Michigan to start major revamp of veterans nursing homes
.B
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan is starting a major revamp of how nursing care is provided to veterans, with plans to ultimately transition from two homes in the western and far-northern regions to seven new, smaller ones spread across the state. The initiative - billed as the most substantial change to the system since the first veterans home opened in Grand Rapids 131 years ago - stems from new, bipartisan state laws that officials say will lead to higher-quality care for more veterans. Talks began last year after a state audit uncovered insufficient care, inadequate staffing levels and other problems at the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans. That home and one in Marquette, which opened in 1981, provide primarily nursing care to more than 500 veterans. They often choose to live there because the government-subsidized care costs them no more than $4,300 a year. The homes also are seen as more equipped to treat a population with higher rates of mental health, substance abuse and behavioral problems than at private facilities. But the large, institutional veterans homes need to be replaced in favor of smaller-scale housing and expanded to other parts of the state, state officials say. “If that were to come to fruition, we would be providing care much closer to where the veterans live now, and their families are going to be closer to them,” said James Redford, who Republican Gov. Rick Snyder named to lead the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency in February 2016 as part of a shakeup after the critical audit was released. He said Snyder told him: “Fix the homes.” In recent weeks, the agency applied for roughly $66 million in federal funding to help build a new home in the Detroit area and to replace and downsize the one in Grand Rapids. A third of the state’s 640,000 veterans live in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. A $42 million state match for the two projects was approved by Snyder and the Legislature months ago. The application also outlines a plan to build five more facilities in phases - first in the Flint/Saginaw/Bay City area, next the Jackson/Battle Creek region, then a replacement of the Marquette home, followed by one in the northern Lower Peninsula and finally another in metro Detroit. Multi-story, hospital-like buildings would be jettisoned for modern houses that are more like a real “home.” Ten to 14 residents in a large house would each have an individual bedroom and bathroom, surrounding a common living and dining area with a kitchen. Overseeing the facilities’ site locations, construction and operations is the new Michigan Veterans’ Facility Authority, which was created under a law enacted in January and whose nine-member board met this past week for the first time. The semi-autonomous authority can issue bonds and solicit donations. Unlike a department or agency, it is more independent from annual budgetary decisions and has more continuity across different governors, said Redford, board chairman. The overhaul comes as veterans homes grapple with rising health care costs, an increasing inability of residents to afford the care and standards that are out of step with best practices within the long-term care industry. A GOP-backed privatization of 170 jobs at the Grand Rapids facility has been panned. And though the state is getting more per-diem reimbursements from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, they are not offsetting declining resident income - meaning the state’s general fund spending is higher. While Michigan’s veteran population is projected to drop by 57 percent to 277,000 by 2043, the percentage of those age 70 and older - those most likely to need care - will increase from a third to nearly half. State officials hope that Michigan’s current and future homes will qualify for additional federal Medicare and Medicaid funding by meeting certain quality standards. “It is our hope that we would be requiring less general funds as we go forward while at the same time providing a substantially improved quality of life and improved places of work for our staff with better facilities,” said Redford, a 28-year Navy veteran who has served as Snyder’s chief legal counsel, a Kent County circuit judge and an assistant U.S. attorney. “Our staff in both these homes, they do remarkable work every day.” For construction of the initial two homes to proceed in 2018 and be done in 2020, Michigan likely needs its federal funding request to rank high - in or near the top 10 - on the VA’s annual priority list. It will be released early next year. U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan is among some in Congress who are pushing to more than triple what is typically allotted for constructing and renovating state homes, to $300 million nationally, said Brad Slagle, interim CEO of the Michigan Veteran Health System. “We think our projects are going to be near that No. 10 spot on the new list,” he said, adding that roughly 150 state veterans homes across the U.S. assist more than 30,000 veterans in need of long-term care - more than the VA does and at a lower cost. “So we think it’s a good investment for the federal government.” ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00.

UAE’s battle-hardened military expands into Africa, Mideast
.B
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - The United Arab Emirates is better known for its skyscrapers and pampered luxuries, but its small size belies a quiet expansion of its battle-hardened military into Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East. The seven-state federation ranks as one of Washington’s most prominent Arab allies in the fight against the Islamic State group, hosting some 5,000 American military personnel, fighter jets and drones. But the practice gunfire echoing through the deserts near bases outside of Dubai and recent military demonstrations in the capital of Abu Dhabi show a country increasingly willing to flex its own muscle amid its suspicions about Iran. Already, the UAE has landed expeditionary forces in Afghanistan and Yemen. Its new overseas bases on the African continent show this country, which U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis calls “Little Sparta,” has even larger ambitions. FROM PROTECTORATE TO PROTECTOR The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, only became a country in 1971. It had been a British protectorate for decades and several of the emirates had their own security forces. The forces merged together into a national military force that took part in the 1991 U.S.-led Gulf War that expelled Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait. The UAE sent troops to Kosovo as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission there starting in 1999, giving its forces valuable experience working alongside Western allies in the field. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it deployed special forces troops in Afghanistan to support the U.S.-led war against the Taliban. Emirati personnel there combined aid with Arab hospitality, working on infrastructure projects in villages and meeting with local elders. Today, the UAE hosts Western forces at its military bases, including American and French troops. Jebel Ali port in Dubai serves as the biggest port of call for the American Navy outside of the United States. BULGING RANKS The UAE decided in recent years to grow its military, in part over concerns about Iran’s resurgence in the region following the nuclear deal with world powers and the Islamic Republic’s involvement in the wars in Syria and Yemen. In 2011, the UAE acknowledged working with private military contractors, including a firm reportedly tied to Blackwater founder Erik Prince, to build up its military. The Associated Press also reported that Prince was involved in a multimillion-dollar program to train troops to fight pirates in Somalia, a program by several Arab countries, including the UAE. “As you would expect of a proactive member of the international community, all engagements of commercial entities by the UAE Armed Forces are compliant with international law and relevant conventions,” Gen. Juma Ali Khalaf al-Hamiri, a senior Emirati military official, said in a statement on the state-run WAM news agency. Media in Colombia have also reported that Colombian nationals working as mercenaries serve in the UAE’s military. In 2014, the UAE introduced mandatory military service for all Emirati males between the ages of 18 to 30. The training is optional for Emirati women. “Our message to the world is a message of peace; the stronger we are, the stronger our message,” Dubai ruler and UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum wrote at the time on Twitter. WAR IN YEMEN In Yemen, UAE troops are fighting alongside Saudi-led forces against Shiite rebels who hold the impoverished Arab country’s capital, Sanaa. Areas where the UAE forces are deployed include Mukalla, the provincial capital of Hadramawt, and the port city of Aden, where the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi is stationed. Additionally, the UAE appears to be building an airstrip on Perim or Mayun Island, a volcanic island in Yemeni territory that sits in a waterway between Eritrea and Djibouti in the strategic Bab al-Mandeb Strait, according to IHS Jane’s Defense Weekly. That strait, some 16-kilometers (10-miles) wide at its narrowest point, links the Red Sea and the Suez Canal with the Gulf of Aden and ultimately the Indian Ocean. Dozens of commercial ships transit the route every day. Already, the waters have seen Emirati and Saudi ships targeted by suspected fire from Yemen’s Shiite rebels known as Houthis. In October, U.S. Navy vessels came under fire as well, sparking American forces to fire missiles in Yemen in its first attack targeting the Houthis in the years-long war there. “More incidents at sea, especially involving civilian shipping, could further internationalize the conflict and spur other actors to intervene,” the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy warned in March. UAE forces and aid organizations have also set foot on Yemen’s Socotra Island, which sits near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, after a deadly cyclone struck it. It too represents a crucial chokepoint and has seen recent attacks from Somali pirates. The UAE has suffered the most wartime casualties in its history in Yemen. The deadliest day came in a September 2015 missile strike on a base that killed over 50 Emirati troops, as well as at least 10 soldiers from Saudi Arabia and five from Bahrain. Meanwhile, Emirati forces were involved in a Jan. 29 Yemen raid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump that killed a U.S. Navy SEAL and 30 others, including women, children and an estimated 14 militants. EXPANDING TO AFRICA Outside of Yemen, the UAE has been building up a military presence in Eritrea at its port in Assab, according to Stratfor, a U.S.-based private intelligence firm. Satellite images show new construction at a once-abandoned airfield the firm links to the Emiratis, as well as development at the port and the deployment of tanks and aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters and drones. “The scale of the undertaking suggests that the UAE military is in Eritrea for more than just a short-term logistical mission supporting operations across the Red Sea,” Stratfor said in December. UAE officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment on its military operations or overseas expansion. South of Eritrea, in Somalia’s breakaway northern territory of Somaliland, authorities agreed in February to allow the UAE open a naval base in the port town of Berbera. Previously, the UAE international ports operator DP World struck a deal to manage Somaliland’s largest port nearby. Further afield, the UAE also has been suspected of conducting airstrikes in Libya and operating at a small air base in the North African country’s east, near the Egyptian border. Meanwhile, Somalia remains a particular focus for the UAE. The Emiratis sent forces to the Horn of Africa country to take part in a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the 1990s, while their elite counterterrorism unit in 2011 rescued a UAE-flagged ship from Somali pirates. The unit has also has been targeted in recent attacks carried out by al-Qaida-linked militants from al-Shabab. A UAE military expansion into Somalia is also possible, as Trump recently approved an expanded military, including more aggressive airstrikes against al-Shabab in the African nation. The UAE recently began a major campaign seek donations for humanitarian aid there. ___ Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Dubai and Maggie Michael in Cairo contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

Pride, fear, lack of info keep veterans from seeking help
.B
GREELEY, Colo. (AP) - John Delgado sleeps in a shed beside a lawnmower and a bike behind a house in Evans. The shed stands about 6 by 8 feet. Delgado, a 65-year-old U.S. Marine and Vietnam veteran, calls it home. He hangs his clothes from a few nails on the wall, and his only light comes from a single, naked light bulb he rigged from the ceiling. When Delgado goes to bed, he climbs past stacks of boxes and outdoor equipment and makes room for his constant companion - a pitbull named Cash. Thin walls and a little insulation are all that separate Delgado from the outside cold. “It’s OK,” he said Thursday. “I like the cold.” Delgado is thankful for the space. He lived on the streets, under bridges and along Greeley’s riverbanks for almost a year. A couple years ago, he met a woman half his age and they became lovers. He calls her his wife and her parents, siblings and nephew live in the house. She’s in prison now, Delgado said. Her family lets him live in the shed. He said it’s hard for him to accept help and even harder to ask for it. It took him nearly a decade after his time in Vietnam to look into his military benefits. He said his machismo and pride got in the way. “I was stupid,” he said. “I didn’t want people to know I was taking a handout.” So now in return for the portion of a backyard storage shed he and his dog call home, he tries to help out around the house, take care of the lawn and pay for the property’s utilities. He moved to Colorado in 2010 with his partner because he found the climate agreed with him and helped soothe his war wounds. His skin used to break out and tear open as sores formed across his body; in Colorado that stopped. So he moved to Greeley. He had a small house and a nice life. After a couple years his partner died. Around the same time he ran through his pain medication, the addictive kind such as oxycodone, a little faster than he should. Then he turned to illegal drugs. The police picked him up with, as he says, $20 of meth in his pocket. He’s still resolving legal problems that stemmed from that. He’s not proud of it, but he doesn’t hide it either - he’ll quickly tell anyone that he’s clean now. That’s when Delgado found himself living on the street. He’d sleep under bridges most of the time, getting food wherever he could around town. He still had some money coming in from military disability and benefits, Delgado said. He would stretch those funds as far as he could, always saving just enough to get him and Cash off the street and into a motel on the coldest winter nights. Veterans Affairs found him a place to stay in Denver - he thinks it was an apartment of some sort. But it didn’t allow dogs, and Cash was the only link he still had to his old life with his partner. He refused to say goodbye. “You give up your son, then I’ll give up my dog,” he said. Delgado’s story isn’t much different than a handful of veterans who are homeless in the Greeley area. His reasons for getting there, pride and fear, aren’t much different either. Homeless vets do have a much wider variety of resources available to get them off the street. But for those reasons, and others, many don’t use them. A CHALLENGE Melanie Falvo, United Way director of community impact, is chairwoman of a collaborative effort between Weld and Larimer County agencies that works to address the issue of homeless vets in their region. It’s a new group that started this past year during a push from the governor’s office. In a little more than 12 months, the organization had identified 261 veterans experiencing homelessness in Weld and Larimer, she said. They’ve managed to find places for 121 of them. From January through March this year, the group identified 43 homeless veterans and managed to house 28 of them, Falvo said. Some homeless veterans don’t want help, and they can become what professionals call chronically homeless - those who spend years living on the street or without a home. Some veterans prefer that kind of life. Of the 261 homeless veterans the group identified, 41 are inactive - which can mean anything from moving away, ending up in jail or just dropping off the grid. Wesley Waldvogle is chronically homeless. He served in the Army, but only for a handful of months before his actions required his early departure from the military. He doesn’t identify as a veteran, but he’ll go to events for homeless veterans, and sometimes he’ll stand in Greeley with his cardboard sign proclaiming “homeless vet, please help.” Waldvogle doesn’t want a house, a normal job or a lot of money. He wants to live on the land and make just enough to get by. Maybe if he had a car, he would visit his daughter, but that’s all he wants. He said the life he sees most people aspire to isn’t for him. But most veterans do want to find a job, a place to live and a sense of stability. Most want a home. “They don’t want to be homeless. They’re not lazy,” said Weld County Veteran Services Supervisor Deon Harris. Getting a homeless veteran into a home is the ideal solution. But getting them to ask for that help, or even realizing it’s available, can be challenging. LACK OF INFORMATION When Harris was discharged from the Army, he got a course on adapting to civilian life - that’s what military folk call normal, non-military living - and his veteran’s benefits. The brief explanation, a two-week course, wasn’t nearly enough, he said. “They teach us to be soldiers,” Harris said, “but they don’t teach us how to be a civilian.” A lot of folks join the military with nothing more than a bag of clothes and a couple possessions. When they get out of the military, if they don’t have a spouse or family members to lean on for help, they can wind up in a tough spot. “We leave homeless, jobless and without insurance,” Harris said. “And it’s up to us to pick up all the pieces at once. And if you’re single, young and immature, that makes it harder.” Christopher Aguilar, a transition and care manger with Veterans Affairs who serves the northern Colorado area, said he deals with many veterans who don’t receive care that could help them live a comfortable and healthy life because they don’t know what’s out there. “One of the things that is becoming apparent to me is a lack of information,” he said. When he explains to veterans the help they could receive, the benefits they could qualify for he often hears some version of “this is the first I’ve heard of it.” “I think a lack of information leads to poor choices,” Aguilar said. Harrison Swift, a U.S. Marine combat veteran, works with Volunteers of America. He’s a veteran specialist with Supportive Services for Veteran Families - a program funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “The (Marines) didn’t really prepare me for the outside world,” he said. “They showed me how to do a resume, but they didn’t explain to me what it would really be like when I got out of the service, looking for a job, how to deal with chronic pain - if you have it - or how to deal with certain mental issues.” MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES Even down the road, veterans who find a support system in family, friends or a marriage can find themselves in need of help if those supports systems fail or weaken. Some might find themselves dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to other injuries they sustained during their service, and they can turn to drugs or alcohol to help soothe those issues. “I think mental health and substance abuse issues really in most cases - not in all - do go hand-in-hand,” Aguilar said. If a veteran has mental health challenges and self-medicates with alcohol or drugs, it can be far more difficult for them to find housing, Aguilar said. He even thinks many services have policies against those who use drugs. “We find, in order for folks to keep housing, the more engaged they are with substance abuse or mental health programs, the more successful they can be,” he said. Substance abuse or mental health challenges aren’t unique to homeless veterans, he said, and it’s not true in all cases. People can end up homeless without any mental health or substance abuse issues. “But it is pretty prevalent in most cases,” he said. Even those who end their military career without PTSD or any other mental challenges may still have to confront the stigma of mental illness that can accompany their veteran status, making them feel ostracized, Aguilar said, and unwilling to reach out to others for help. “When they find out the individual is a veteran, I think sometimes an initial reaction for some people is ‘I wonder if they have PTSD, or I wonder if they’re really close to losing it,’” he said. “I hear that from the veterans I work with.” Sadly, those assumptions can lead to actual mental health issues, he said. “It can be isolating,” he said, “and then you’ve got that vicious cycle. You’ve got that isolation factor that you find in a lot diagnoses that we’re treating - depression, PTSD, anxiety and an assortment of panic disorders.” American Legion Post 18 Commander Jim Hartshorn and the other members of Greeley’s American Legion Post meet with veterans, hear their stories and try to find them help. The goal is to find them a place to stay so they can build a routine and create some stability or even a normal life. That’s probably the biggest issue for some young veterans, he said. When they’re in the military, they’re used to having their life, day and schedule planned for them. When they get out of the military they’re often left all on their own. “We haven’t taught them to weigh the imperatives of a decision,” Hartshorn said. “They were assigned tasks. They don’t know how to make the adjustment (to civilian life). They don’t have the structure.” When someone is used to, or conditioned for, structure loses it, he said it can create a lot of anxiety in veterans. Leaving the military, a job or a spouse means losing that structure. Many times, that’s why their life falls apart. And losing their home soon follows. ACCEPTING THE HELP Richard Mariani, an Army veteran, isn’t homeless anymore. But he’s quick to remember when his marriage ended, and he spent about a year living out of a storage unit or in a tent behind his brother’s house. He never went to ask for help. He knew he might qualify for something, but the idea he might not, that he might get rejected, was too scary. His self-esteem couldn’t take any more hits. He was already homeless, and the idea he might not be good enough for benefits, might have done something else wrong in his life, was too much to take. “The Army taught me to take care of myself,” he said. That’s how he sees it. Living in a storage unit or in a tent, no matter how uncomfortable, was taking care of himself. In the cold Greeley winter, in a tent behind his brother’s house that pride held out. If Harris can only get veterans through his office door, he’ll do everything in his power to find a way to help them. If veteran services can’t help, he connects them with other groups in the community who can. There is help available. He just has to get them to accept it. When they do, there can be some great success stories. Swift remembers a veteran he managed to help find a place to live recently. “I had a veteran who was homeless, struggling and depressed,” he recounted. When he got into an apartment, he started looking for jobs. He’s off the street, he takes care of himself and he’s able to get to his appointments. It’s like a light turned on.” “You need your roots somewhere,” Swift said. “Once (veterans) have that, they feel like they can branch out, join the VFW or the American Legion and join the community.” ___ Information from: The Tribune of Greeley, Co, http://greeleytribune.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

EXCHANGE: Advocacy helps mother cope with son’s suicide
.B
QUINCY, Ill. (AP) - A lifetime of advocating for others has helped Dawn Whitcomb open up about and cope with her son’s suicide. Whitcomb grew up in Payson and began working at the Illinois Veterans Home as a student worker while attending Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Mo. “Just being around those veterans and hearing their stories … even at 22, I knew I needed to see what else was out there, so I joined the Navy,” she said. “I was a pom-pom girl. When I came home and told my roommate I’d joined the military, she couldn’t believe it. It was something I’d kind of thought about, but I knew if I didn’t just do it now, I never would. I was on that bus to St. Louis, and I kept thinking, ‘What am I doing?’ “ Her service helped her develop focus. Her final duty station was at Naval Air Station Miramara in California with the Naval Alcohol Rehabilitation Center, a 28-day program for active-duty service members. “I was an in-taker, so I did a lot of the patient histories,” she said. “As a corpsman, I could have been placed anywhere. I could have been in a hospital, with the Marines working sick call, anything. “I did hear a lot of very sad stories. A lot of abuse. They would come in there and get open and honest. It opened my eyes. The whole military experience opened my eyes. I was exposed to different cultures, different backgrounds, and it made me appreciate where I came from.” She received a bachelor’s degree in health care administration while in the military and met her first husband. The couple moved back to Quincy after their enlistments ended. “My first job out was at a place called Life Skills Center in Hannibal,” she said. “I worked there as a (partial hospitalization) therapist. We worked with the chronic mentally ill, teaching them life skills. Most of the clients were schizophrenics. Most of them were medicated, but it depended on the day. There were outbursts every once in a while. “I had worked on the psych unit at Bremerton Naval Hospital. I would get home, and I would think about these patients a lot. How do you not? I learned that by taking my uniform off every night before I left the hospital and putting my civilian clothes back on, that was kind of a symbolic thing. I’m leaving it here, and now I’m going home.” After two years at Life Skills Center, she accepted a job at the Illinois Veterans Home. From 1996 to 2002, she was an activity therapist there. She then transitioned to the adjutant’s office as a staff member, and in 2010 became the adjutant. “I loved being an advocate for the veterans,” she said. “When you’re raised by a nurse, you tend to lean to the helping field, and that’s what I did.” When her son Dylan Muldoon was 2, she and her husband divorced. In 2002, she married Charles Whitcomb, a South African immigrant. “We met skydiving,” she said. “He’s a tandem instructor. It was at the World Freefall Convention. We struck up a friendship, emailed back and forth, and I eventually went to visit him in South Africa. He had been offered a job to come here and work. It was kind of odd, but it worked out.” The marriage gave Dylan cultural awareness and an opportunity to travel to foreign countries. “Dylan was a great kid,” she said. “He didn’t know a stranger. He was always very comfortable around adults. I could take him anywhere, and he would strike up a conversation with somebody. “He was very active. He was always outside, jumping over something, ramping something. He did football, wrestling, cross country, the hockey league out at Scottie’s (Fun Spot) and the hockey league at the Crossing. He was involved in a lot.” Whitcomb found her son after he committed suicide at 18 in November 2015, and she now suffers from PTSD. A breast cancer survivor, she had been an advocate for that cause. After Dylan’s death, her focus shifted. “I didn’t know anybody that had died by suicide,” she said. “To have my own child do it and to wrap my brain around it was one thing, but to talk about it was another.” Shortly after Dylan’s death, another student from his school took their own life. “There’s a support group here in town for people who have lost a loved one to suicide,” Whitcomb said. “I called another support group member and said, ‘I’m going to the high school. This was only three months after they lost their friend Dylan, and they were reliving all that. I sat with students most of that day and tried to comfort them as best as I could. “I want a purpose out of Dylan’s death. I have to find one. It’s about helping others. I choose to talk about my grief. That’s how I deal with it. There’s no set pattern to the five stages of grief. I know I’ve probably experienced all of them, but not in any one set sequence.” It is still difficult for her, but she tries to always walk through the pain, rather than avoid it. “Every morning, I get up, get out of bed, and I put one foot in front of the other,” she said. “I go to work, and I do my job to the best of my ability. I honor my son every day by remembering him. “I want him to be remembered as the fun-loving kid that everybody knew. So many people came through his visitation and said he was always the kid that came in and cheered me up. In retrospect, Dylan was sad inside. A lot like Robin Williams, always putting himself out there.” She is slowly starting to find joy in life again, but she says the grief will never leave. She describes it as an unavoidable wave that knocks her down when it comes on. It can be spurred by a seeing a particular kind of cereal or hearing a song on the radio. “I used to believe God doesn’t give us more than we can handle,” she said. “I don’t know. My whole perspective on life has kind of changed. I used to believe things happen for a reason. I don’t know if there’s any reason to Dylan’s death, but can I make something out of it? Can I find purpose in it? Absolutely.” ___ Source: The Quincy Herald-Whig, http://bit.ly/2ovAPKf ___ Information from: The Quincy Herald-Whig, http://www.whig.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Timeline: President Trump vs. North Korea
.B
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A North Korean missile launch Saturday is the latest development in an ongoing game of brinkmanship this year with President Donald Trump’s new U.S. administration. A look at key moments this year: Jan. 1: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says in a New Year’s address that North Korean preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have “reached the final stage.” ___ Jan. 2: Trump, then president-elect, tweets: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!” ___ Jan. 20: Trump inaugurated as president. ___ Feb. 12: North Korea tests a new midrange ballistic missile in its first major challenge to Trump as president. It says the missile used solid fuel, an advance that would increase a weapon’s mobility and make it harder for outsiders to detect a coming launch. ___ March 6: North Korea fires four ballistic missiles that fly about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), with three of them landing in waters near Japan. It later says it was simulating nuclear strikes on U.S. military bases in Japan. ___ March 19: North Korea conducts a ground test of a new high-thrust rocket engine it describes as a breakthrough in the country’s space program and efforts to develop strategic weapons. ___ April 5: North Korea fires a missile from its east coast on the eve of a summit meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The missile only flies about 60 kilometers (40 miles) before falling into the sea. __ April 6: Trump orders a missile strike on a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapon attack. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later says the move carries a message for any nation operating outside of international norms. He doesn’t specify North Korea, but the context is clear. ___ April 12: Trump says in a televised interview that the U.S. is sending “an armada” of vessels to the Korean peninsula, after the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group is ordered to head there from Singapore. The move further fans fears in some quarters that Trump is weighing military action. ___ April 14: The Trump administration settles on its North Korea strategy after a two-month review: “Maximum pressure and engagement.” The announcement seems to rule out immediate military intervention, though U.S. officials continue to say that all options are on the table. ___ April 15: North Korea marks the birth anniversary of founder Kim Il Sung with a massive military parade that includes previously unseen rocket canisters and launcher trucks. Analysts say the large canisters and trucks point to the development of new intercontinental ballistic missiles and launch systems. ___ April 16: North Korea fires a missile from an eastern coastal area, but the launch apparently fails. U.S. officials say that the missile was likely a KN-17, a new Scud-type missile that North Korea is developing. ___ April 25: North Korea holds a major live-fire drill - but not a nuclear or intercontinental missile test - on the anniversary of the founding of its military. The exercise on its east coast includes more than 300 large-caliber artillery pieces and torpedo-attacks on mock enemy warships, according to its state media. ___ April 28: Tillerson chairs a U.N. Security Council meeting in which the United States and China offer starkly different strategies for addressing the North Korean nuclear threat. ___ April 29: South Korean and U.S. officials say a North Korean midrange ballistic missile, presumably a KN-17, failed shortly after launch.

Trump moves to reverse Obama limits on offshore drilling
.B
President Trump on Friday will begin to reverse his predecessor’s limits on new offshore drilling, potentially opening up vast new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf for oil-and-gas exploration. White House officials said Mr. Trump will sign an executive order directing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review all aspects of the nation’s offshore drilling regulations. As part of that review, Mr. Zinke will examine President Obama’s five-year ban on any new offshore leases, which would have lasted through 2022, and will make recommendations on whether to open up new areas in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans to drilling, as well as new waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The order also will temporarily prohibit the designation of any new marine monuments off U.S. shores, ending an Obama-era practice of using the century-old Antiquities Act to protect waters from drilling. In justifying the new policy — which came under immediate, scathing attacks from environmentalists and Democrats on Capitol Hill — Mr. Zinke told reporters Thursday night that federal revenue from offshore drilling has dropped from $18 billion in 2008 to just $2.8 billion in 2016. Some of that drop can be attributed to drops in the price of oil, but the Trump administration argues much of it is due to federal regulation. Mr. Zinke said there are both economic and environmental benefits to expanding offshore drilling, and he rejected outright the notion that the U.S. should curb energy exploration solely out of concern for the environment. “It is better to produce energy here under reasonable regulations than to have it be produced overseas with no regulations,” he said. “Environmentally, I can tell you we have the highest standards in the world, and if you doubt that, I invite you to visit some of the energy opportunities in the Middle East and Africa, which are catastrophes as far as the environment is concerned.” The executive order does not immediately open up new areas for drilling, nor does it have any impact on existing oil-and-gas company leases off of U.S. shores. Still, the very idea of expanding offshore drilling ignited a firestorm among Trump critics. Environmentalists pointed to past drilling disasters, such as the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, to argue that allowing even more energy exploration is a foolish move. “Seven years, almost to the day, after offshore drilling caused the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, President Trump is taking aim at expanding this dirty and dangerous industry into new areas like the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans, as well as the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Let me be clear: that would be a huge, bad, stupid mistake,” said Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, a leading conservation group. “I doubt President Trump would want to see Mar-a-Lago, or any of his other coastal resorts, covered in oil.” Ahead of Friday’s official announcement, a coalition of 27 Senate Democrats on Thursday wrote a letter to Mr. Zinke urging him to scrap the plan. They said that current leasing plans will provide more than enough fuel, and they charged that oil companies are doing nothing with some of the leases they already hold. Existing policy “already makes available more than 45 billion barrels of oil for drilling. It makes available more than half of all known oil and natural gas resources on federal lands offshore,” the Democratic lawmakers wrote. “Extracting and burning even these fossil resources would already be disastrous for our climate. But when oil companies are currently holding and warehousing leases … we should first ensure that they are taking full advantage of the areas that are already available before contemplating opening new areas to oil drilling and the threat of a spill.” Energy companies reject that charge and say that not all of the areas they lease contain recoverable fuel. As for environmentalists’ fears, Mr. Zinke said there are legitimate concerns with offshore drilling that must and will be addressed. He didn’t specifically mention the BP spill in 2010 or other environmental disasters, but he vowed that the administration will not expand offshore exploration without first ensuring it can be done safely. “The truth is, we can expect during the review process we will find ways to look at our regulatory requirements that strengthen our safety and environmental policies,” the secretary said.

Trump threatens to terminate NAFTA unless U.S. gets a winning deal

President Trump said Thursday he was giving Mexico and Canada a chance to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, but warned them that he was ready to pull out if it wasn’t rewritten as a winning deal for the U.S. In backing away from the NAFTA exit, Mr. Trump nevertheless checked off a top item on his 100-day agenda by forcing Mexico and Canada to the bargaining table over the three-country trade deal that has been the bane of the president’s blue-collar base. The maneuver even won begrudging support from Mr. Trump’s foes within the Republican establishment, who admitted the decades-old free trade zone needed to be updated. “I decided rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,” said Mr. Trump. “If I’m unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we’re going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.” The administration had been preparing to quit the deal using an escape clause known as Article 2205. That prompted Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call Mr. Trump and ask instead for a NAFTA redo. “We have to make a deal that is fair for the United States. They understand that,” said Mr. Trump in the Oval Office while meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. Mr. Trump stressed that he was still willing to quit the deal. He later added that the renegotiations were already underway. “It’ll start very soon. It’s actually starting today,” he said. Fixing NAFTA or getting the U.S. out of it was a prominent campaign promise for Mr. Trump. It topped his 100-day agenda for action to protect American workers that he promoted during the race. Since taking effect in 1994, the free trade zone created by NAFTA has been blamed for the rapid decline of American manufacturing and job losses as companies moved factories to lower-wage Mexico. It’s also blamed for suppressing U.S. wages. Mr. Trump’s tough talk on trade and NAFTA in particular helped fuel his support across the Rust Belt, which sealed his victory in November. Tackling NAFTA followed a series of get-tough moves on trade by the Trump administration, including slapping tariffs on Canadian soft lumber exports and launching investigations of imported steel and aluminum. The administration was ready to begin the exit from NAFTA within days. Under Article 2205, which allows any of the parties to unilaterally drop out, the exit would have been completed in six months. Mr. Pena Nieto and Mr. Trudeau phoned the White House Wednesday evening to ask Mr. Trump to enter talks on NAFTA rather than quit, a move that would have left America’s neighbors in an economic lurch. Mr. Trump said his “very good” relationships with Mr. Pena Nieto and Mr. Trudeau, as well as his respect for their countries, prompted him to give renegotiation a chance. He said he told them “let’s see if we can make it a fair deal, because NAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States. It’s been very good for Canada. It’s been very good for Mexico. But it has been horrible for the United States.” Mexico and Canada gave a more subdued description of the call, but all the parties said the result was consensus on the need to “modernize” NAFTA. “During the call, both Presidents spoke of the shared goal of modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement,” said a statement form Mr. Pena Nieto’s office. “The leaders agreed on the advisability of maintaining the North American Free Trade Agreement and working with Canada to carry out a successful renegotiation for the benefit of the three countries.” NAFTA hasn’t been all bad for the U.S. About one-third of all U.S. merchandise exports go to Mexico and Canada, and exports from American service industries and from the agriculture sector increased dramatically under the agreement, noted the conservative Club for Growth, which advocates free trade policies. The proposed U.S. pullout also faced resistance from free trade Republicans in Congress. “We should improve NAFTA, not abandon it,” Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said on the Senate floor after Mr. Trump’s announcement. He pointed to Arizona’s flourishing trade with Mexico, which exceeded $15 billion in 2016 and supports about 100,000 jobs in the Grand Canyon State. “The bottom line is that trade is good for American businesses, it’s good for American workers, and it’s good for American consumers,” he said. “Trade is not a zero-sum game where one party wins and the other party loses. Free trade benefits everyone. I hope that we remember this as we look toward NAFTA’s future.” Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Mr. Trump was taking the right approach in moving cautiously to revamp “a complex set of institutional and economic relationships that have developed over the past 25 years.” “NAFTA has created millions of U.S. jobs that are now dependent on that trade. However, as technological advances and shifting global dynamics reshaped the business landscape, NAFTA has remained largely unchanged,” he said. “We commend the administration’s intent to update and reform NAFTA to ensure that U.S. interests and workers are protected, and to bolster our competitiveness. However, we should remain cautious about taking extreme steps that could damage American businesses and the overall U.S. economy,” said Mr. Grumet. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

How Bayern claimed its 5th straight Bundesliga title
.B
BERLIN (AP) - No team had ever won the Bundesliga more than three times in a row before Bayern Munich extended it to four last year. Now make that five. As expected, the Bavarian powerhouse extended its record with its fifth straight title Saturday, beating Wolfsburg 6-0 away to wrap up its 27th German championship overall with three games to go. How did Bayern do it and what makes the club so dominant in Germany? Here are a few reasons: ___ BEST SQUAD After taking over from Pep Guardiola last summer, Carlo Ancelotti inherited a squad of Germany’s World Cup winners such as Thomas Mueller, Philipp Lahm and Jerome Boateng, as well as stars like Robert Lewandowski, Thiago Alcantara, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. Germany defender Mats Hummels arrived from league rival Borussia Dortmund, and exciting Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches from Benfica. Ancelotti has had enviable talent at his disposal, with some of his stars forced to spend time on the substitutes’ bench due to the fierce competition for places. ___ A GREAT START Ancelotti began his tenure with seven victories across all competitions - the best start ever for a new Bayern coach - and didn’t taste defeat in the Bundesliga until a 1-0 defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund in the 11th round. It proved to be just one of two defeats on the way to the title. ___ LATE GOALS Bayern was able to dig itself out of trouble with narrow victories and late goals maintaining its title push when it seemed the side’s intensity had dropped after Christmas. Lewandowski scored in injury time for a 2-1 win at Freiburg, Manuel Neuer made a number of saves to secure a 2-1 victory at Werder Bremen, and another injury-time goal from Lewandowski - in the 96th minute - salvaged a 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin. Other sides complain of Bayern’s “luck” but it’s the undying will to win that pushes the side to the very end of games. ___ FINANCIAL CLOUT Much is made of Wolfsburg’s backing by Volkswagen, Bayer Leverkusen by the pharmaceutical company, or Leipzig by an energy drinks company, but Bayern can count on the backing of three major partners: sportswear giant Adidas, insurance company Allianz, and car-maker Audi. They each hold an 8.33 percent stake in the club, which boasts revenues unrivaled among any other side in Germany. ___ HARD WORK Money and players alone aren’t enough to win the championship. Bayern dug deep when it had to, turning draws into narrow wins and defeats into draws. Ancelotti’s patient approach has been appreciated by his players, who were given more freedom than under predecessor Pep Guardiola. The Italian coach has an excellent backroom team including assistant coaches Hermann Gerland and Davide Ancelotti (his son), technical director Michael Reschke. Perhaps even more importantly, Ancelotti can count on unwavering support from club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and president Uli Hoeness. ___ POOR COMPETITION While Wolfsburg offered no resistance on Saturday, the fact that a promoted side, Leipzig, was the one to push Ancelotti’s team the hardest says a lot about the level of competition Bayern faces on a regular basis in the Bundesliga. Dortmund’s challenge faded due to inconsistency, and expected challengers like Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg and Schalke all faltered badly. Schalke started with five defeats, while the others are still fighting relegation. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Three university students are suing an art and design school scheduled for closing and its parent company. The lawsuit filed Thursday cites fraud and breach of contract after Santa Fe University of Art and Design decided to closing following the spring 2018 semester. The school’s closure was announced mid-April. Santa Fe attorney Ben Allison who represents the students says the action by the school shows their interest in profit over students. The lawsuit states that Laureate Education Inc., which owns the school, intentionally left students and faculty in a vulnerable position. SFUAD spokeswoman Rachael Lighty could not comment on legal matters, but says a number of transfer agreements are in place. It is unclear what amount in compensation for damages the lawsuit seeks.

That’s according to MassBenchmarks, a journal of the state’s economy published by the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. The economists say the state’s performance was “surprisingly weak,” with the gross domestic product declining at an estimated annual rate of 0.5 percent during the first three months of 2017. It marked the second straight quarter that Massachusetts lagged behind the nation as a whole. According to the Commerce Department, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in first quarter of this year, the weakest performance in three years.

The Texas Department of Public Safety told the Austin American-Statesman that about 3,500 people participated in a rally Saturday in Austin - part of nationwide marches calling for climate action. People marched from the Capitol to the University of Texas. Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett was among the speakers who addressed the crowd. Many held signs with slogans such as “Climate change is not fake science.” Hundreds more gathered in Houston, where Mayor Sylvester Turner told participants that climate change is “very much real.” ___ 4:45 p.m. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says climate marches taking place around the country are part of a fight for the future of the planet. The former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination addressed an adoring crowd of about 3,000 people who turned out for a rally at the Vermont Statehouse in Montpelier. Sanders went through a litany of climate woes, including rising temperatures and increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He said the fossil fuel industry puts short-term profits ahead of the best interests of the planet. But he also noted a series of accomplishments that include ever-dropping costs of renewable energy production and well-paying jobs in renewable power. ___ 2:30 p.m. While climate marchers in Washington, D.C., contend with sweltering heat, their counterparts in Denver got a dose of spring snow. Several hundred people marched near the Colorado Capitol and then posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph Saturday as wet snow fell. A few snowmen held signs in Civic Center Park across from Denver’s City Hall during a rally after the march. About a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. Some booed when a speaker noted that it was President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office, but the overall mood was relaxed. The marches were among more than 300 taking place around the country to call for action to combat climate change. ___ 4 p.m. Speakers at climate rallies in New England are focusing on the danger climate change poses to coastal communities and on how marginalized groups have fewer financial resources to help them deal with the effects. At a demonstration that drew thousands of people to Boston Common, the Rev. Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told the crowd, “We are here because there is no Planet B.” More than 2,000 people came to the Maine State House in Augusta during the day’s rally. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was expected to speak at a march in Montpelier. The marches were among more than 300 taking place around the country. The events coincided with President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office and take aim at his rollback of environmental protections. ___ 1:30 p.m. Thousands of people across the U.S. are marking President Donald Trump’s hundredth day in office by marching in protest of his environmental policies. In Washington, D.C., large crowds on Saturday were making their way down Pennsylvania Avenue, where they planned to encircle the White House. Organizers say about 300 other protest marches are expected around the country. Participants in the Peoples Climate March say they’re objecting to Trump’s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things. In Augusta, Maine, protesters outside the statehouse said they wanted to draw attention to the damage climate change can cause marginalized communities. A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.

AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - The state says that lottery sales rose to $271 million last year. That’s up from $228 million in 2012. A new report by the Legislature’s Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability found a new $25 game ticket might explain the bump. Lawmakers asked for the report following media investigations raising questions about marketing the lottery in low-income communities. The report found that more-populated Maine counties often have more lottery sales and winnings. But rural Kennebec and Washington counties represent an outsized percentage of sales and winnings. Knox County saw an 81 percent increase in winnings. The report found the state lottery and liquor agency isn’t providing annual reports or monthly lottery statements as required by statute.

SANTA FE, N.M.

The proposed Orogrande garnet mine was expected bring $160 million in economic development to Otero County and Alamogordo. Businessman Daniel Burrell said Friday that the project was simply halted, and not abandoned as the Alamogordo mayor had thought, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported (http://bit.ly/2qgGLHM). Market issues related to the price of garnet forced the setback, he said. “We’ve made a very substantial investment in the project thus far,” Burrell said. “We’re moving slower than anticipated because we think that’s the appropriate thing to do.” County commissioners held a meeting mid-April to get an update on the mine, but the minutes of the meeting were not been released as of last Sunday. Commissioner Janet White declined to comment on the meeting. Burrell said communication with Otero County leaders has been lacking. Burrell said he plans on giving public officials an update in the near future.  “I am going to be reaching out to any number of folks to ensure the communication is appropriate, that we have not abandoned the project in any way,” he said. ___ Information from: The Santa Fe New Mexican, http://www.sfnewmexican.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Iowa’s largest utility aims to produce only renewable energy
.B
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Iowa’s largest utility is in the midst of a $3.6 billion investment in wind power and intends to keep spending on the towers with a goal of producing 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources. MidAmerican Energy plans to build 1,000 more turbines over the next couple of years on top of the more than 2,000 it already has around the state, The Des Moines Register (http://dmreg.co/2q8SIPq ) reported. When it’s completed, the utility’s share of its energy that comes from renewable sources will jump from 55 percent to nearly 90 percent. “It would set a new precedent for the U.S.,” said Daniel Shurey, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “It will require a company that really knows what it’s doing. It will be challenging for them to provide security of supply, and that’s not something MidAmerican will take lightly.” CEO Bill Fehrman says it’ll take about $2 billion and 550 turbines more to bring MidAmerican close to 100 percent. He said wind energy helps keep electricity costs down, adding that MidAmerican has agreed to freeze rates until at least 2029. “There’s not another utility in the country - gas, water, cable, electric - that’s held rates steady for 12, 13 years,” Fehrman said. He said MidAmerican’s rates have increased only once since 1998. They’re the ninth-lowest in the country. “A lot of that is because of the wind investment,” Fehrman said. “The beauty of wind is there’s no fuel costs. We will be able to virtually serve 89 percent of our customers’ needs with an energy resource that requires no fuel.” Iowa’s other big power producer, Cedar Rapids-based Alliant Energy, expects its wind energy share will grow to about 30 percent within seven years. Shurey said utilities are investing a lot in wind now because of the federal production tax credits. The subsidies are expected to phase out by 2020. ___ Information from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

MINOT, N.D. (AP) - Property values are on the decline in North Dakota’s fourth-largest city. The greatest drop in valuations is occurring with Minot’s apartment and hotel properties due to the decline in the oil industry, the Minot Daily News (http://bit.ly/2oFf6Nh ) reported. “This would be the first time in recent record keeping or memory where we have seen a significant drop in market value from the prior year,” said City Assessor Kevin Terne. An annual report of the Minot City Assessor’s Office said the median residential assessment dropped 4 percent with about $182,000 compared to $190,000 in 2016. Apartment buildings dropped 15 percent in assessment values last year and are expected to drop another 20 to 30 percent for 2017. Minot’s 33 hotels fell 20 percent in 2016 and are also expected to drop at least 30 percent this year. Apartments account for about 26 percent of the city’s occupancy, and hotels make up about 6 percent. Minot’s citywide property valuation of $4.5 billion has also dropped 7 percent from last year. The report showed more housing options were below the $200,000 level than last year, a benefit for homebuyers. The report also said that in 2016 homes lasted on the market for 113, about 15 more day than 2015; the city appropriated about $1 million in property tax value, 30 percent less than 2015; and new taxable residential construction was 50 percent less than in 2015. ___ Information from: Minot Daily News, http://www.minotdailynews.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Aging farmers in Wisconsin fear nursing care may cost farm
.B
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Aging farmers are growing more concerned about what happens to the family farm once they’re gone. The Wisconsin Farm Center’s economic development consultant, Frank Friar, told Wisconsin Public Radio (http://bit.ly/2oGshAO) it has helped develop about 200 transition plans with farmers over the past couple of years. The majority are concerned about what happens if they end up in a nursing home. “If they’ve had parents in a nursing home, they know some of the consequences. They’ve watched their savings dwindle away. It’s a difficult situation,” Friar said. “They want to pay their own way and be good citizens, but they don’t want to lose the farm in doing it.” Attorney George Twohig advises producers on transferring farms to the next generation. He said many farmers are tight on cash but have a lot of assets. “So they become concerned that real estate would have to be sold to pay for the cost of long-term care,” Twohig said. Twohig said many people are considering Medicaid trusts, where farmers divest their assets to protect the farm. “If we divest the assets, give them away and reduce the person’s assets down to where they qualify for medical assistance, the idea is that eventually they will qualify to have the government pay for long-term care,” he said. He said the trusts are sometimes a good solution but not a cure-all. Some farmers are pursuing other options, such as purchasing life insurance or long-term care insurance, to protect the farm from asset recovery related to health care costs. ___ Information from: Wisconsin Public Radio, http://www.wpr.org Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Report: Federal utility edited 3rd-party nuke plant reviews
.B
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The nation’s largest public utility suppressed some negative findings about the work environment at one of its nuclear plants in Tennessee, according to a report ordered by the agency’s inspector general. The Knoxville News Sentinel reports (http://bit.ly/2qgBtvI ) that Tennessee Valley Authority’s inspector general hired a consultant to review the work environment at the Watts Bar nuclear plant following concerns brought up in March 2016 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC found that employees feared harassment, intimidation and retaliation for raising safety concerns at the plant. The NTD Consulting Group said in its report that managers told investigators that some findings were left out of reports for fear a second reactor would not get licensed. The plant is located near Spring City, Tennessee. In 2015, a confidential informant’s tip about the plant’s work environment triggered an investigation by two consultants, who were told what to include and exclude in their reports, according to the NTD Consulting Group’s review. TVA was not “appropriately self-critical” while looking at the plant’s work culture, according to NTD. “Mistrust permeates the organization, yet in leadership’s mind the challenge is contained to operations and represents a miscommunication problem rather than a need for management to regain trust and credibility,” NTD’s report said. TVA President and CEO Bill Johnson said the report doesn’t represent the current state of affairs at Watts Bar or at TVA. The report includes interviews conducted by the inspector general in 2015. “The NRC told us last March we had a chilled work environment at Watts Bar and we have never contested that fact,” Johnson said. “We don’t contest it, and we’ve been working hard for the past year to fix it.” Johnson said he can’t answer whether TVA dictated what went into third-party reports. He didn’t witness the interviews because the inspector general’s office is independent. Additionally, the NTD group only reviewed the information secondhand, he said. TVA is a federal power supplier that serves 9 million people in parts of seven states in the Southeast. ___ Information from: Knoxville News Sentinel, http://www.knoxnews.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

SEATTLE (AP) - Thousands of people across the U.S. marched in rain, snow and sweltering heat Saturday to demand action on climate change - mass protests that coincided with President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office and took aim at his agenda for rolling back environmental protections. At the marquee event, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, D.C., tens of thousands of demonstrators made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue on their way to encircle the White House as temperatures soared into the 90s. Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. “We are here because there is no Planet B,” the Rev. Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston. The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines. Participants Saturday said they object to Trump’s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things. Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame. Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing Environmental Protection Agency employees. Trump has proposed cutting the EPA’s budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs. John O’Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, called the march “a chance to speak out in unity against this administration” and its “ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.” More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe. “I’ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,” said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine. People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood. Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources. “But I see untapped power here today,” she said. A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city. People gathered on the Boston Common carried signs with slogans such as “Dump Trump.” Handmade signs at Seattle’s march included the general - “Love Life” - and the specific - “Don’t Kill Otters.” Some of the marches drew big-name attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the nation’s capital. In Montpelier, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called the marches part of a fight for the future of the planet. “Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted. ___ Associated Press writers Sara Burnett in Chicago; Colleen Slevin in Denver; Wilson Ring in Montpelier, Vermont; and Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.

Memorial will honor 2 World War I aviators who died on Gettysburg Battlefield
.B
The last troops to die on the Gettysburg Battlefield in Pennsylvania did not fight in the infamous Civil War conflict, but in World War I. Capt. George Hamilton and Gunnery Sgt. George Martin — both Marine Corps aviators — died in a plane crash on the battlefield during training maneuvers in June 1922. As the 95th anniversary of the crash approaches, Gettysburg-area residents and the Gettysburg Battlefield Detachment of the Marine Corps League are working to establish a memorial to honor the fallen flyers. “When those Marines got killed here, it made national news,” said Richard Fulton, a Gettysburg writer/historian who helped spearhead the memorial effort. “This is just another piece of history that’s gone by the wayside.” Hamilton, a highly decorated survivor of the Battle of Belleau Wood near the Marne River in France during World War I, was flying a dive bomber over the Gettysburg battlefield with Martin during re-enactment maneuvers. The plane crashed while the pilots attempted to land at a farm in southern Pennsylvania. In the week before the crash, the flyers and 5,500 other Marines marched from Quantico, Virginia, to Gettysburg to perform Civil War re-enactments — a public demonstration that doubled as a training exercise. “They pulled out tanks and dive bombers and re-enacted Pickett’s Charge, World War I style,” Mr. Fulton said. “Really made quite a bit of noise, I’m sure. But that’s why the dive bombers were there.” The demonstrations also helped save the Marine Corps from being disbanded after World War I, said Mr. Fulton, who co-wrote the book “The Last to Fall: 1922 March, Battles & Deaths of U.S. Marines at Gettysburg.” “The Marine Corps was struggling to present its importance to the public in order to save itself,” he said. The famous battlefield was used again during World War II, when it served as a camp for 800 German prisoners of war. While at the camp, prisoners were required to work for local farmers. The cheap labor helped save the area’s agricultural economy, Mr. Fulton said. The memorial, which is slated for a dedication in June, is to honor the two flyers who have been “buried in the focus of the Civil War,” he said. “This whole town has been kept in this little warp of three days in 1863 because of the battlefield being here,” he said. “So a lot of the other historical events that have happened here have been forgotten.” The Gettysburg Battlefield Detachment of the Marine Corps League set up a GoFundMe web page to raise $7,500 for the memorial. The page had raised more than $2,750 as of Tuesday. Mr. Fulton said the memorial will include historical facts about the pilots and the crash. The Gettysburg Heritage Center, a gift shop and museum dedicated to Gettysburg history, donated a portion of its property near the crash site for the memorial. Center President Tammy Myers said the exhibit honoring Hamilton and Martin will help tell a lesser-known story of Gettysburg. “Even though most of our emphasis in the past has been on the Civil War, it’s nice to paint a broader picture of what’s happened here,” she said. Any extra money raised for the memorial will be donated to the Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania Foundation, Mr. Fulton said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Artists lobby Congress for fairer share of music royalties at ‘We Write the Songs’
.B
The ASCAP Foundation hosted songwriters, singers and composers at the Library of Congress Tuesday for the annual “We Write the Songs” event. Wednesday the artists then met with legislators for ASCAP’s “Stand with Songwriters” Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill, an event whose aim is to urge lawmakers to update federal music licensing regulations for the modern music marketplace. Peter Frampton, Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty and songwriters Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman of the band The Hooters were all on the Hill for the occasion. “I’m here to meet with members of Congress from across the political spectrum to discuss the challenges songwriters like me face in today’s music marketplace, and why the laws that regulate our music licensing system need to be updated to reflect the way people listen to music today,” Mr. Bazilian said in a statement provided to The Washington Times. His colleague Mr. Hyman said that as streaming becomes more and more common, “it seems like it’s being valued less and less.” “It’s time to update the outdated and overregulated music licensing system, and we need Congress’ help now to help protect the music we all love,” Mr. Hyman said. ASCAP President Paul Williams spoke at the event with a bipartisan coalition of sympathetic lawmakers, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat and Rep. Doug Collins, Georgia Republican. ASCAP members took to the dais to also frown upon President Trump’s proposed cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, The Washington Post reported. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Feds may reduce Metro’s grant funding if no safety plan in place
.B
The Federal Transit Administration has threatened to cut a quarter of Metro’s grant funding if the transit system fails to put in place a plan to better protect track workers and inspectors. The move was prompted by at least four incidents in which violations to Metro’s safety procedures “led to unauthorized workers on the roadway and trains entering protected work zones at track speed,” the federal agency said in a letter to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). “I find that unsafe conditions and practices exist that present a substantial risk of death or personal injury to roadway workers at WMATA,” FTA Associate Administrator Thomas Littleton said in the letter. The most high-profile incident occurred last year, when a train nearly struck two federal inspectors on the track near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Due to a miscommunication, the train operator came around a blind corner going faster than the 10 mph speed limit. A Metro track worker saw the train and yelled to the other to jump out of the way. No one was hurt in the incident. The FTA directed Metro to fix six deficiencies, including requiring the use of at least one redundant protection method to hold trains outside of a work zone, reducing rail controller distractions and workload and requiring 100 percent repeat-back radio protocol for all communications between rail controllers, operators and workers. Metro said in a statement that it already is working on strengthening worker protections in the system. Officials already have implemented procedures in the Rail Control Center requiring controllers to document the signals they are canceling to protect workers. The controllers also must record specific trains alerted to personnel on the right of way during track closures. “This procedure is being routinely audited by management to ensure compliance,” Metro said. “We will provide a full and timely response to all of the recommendations in the FTA’s letter.” Metro also said it’s taking other corrective actions including implementing the “Protran technology warning system” as a secondary measure for roadway protection, which is funded through an FTA grant. The technology, meant to be a backup to normal safety measures, uses armbands that flash as a train approaches giving workers extra time to get out of the way. Metro’s worker union applauded the FTA’s letter, saying the agency’s “observations about fast moving trains through work zones are only the tip of the iceberg of the fatal flaws and ineffective safety culture at WMATA.” “It is unacceptable and dangerous for WMATA’s flagging system to depend on hope and good luck to protect track workers,” said Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents thousands of Metro workers. “It is long overdue for WMATA to develop an adequate primary flagging system to provide positive protection to warn, slow and hold approaching trains until all employees are determined to be clear of oncoming trains.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Angling for readers? Anne Arundel County library now loaning out fishing rods to patrons
.B
A library south of Baltimore is angling to get a fresh catch of patrons this spring. The Anne Arundel County Public Library announced earlier this month that its Mountain Road branch was beginning to lend out fishing poles for two weeks at a time, partnering up with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources for the effort. “The mission of the Anne Arundel County Public Library is to educate, enrich and inspire our customers,” county library CEO Hampton “Skip” Auld said in an April 6 news release. “Given this county’s extensive shoreline and interest in water activities, we feel like this program is a good fit.” According to the county library’s Twitter account, it loaned out its first fishing rod on April 19. At press time, a listing in the county library’s online catalog shows only one of the eight rods in inventory is currently checked out. Patrons who fail to return a fishing rod will be fined a replacement fee of $15, according to the county library website. While perhaps an unusual item to lend out, lending out fishing rods seems to fall in line with libraries expanding their repertoire beyond books, DVDs and CDs. The Prince George’s County’s Memorial Library System (PGCMLS), for example, offers patrons at three branch locations the opportunity to check out WiFi hotspots. PGCMLS also permits adult library-card holders to borrow an iPad at the Spauldings branch in District Heights for up to two hours, provided they don’t take the tablet from the premises. “At the end of two hours, an unreturned iPad becomes overdue. Your library account will be charged the replacement cost of $600.00 and the police will be notified,” warns PGCMLS on its website. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Smoke-in demonstration leads to arrest of four marijuana activists
.B
U.S. Capitol Police on Monday arrested four marijuana activists who had staged a smoke-in demonstration on the Capitol’s lawn to call for the nationwide legalization of cannabis. Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki said officers arrested two men and two women, who were charged with possession and taken to police headquarters for processing. Monday’s incident followed Thursday’s arrests of eight pot advocates who were handing out free joints in front of the Capitol on D.C. property. Though possessing small amounts of pot is legal in the city, that area is patrolled by Capitol Police, who charged those activists with possession and possession with intent to distribute. Both protests were organized by DCMJ, a local advocacy group that calls for legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana. Monday’s demonstration took place on the lawn on the southeast side of the Capitol. Between 20 and 30 activists gathered there with signs and flags, wearing apparel decorated with images of cannabis leaves. The demonstrators spoke for an hour about the positive effects marijuana has had on their lives. In a kind of ceremony, they said Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Rastafarian prayers over the marijuana before lighting the joints. As the activists lit up, Capitol Police calmly moved in to detain the smokers. DCMJ lobbyist Jessica Laycock said the religious component was performed, in part, to highlight freedom of speech and freedom of religion. DCMJ co-founder Adam Eidinger reiterated his group’s goal of the District exercising home rule when it comes to marijuana. “Congress is immorally telling us that D.C. doesn’t have home rule anymore when it comes to marijuana,” Mr. Eidinger told The Washington Times before the event. “Andy Harris’s amendment is blocking D.C. from writing its own laws.” In 2014, D.C. voters approved Initiative 71 that allowed the recreational use of marijuana. However, the Harris rider — proposed by Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland Republican — blocks the D.C. Council from taxing and regulating the sale of the drug. City residents may grow, possess and consume a small amount of cannabis only in their homes. DCMJ also is calling on Congress to reaffirm the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, which blocks the federal government from enforcing marijuana laws in states where the drug is legal for medicinal use. The amendment was first introduced in 2014 and has to be renewed with each subsequent budget. It’s unclear the importance President Trump puts on marijuana legislation, having expressed tacit support for medicinal use of the drug during his campaign. However, key members of his administration are outspoken against the drug. At a speech at George Washington University last week, Homeland Security Security John Kelly called marijuana a “potentially dangerous gateway drug that frequently leads to the use of harder drugs.” Speaking at an event in Richmond last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he rejects the idea that “America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store.” “And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana — so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful,” Mr. Sessions said. “Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life. In the ‘80s and ‘90s, we saw how campaigns stressing prevention brought down drug use and addiction. We can do this again.” Twenty-nine states and the District allow for the use of medical marijuana. Recreational marijuana is allowed in the District, Alaska, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Va. first lady Dorothy McAuliffe weighs House run in 2018
.B
Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock is in for a number of Democratic challengers in her 2018 re-election bid — a list that may include Virginia first lady Dorothy McAuliffe. Ms. McAuliffe made her intentions known this week through her husband, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who said in an interview with The Washington Post that his wife was “very seriously considering” a run against Ms. Comstock in Virginia’s tenth congressional district. Ms. McAuliffe would be the fifth Democrat to join the race to unseat Ms. Comstock, a Republican currently serving her second term in Congress. The district is historically red, but Hillary Clinton won the district over Donald Trump in November, giving Democrats some hope they can take the seat. This is expected to be one of next year’s most competitive House races.

Karl Racine, D.C. AG considering mayor run, yet to make his mark
.B
Halfway through his first term, Karl Racine has set out to make his mark as the District’s first elected attorney general, but critics charge that he has done little to define the office — or himself — since stepping into the spotlight. Now mulling a run for D.C. mayor, Mr. Racine has touted his two years of fighting for juvenile justice reform, affordable housing and consumer rights. “There is much we can do to make the District a more just and equitable place,” Mr. Racine said in an interview. “I want residents to have faith in their public officials, to know that we’re here to fight for them.” But that hasn’t impressed everyone. “I like Karl Racine. He’s a good guy. But he hasn’t done anything significant,” said Chuck Thies, a longtime political consultant who most recently has worked for D.C. Council member Vincent C. Gray, Ward 7 Democrat. The consensus among city government watchers is that Mr. Racine has aimed to do good by the city but his efforts haven’t necessarily increased his name recognition or amounted to political victories. Dorothy Brizill, a government watchdog who has been tangled with City Hall officials since the 1980s, said Mr. Racine has not defined a role for his office, which is important for an inaugural leader. “It’s not that I’m supercritical; I just haven’t drank the Kool-Aid when it comes to Karl Racine,” Ms. Brizill said. “I’ve followed him from the day he announced his candidacy. I don’t think he ever really developed a clear idea of what he would do if he got the position.” Mr. Racine, 54, made history in 2015 when he took office as the city’s first elected attorney general. Since 1905, the city had employed a corporation counsel or chief legal officer who was appointed by the mayor. City voters in 2010 approved amending the D.C. Charter to establish an elected attorney general and enumerate its powers beyond those of the mayor’s counsel. Unlike other attorneys general, the District's AG mostly tends to juvenile justice, civil litigation and consumer protection cases. The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia handles adult criminal cases. Mr. Thies and Ms. Brizill said Mr. Racine has focused too much on national issues such as class-action lawsuits with other states and fighting President Trump’s immigration travel ban. “He’s not really grown into the position as our first attorney general,” Mr. Thies said. “Instead, he’s being cautious and joining other attorneys general against Trump. Instead, he should go sue someone, become an advocate for the people.” Said Mr. Racine: “It’s important for an AG to stand by his colleagues across the country.” Meg Maguire, vice chairwoman of the Committee of 100 on the Federal City, said Mr. Racine has taken up the cause of residents in several big cases, including two against Sanford Capital — a landlord that has racked up 200 warnings for housing code violations at apartment complexes for low-income residents. “This is particularly important in terms of preserving affordable housing in the city,” Ms. Maguire said. “You have rogue bad-actor landlords like Sanford Capital taking voucher money from the city and creating intolerable living conditions for people who have no other choice.” Rob Marus, Mr. Racine’s spokesman, said the attorney general “has defined the office’s client as not only the D.C. government but also the broader public. Everything has flowed out of that dual commitment.” In his midterm report, Mr. Racine has claimed several victories: • More than 12,000 criminal and juvenile convictions. • 750 placements for children in the foster care system. • Millions of dollars in restitution paid to D.C. residents through consumer protection cases. He also has trumped juvenile justice reform and affordable housing as top priorities and has twice sued Sanford Capital for forcing renters to live in deplorable conditions in four Congress Heights apartment buildings. In an effort to increase affordable housing options, the attorney general said he persuaded the District’s Department of Housing and Community Development to start using its authority to acquire blighted properties for renewal. In the past two fiscal years, the District has initiated or closed 14 land acquisition cases. Mr. Racine has called for reforming the way courts deal with minors. That includes banning the practice of shackling juveniles in court proceedings, which he said “unnecessarily humiliates and stigmatizes youth and can undermine the rehabilitative purpose of juvenile court.” He also has increased the rate at which we the city provides intervention to low-level, nonviolent juvenile offenders. “You can’t be blindly soft or tough on crime,” Mr. Racine said. “You have to be smart on crime. Make distinctions as to the kids who benefit from a different kind of involvement than the criminal justice system.” The attorney general is one of two top figures whose names have been floated as challengers to Mayor Muriel Bowser in next year’s Democratic primary. Mr. Gray, a former mayor, is the other. “I am having conversations with folks around town to get a sense as to what it would take to run for another position. I’m nowhere near making a decision on that. Period,” Mr. Racine told WAMU’s “The Kojo Nnamdi Show” in March. Though Miss Bowser and Mr. Gray may have more name recognition than Mr. Racine, they also have more political baggage: • Mr. Gray served his entire mayoral term under the cloud of a federal investigation of $650,000 in illegal donations to his 2010 campaign. The five-year probe ended without any charges against Mr. Gray but with the convictions of a dozen of his associates. • Miss Bowser was put on the spot on ethics early in her tenure when FreshPAC, a political action committee set up by her supporters and disbanded in 2015, came under fire after revelations that many of its donors either did business with the city or had sought to. From Haiti to the District Mr. Racine’s interest in public service was shaped at an early age. He was born in Haiti in 1963, just six years after Franois “Papa Doc” Duvalier — the rural doctor turned dictator who proclaimed himself president for life — took over the island nation. The unrest and oppression of the Duvalier regime forced the family to leave Haiti. They moved to the District and settled near the intersection of Wisconsin and Connecticut avenues in the Friendship Heights neighborhood when Mr. Racine was a child. Visitors to the Racine household educated the future attorney general as much as his schooling. The city’s Haitian population was small, and the Racines opened their home to people from all the cultures that made up the District. “He was reared in a Haitian home and a multicultural society,” said Marie Racine, his mother and a professor of French and linguistics at the University of the District of Columbia. “We valued diversity. When you look at people, they are individuals that come with a background, the solid background of a culture. You realize what it means to come from one place and another place.” Mr. Racine said that was invaluable to his work as a lawyer and civic leader. “To understand another point of view, it makes for better human relationships,” he said. “We were always about diversity.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Planned Parenthood founded on racism, belief in protecting society against ‘the unfit’
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Editor’s note: This column is part of a series by Rebecca Hagelin on the moral imperative of defunding Planned Parenthood. Minorities crammed into impoverished areas in inner cities should not be having so many babies. And, of course, these minorities (including most of America’s immigrants) are inferior in the human race, as are the physically and mentally handicapped. We should require mandatory sterilizations of those less desirable and promote easy access to abortion. And since sex should be a free-for-all, we must provide birth control and abortions to teenagers too. It’s all for the greater good and for a more intelligent, liberated, healthier population. Feel a bit enraged by the sentiments above? They absolutely sicken me. If you are feeling squeamish or angry too, then you should call your representatives in Congress and demand an end to your tax dollars funding Planned Parenthood. You also can sign the petition at LiveAction.org. For such are the foundational beliefs of this inherently racist organization and its celebrated founder, Margaret Sanger, who still is lauded on the Planned Parenthood website. Of course, in the lavish online praise of Sanger, conveniently absent is her advocacy for “a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.” (The quote is from her article “A Plan for Peace.”) Or her promotion of the “American Baby Code,” in which she seeks to “protect society against the propagation and increase of the unfit.” Also missing is Sanger’s fear of her racist views being exposed, as recorded in a 1939 letter to an ally: “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” Which is exactly what she set out and succeeded in doing. Planned Parenthood is largely the reason why black babies are aborted in America three times more often than white babies, and Hispanic preborns are killed 1½ times more often than whites. In fact, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research compiled by TooManyAborted.com, “Abortion is the number one killer of black lives in the United States. More than HIV. More than heart disease. More than cancer. Abortion snuffs out more black lives than all other causes of death combined.” Planned Parenthood masquerades as a benevolent organization, claiming to offer a full array of women’s health care services to disadvantaged women. From the way Planned Parenthood markets itself, one would think it offers basics such as mammograms and prenatal health care — especially for poor women living in the nation’s most impoverished neighborhoods. But it does not. Mammograms are nowhere to be found. And, as LiveAction.org recently revealed in an extensive investigation in the 41 states where undercover recordings are legal, 92 out of 97 clinics contacted admitted that they do not provide prenatal care. The bottom line is that those ultrasound machines in Planned Parenthood are used to facilitate the killing of preborn babies, not care for them. What Planned Parenthood does offer en masse in its “clinics” — which are strategically located in target areas such as college campuses and in impoverished, inner-city neighborhoods — are birth control and abortions. In fact, a baby is aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic at an average rate of every 90 seconds. Why college campuses? Why poor, minority inner-city neighborhoods? Because Planned Parenthood holds a worldview that young women should be able to have sex without consequences or responsibility. Because Planned Parenthood wants these same young women to come back to their clinics for their abortions when the birth control fails. And because Planned Parenthood still seeks to provide abortions for minorities over whites. Today, Planned Parenthood may not be racist in its words, but it is still overtly racist in its deeds. Thanks to the brilliant work of LiveAction.org, TheCenterforMedicalProgress.org and other truth seekers, we now know that Planned Parenthood traffics in human baby body parts, that it covers up the sexual trafficking of minors, that it engages in racist practices, that it provides birth control to underage girls without parental consent and that it does not provide the most basic of women’s health care services. America is better than this. It’s time for Congress to cut off funding to this shameful organization and direct our tax dollars to other clinics that offer life-giving health care services.

March for (Political) Science: Earth Day rally doubles as latest anti-Trump protest
.B
Take the Women’s March on Washington, slash its attendance, throw in Bill Nye “the science guy,” and you have the formula for Saturday’s March for Science, the latest in this year’s series of anti-Trump protests. Framed as a defense of scientific inquiry, the Earth Day march offered a lesson in political science as speakers urged thousands of rain-soaked attendees to fight President Trump’s “anti-science” agenda by advocating more federal funding for research. “This is about last November’s election,” said Denis Hayes, coordinator of the first Earth Day in 1970. “Did America somehow vote to melt the polar ice caps and kill the coral reefs and acidify the oceans? Did we vote to reduce the EPA’s research budget by a whopping 42 percent? Did we vote to defund safe drinking water by one third?” SEE ALSO: Transgender man addresses March for Science “Well, that’s what we got,” said Mr. Hayes, followed by a chorus of boos. Thousands gathered in the shadow of the Washington Monument prior to the march to hear from a lineup of speakers that consisted of scientists, progressive activists and at least one poet, while others gathered at more than 600 satellite events across the nation and around the world. Organizers had insisted beforehand that the march, while political, was non-partisan, an assertion belied by the sea of anti-Trump signs and repeated condemnations of the Trump administration. SEE ALSO: March for Science attendance dwarfed by March for Life, Women’s March The Democratic National Committee War Room sent out a blast Saturday pegged to the event saying, “Donald Trump doesn’t believe in climate change.” “Today as Americans across the country march for science, say you’re ready to fight against the anti-science GOP,” said the email missive. Among those in the crowd Saturday was Stephen Meyer, director of the Discovery Institute’s Center for Science Culture, who said the March for Science and its supporters made claims that science alone can’t support. “They’re conflating political claims about the need to fund the EPA or to prevent the Keystone pipeline with science,” said Mr. Meyer. “They’re conflating religious and philosophical claims about materialism with science. And then they’re conflating particular theories with the practice of science itself, such that if you disagree with those theories, you’re deemed a ‘science denier.’” “So it’s massive confusion because of the conflation at all three of those levels,”he said. The crowd was considerably smaller than that of the Women’s March on Jan. 21 but otherwise strikingly similar, with some protesters even wearing pink hats. The overlap was not lost on some speakers. “So today we’re back on the mall with a march,” said Megan Smith, who served under President Barack Obama as the chief technology officer to the United States government. “I brought my pink hat, but I also brought my pink lab glasses.” There were cheers for Mr. Obama after Christy Goldfuss, a former Obama administration official now with the Center for American Progress, said he had protected “more of the ocean than any president in history.” A trip with the president to the Pacific Ocean reminded her of a popular Disney movie: “Being there, I felt just like Moana, this incredible pull to the ocean, and as Moana says, ‘See that line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me, but no one knows how far it goes.’” “Well, science tells us how far it goes,” said Ms. Goldfuss. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, challenged the march’s anti-GOP narrative with a list of the panel’s recent passage of bills supporting research on innovation, weather forecasting, and space exploration, as well as legislation promoting women and students in science. “I look forward to continuing to promote scientific integrity and a healthy, transparent and vibrant research and technology environment in the United States,” the Texas Republican said in a Saturday statement. Despite being hampered by a spring rain, the march drew a respectable crowd that numbered in the low tens of thousands. The selection of Mr. Nye, a white male, as an honorary March for Science co-chair ignited a flap last month over diversity, but march-goers greeted him enthusiastically with chants of “Bill!” “Some may consider science the purview of a special or separate type of citizen, one who pursues natural facts and generates numerical models for their own sakes, but our numbers here today show the world that science is for all,” Mr. Nye said. “Our lawmakers must know and accept that science serves every one of us, every citizen of every nation and society.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

The movement for science is apparently third on the pecking order behind those for life and women’s rights. The attendance at the March for Science’s flagship rally in Washington, D.C., is lagging well behind the hundreds of thousands who showed up for the March for Life and Women’s March earlier this year. Roughly one thousand have so far poured into the event space north of the Washington Monument for the science rally Saturday morning. Organizers said they expect tens of thousands to show up for the event, which officially kicks off at 10:00 a.m. ET. The march also boasts hundreds of sattelite rallies around the world.

Transgender man addresses March for Science
.B
Among the speakers at the March for Science on Saturday was a transgender man. Kellan Baker, a senior fellow with the LGBT research and communications project at American Progress, said it’s important for researchers to remember that the data they collect tell stories. “We all have a story. Mine is that I’m a public health geek and a policy wonk. I’m also a queer transgender man,” Mr. Baker said, drawing applause. The diversity statement of the March for Science says “people who care about science are an intersectional group, embodying a diverse range of races, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, religions, ages, socioeconomic and immigration statuses.” “We, the march organizers, represent and stand in solidarity with historically underrepresented scientists and science advocates,” the statement reads. One of the march’s partners is the National Center for Transgender Equality. Mr. Baker said “science is not neutral” on political questions. “Advocacy is not a dirty word,” he said. “Science is objective, but science is not neutral. The poet Dante wrote that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who remain neutral in moral crisis. We cannot pretend we are above the fray.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Bill Nye, the white guy: Political activists start to take over March for Science
.B
An early indication that next week’s March for Science may be more about politics than the periodic table is the brouhaha over Bill Nye, the Science Guy. Mr. Nye’s selection as honorary co-chairman raised hackles not because he is arguably not a scientist — he holds a bachelor of science degree in engineering — but because he is a white male, igniting a protracted, furious debate on race, gender and “privilege.” March for Science organizers ultimately named three co-chairs, Mr. Nye and two women — pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha and biologist Lydia Villa-Komaroff — while dropping any pretense that the April 22 protest targeting the Trump administration is politically neutral. That argument was proving to be a tough sell, anyway, given that the event’s partners include NextGen Climate, funded by top Democratic Party donor Tom Steyer, as well as a host of climate change groups and labor unions. “It was a mistake to ever imply that the March for Science is apolitical — while this march is explicitly nonpartisan, it is political,” said the march’s statement on diversity and inclusion. That clear tilt to the left has other scientists as well as science boosters worried that the march will drag legitimate scientific inquiry into the political mud in an effort to “use the mantle of science to gain authority for one point of view,” said Wesley J. Smith, senior fellow at the Discovery Institute. “This manta ‘science,’ I mean, who’s against the scientific method? I don’t know anybody who’s against the scientific method. I don’t know anybody who doesn’t believe in science or who isn’t pro-science,” said Mr. Smith. In this case, he said, “you’re really not marching for science; you’re marching for a political agenda.” The march, which coincides with Earth Day, will hold its flagship event in Washington as well as 400 coordinated events worldwide, drawing comparisons to the Jan. 21 Women’s March against President Trump, which drew millions worldwide. Caroline Weinberg, national co-chairwoman, warned Monday that “evidence-based policies are under attack.” “Policymakers threaten our present and future by ignoring scientific evidence when crafting policy, threatening scientific advancement through budget cuts and limiting the public’s knowledge by silencing scientists,” she said in a statement. While the march has drawn the endorsement of groups such as the American Geophysical Union and Entomological Society of America, it’s the more explicitly political groups that have some scientists worried. Among the march’s partners are the Center for Biological Diversity, whose agenda includes fighting genetically modified organisms, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes GMOs and nuclear power, prompting the Mad Virologist’s Alma G. Laney to say he would not participate. “It’s incredibly sad to see a group that purports to be standing up for all science to willingly partner with groups that are anti-science or hold anti-science positions,” said Mr. Laney, a plant biologist. “Although there are many other partners that actively promote all science and I do believe that it’s important for scientists to speak, I don’t want to add credibility to anti-science rhetoric because, let’s face it, they are going to use partnering with the march to amplify their own anti-science messages. I just can’t be a party to that,” he said. Also staying home is Patrick J. Michaels, a climate scientist and director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute. The march has focused on the Trump administration’s reported plans to cut the budgets of federal health and science agencies as well as research grants to universities, but Mr. Michaels said the scientific community has other serious problems, namely research that cannot be replicated. “In order to produce a desired result, there is now an epidemic of studies that cannot be replicated and poor experimental design,” said Mr. Michaels. “The current administration will come and go, but the problems plaguing science will remain unless scientists demand changes that will right the currently foundering ship of science.” The focus on diversity drew alarm from William Briggs, an adjunct statistics professor at Cornell University, who said, “It seems organizers believe scientific results are less important than who is producing them. Diversity trumps science.” “They insist on diversity. That means rigorous, mandatory and monitored balance between people from favored groups,” Mr. Briggs said in the Stream. “This is not a scientific concept. It is pure politics. And anti-scientific politics, at that.” Zuleyka Zevallos, a sociologist and adjunct research fellow with Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia, chronicled the march’s heated back-and-forth over diversity, which included four rewritten diversity statements as organizers reacted to criticism from both sides. In a Jan. 28 tweet, the March for Science posted a tweet saying “colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism, queer-, trans-, intersex-phobia, & econ justice are scientific issues,” but later removed it, Ms. Zevallos reported. Among those who criticized the post was Harvard professor Steven Pinker, who accused organizers of compromising its goals with “anti-science PC/identity politics/hard-left rhetoric.” “The constant flip-flops on its diversity stance suggest that, at best, the organizers are undecided or lack the skills on how to manage inclusion issues,” Ms. Zevallos said in a March 14 post on Latino Rebels. “At worst, it gives the unfortunate impression that they have a wavering commitment to diversity, one which bends to the shifts of public pressure.” At the heart of the debate is that organizers are conflating science, which is a method, with a host of public policy issues, said Mr. Smith. “The problem now is that many who claim to be about science are really about social policy and ideology,” he said, “which are not the same things at all.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Michelle Obama says she won’t run for office: ‘It’s hard on a family’
.B
Former first lady Michelle Obama told a Florida crowd Thursday that she won’t run for office because of the toll it takes on the family. “It’s all well and good until you start running, and then the knives come out,” Mrs. Obama said at the American Institute of Architects convention in Orlando in her first speech since leaving the White House, the Orlando Sentinel reported. “Politics is tough, and it’s hard on a family,” she said. “I wouldn’t ask my children to do this again because, when you run for higher office, it’s not just you, it’s your whole family.” The former first lady, a Harvard Law School graduate, said she can be much more useful outside of office and not weighed down by “political baggage.” “One issue that I am excited about continuing to work on is … to help young girls get an education around the world,” Mrs. Obama said, citing the Let Girls Learn initiative she launched in 2015, the Sentinel reported. “Barack and I have been in public service our whole lives,” she said. “Public service will always be in our blood.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Berkeley’s first Latino mayor questions if city would see ‘such hate’ if he was white
.B
Jesse Arreguin, the first Latino mayor of Berkeley, California, on Thursday questioned whether the city would still be the target of such animosity from conservatives if he was white. Mr. Arreguin spoke to the Los Angeles Times from his fifth-floor office as pro-President Trump demonstrators gathered outside to protest Ann Coulter’s canceled speech at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Arreguin, who has reportedly participated in Black Lives Matter and Occupy Movement protests, said the city has become a “surrogate” for the resistance against the Trump administration, which makes it the target of “engineered” animosity from the right. “It’s engineered intense animosity against Berkeley, and that’s a narrative they keep putting out there,” the mayor told the Times. “It’s not lost on me that I’m Berkeley’s first Latino mayor. I have been outspoken against the Trump administration,” he said. “I have to wonder if the mayor was white, would we see such hate.” Mr. Arreguin, who co-sponsored a resolution last month calling for Mr. Trump’s impeachment, said he’s been on the receiving end of hate mail and death threats. His biggest fear, however, is that someone will get killed in one of the clashes, he told the Times. Free speech supporters descended upon the city Thursday to protest the canceling of Ms. Coulter’s speech at the UC Berkeley campus. Canadian contrarians Gavin McInnes and Lauren Southern headlined a free speech rally at MLK Civic Center Park and read an excerpt from the conservative firebrand’s planned remarks. Ms. Coulter was forced to cancel her appearance after university officials cited “very specific intelligence” of threats of violence against her. It came nearly three months after Mr. Yiannopoulos’s event at the campus was cut short due to an outbreak of violent protests. The Berkeley Police Department arrested five people and confiscated numerous weapons during Thursday’s demonstrations, the Times reported. “There were no reports of injuries nor any property damage,” police said in a statement.

Republican House candidate Karen Handel said her job isn’t to be “an extension of the White House,” despite President Trump’s expected visit to her district in Georgia on Friday. “My job isn’t to be an extension of the White House, my job is to be the best advocate I can be for the people of the 6th,” Ms. Handel said on Fox News. Ms. Handel is competing against Democrat Jon Ossoff for former House Rep. Tom Price’s seat in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Mr. Price now serves as Health and Human Services secretary. She did say, however, that she is just as supportive of the president as she was when he was elected, and expects to agree with him on many issues. “Nothing has changed,” Ms. Handel said. “President Trump is our president, and I support him 100 percent.” Since neither Ms. Handel nor Mr. Ossoff captured 50 percent of the vote in the April election, the race is going to a runoff scheduled for June 20.

Sessions: Some judges are more interested in advancing an agenda rather than the law
.B
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that some judges have become too political in their rulings, especially in the 9th Circuit Court. “I think we have a number of judges in the country that have departed a bit too far from classical enforcing the law as written, and using the law to advance an agenda that they may have personally,” he said on CBS News. “The 9th Circuit has been criticized for that tendency more than any other circuit.” The 9th Circuit Court has been a source of controversy when a federal judge in California blocked the Justice Department from withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities, cities that refuse to work with the department in identifying and capturing illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump has since said he’s considering breaking up the 9th Circuit Court, which includes most of the Western United States. The attorney general also touched on the recent revelations that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have broken the law in receiving payments from Russian groups without authorization. Mr. Sessions said he did not know enough about Mr. Flynn’s case to comment in detail, and said he doesn’t plan to be part of any possible investigation since recusing himself from all matters related to the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. But Mr. Sessions did say that the administration takes vetting very seriously and that though he doesn’t know the details of Mr. Flynn’s vetting, he believes mistakes do happen. “That’s a complex issue, and I’m not sure anyone can be expected to find that,” said Mr. Sessions in regards to Mr. Flynn’s case. “I don’t know the facts of this case, and maybe there’s an explanation for it.” Mr. Session did say the case highlighted an issue the administration and his agency are facing when it comes to leaks. “We are having a tremendous problem with leaks,” he said on NBC News, “I’m worried about it. I think we might need to do more to end this. “We’re going to follow our responsibility to analyze these matters. The CIA director shared with us leaks and things he thinks are important, and we will evaluate them properly.” Mr. Sessions is in Long Island, New York, on Friday to address the issues there relating to MS-13, a street gang comprised mostly of Central American criminals who have been tied to drug and human trafficking. The gang has recently caused a spike in crime on Long Island, where 15 homicides in Suffolk County have been traced back to the group. The attorney general is expected to face protesters who say the issue is not justification for the president’s new immigration policies. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump’s loyal voters aren’t buying ‘shameful’ media spin: Report
.B
As President Trump reaches his 100-day mark in office, an unfriendly news media has done much to undermine his efforts. Trump voters appear to be ignoring it all, says Ford O'Connell, a political strategist and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management. “Employing a blitzkrieg-style deluge of misleading headlines, both online and in print, coupled with a heavy diet of 89 percent negative broadcast network news coverage of Trump, the groupthink of the liberal media bubble has tried mightily to portray President Trump’s first 100 days in office as the worst political disaster of the last half century,” Mr. O'Connell tells The Washington Times. “How else are we to explain the fact that President Trump has the lowest approval rating since 1945, yet his supporters express little-to-no buyer’s remorse and that if the 2016 presidential election were held today, Trump would win the popular vote over Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll?” he continued. “Some things you just can’t make up, but that hasn’t stopped the mainstream media from trying to push their hostile views about Trump on to the American voter. Luckily for Trump, his supporters are not buying the shameful spin,” Mr. O'Connell said. Despite the constant pushback from journalists and news organizations, the president still has clear and positive options, however. “Whether it is pressuring companies to keep jobs in America, putting forth tax reform or renegotiating trade agreements, Donald Trump knows that he was first and foremost elected to put Americans back to work and boost wages. His maneuvers have instilled in the markets and consumers a palpable economic optimism,” Mr. O'Connell said. “Further, Trump’s actions regarding chemical weapons use in Syria and getting tougher with ISIS in Afghanistan have led voters to also see him as a strong leader, which is a significant break from his predecessor. If Trump can continue to improve the economy while simultaneously being seen as a decisive leader at home and abroad, he will win re-election in 2020,” Mr. O’Connell added.

Ann Coulter a no-show at raucous but peaceful Berkeley rally
.B
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Ann Coulter did not turn up in Berkeley where hundreds held a raucous but largely peaceful demonstration in her absence and lamented what they called the latest blow to free speech in the home of America’s free speech movement. The conservative pundit’s canceled appearance at the University of California, Berkeley drew hundreds of her supporters to a downtown park Thursday, many of them dressed in flak jackets, ballistic helmets adorned with pro-Donald Trump stickers and other protective gear in anticipation of violence. But there were no major confrontations between Coulter’s supporters and opponents, largely because of a significant police presence and the fact that members of an extremist left-wing group did not show up to provoke clashes. PHOTOS: Ann Coulter a no-show at raucous but peaceful Berkeley rally Coulter had publicly floated the idea of making a controversial visit to Berkeley despite the cancellation, but did not show. Her supporters and students on the UC Berkeley campus, many of whom expressed distaste for Coulter’s political views, voiced frustration that she didn’t get to speak and that the university’s reputation as a bastion of tolerance was suffering. Coulter planned to give a speech on illegal immigration. “I don’t like Ann Coulter’s views, but I don’t think in this case the right move was to shut her down,” said 24-year-old grad student Yevgeniy Melguy, who held a sign earlier in the day saying “Immigrants Are Welcome Here.” Anthropology major Christina Katkic, 21, worried that the university was getting increasingly stuck in the middle of the country’s political divide. “Berkeley has become a platform and a lot of people want to come here and use it,” said Katkic, who had joined other students on campus blowing bubbles near a message scrawled on the ground in chalk that read: “If only bubbles actually made our campus safe.” “I think Ann Coulter has a right to speak here. Berkeley students are interested in political discourse,” she said. University police erected barricades and refused to let any protesters enter the campus. Six people were arrested, including one for obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police, and another for possessing a knife. Hundreds of Coulter’s supporters gathered about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the university’s main Sproul Plaza at the Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park in downtown Berkeley. “It’s a shame that someone can’t speak in the home of the free speech movement,” said Wilson Grafstrom, an 18-year-old high school student from Menlo Park, California. He wore a helmet with a “Make America Great Again” sticker across the back, goggles, a gas mask and knee pads. He blamed people opposed to Coulter and President Donald Trump for forcing him to gear up for problems. Gavin McInnes, co-founder of Vice Media and founder of the pro-Trump “Proud Boys,” was one of several speakers at the gathering. He delivered the speech Coulter had planned to give on illegal immigration, on her behalf, to the crowd’s raucous applause. “They tried to ban her and we can’t allow that. It’s unacceptable,” McInnes said as he left the gathering surrounded by private security. “Free speech is about uncomfortable speech. Yes, it’s often about hate speech and it’s about speech that’s banned.” On its Facebook page, McInnes’ group calls itself a fraternal organization aimed at “reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism during an age of globalism and multiculturalism.” While the afternoon rally ended without serious conflict, police at one point formed a human wall in the street separating anti-Trump protesters from the park where pro-Trump groups were gathered. Anti-Coulter and anti-Trump protesters at the park held a banner that read: “It’s not about ‘free speech,’ it’s about bigots trying to normalize hate.” Earlier this month, a bloody brawl broke out in downtown Berkeley at a pro-Trump protest that featured speeches by members of the white nationalist right. They clashed with a group of Trump critics who called themselves anti-fascists. In February, violent protesters forced the cancellation of a speech by right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, who like Coulter was invited by campus Republicans. Officials at UC Berkeley said they feared renewed violence on campus if Coulter followed through with plans to speak, citing “very specific intelligence” of threats that could endanger Coulter and students, which Coulter said was motivated by a university bias against conservative speakers. Police had faced criticism after the earlier clashes for failing to stop the violence. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof credited the peacefulness of Thursday’s rallies partly to an increased police presence. He declined to specify how many police were deployed but said there were a “wide range” of local and regional agencies present. “I think it’s clear that having a strong visible police presence was important both in terms of deterrence and law enforcement,” he said, noting that even in Coulter’s absence hundreds descended on Berkeley. “This points to the challenges we face in the climate we’re living in.” ___ Associated Press writers Janie Har and Kristin J.

McCarthy: House will not vote on repealing Obamacare this week
.B
There will be no House vote on repealing Obamacare this week, the chamber’s majority leader confirmed Thursday evening. “We are not voting on health care tomorrow or Saturday,” Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said after a leadership meeting in the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. It already was clear that Republicans would have a hard time mustering the 216 votes needed, as 21 Republicans have publicly come out against a deal that the House Freedom Caucus had signed off on. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill had hoped to pass a Obamacare-repeal bill by the symbolic date of Mr. Trump’s 100th day in office, which would be Saturday. But centrist Republicans such as the Tuesday Group remained skeptical of the new plan, to let states opt out of parts of Obamacare requiring insurers to cover “essential” benefits such as maternity and mental health care or prescription drugs. States can also waive rules requiring insurers to charge healthy consumers the same amount as sicker consumers, so long as states set up risk pools to subsidize those priced out of the market, since insurers still cannot deny people with preexisting medical conditions. Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, downplayed the significance of the vote delay, as Mr. Ryan had downplayed the 100-day “deadline” issue earlier Thursday. “We’re gonna go when we have the votes,” the Wisconsin Republican said. • Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Congressional Israel Victory Caucus’ launch by Republicans reinforces support for Israel
.B
Republicans fortified their growing bond with Israel by launching Thursday the Congressional Israel Victory Caucus, a coalition aimed at promoting widespread recognition of the Jewish state’s right to exist as a predicate to peace. “We founded this caucus primarily on one single irrefutable principle, and that is first and foremost, Israel has a fundamental right to exist and defend herself. And that is not negotiable,” said Rep. Bill Johnson, Ohio Republican, who chairs the caucus with Rep. Ron DeSantis, Florida Republican. No Democratic lawmaker spoke at the press conference to unveil the caucus, which comes with President Trump championing Israel after eight years of strained relations under the Obama administration. Mr. DeSantis is the chairman of the House subcommittee on national security, which oversees U.S. embassies. He cited reports that Mr. Trump is in discussions to visit Israel on May 22, and predicted that the president at that time would announce the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Palestinians have claimed Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.) Mr. DeSantis, who toured in March possible relocation sites for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, noted that such a trip would coincide with the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem Day, which marks the reunification of the city after the Six-Day War in 1967. “I think it will send a powerful signal not only about the U.S.-Israel relationship — that we’re back and stronger than ever — but I think that will send a signal to other countries in the rest of the world that America is back, we’re going to stand by our allies, and that we’re not going to let folks cow us into not doing the right thing,” Mr. DeSantis said. Not one day old, the Congressional Israel Victory Caucus already has come under fire from liberal Jewish groups like J Street and Jewish Voice for Peace, which had urged members of Congress to boycott the launch, as well as pro-Muslim groups like MPower Change. J Street’s Alan Elsner dubbed it the “defeat Palestinians caucus,” arguing that the group is “devoted to pushing the truly terrifying myth that Israel can end the conflict by using brute force and repression to make Palestinians accept their eternal statelessness.” He cited the involvement of Daniel Pipes, president of the pro-Israel Middle East Forum, whom the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center has denounced as an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Mr. Pipes argued for persuading the Palestinian Authority to accept defeat in order to bring an end to the decades-old peace process, which he called the “war process,” saying it has made relations “worse, not better.” “The caucus I see as a beginning, a first step toward educating other members, talking to the administration, talking to allies, that there is an alternative to this desolate, fruitless counterproductive peace process, or war process,” said Mr. Pipes. “There is something else, something that will lead Israel, the Palestinians and the rest of us toward conflict resolution.” In his post, Mr. Elsner urged members of Congress to “stay as far away from such savage and dangerous ideas as possible. The creation of a caucus devoted to promoting them should be condemned, not celebrated.” Two protesters from Code Pink were escorted from the press conference after one unveiled a “Free Palestine” banner and began shouting messages like, “Israel is an apartheid state founded on racism!” Those in attendance and in support of the caucus included representatives of the Zionist Organization of American, Emet, Christians United for Israel and Americans for a Safe Israel, according to the Jerusalem Post. Rep. Keith Rothfus, Pennsylvania Republican, warned that Iranian leaders view Israel as a “one-bomb country,” which he called “something to reflect upon this week in the week of Holocaust remembrance.” “The caucus’ bedrock principle is understanding that Israel has a right to exist and Israel is going nowhere,” Mr. Rothfus said. “It’s unfortunate Israel’s enemies think that Israel will go away someday, but we have to disabuse them of that notion.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump supporters headline free speech rally at University of California, Berkeley 
.B
Trump supporters descended upon the University of California, Berkeley on Thursday to reaffirm the principles of free speech and robust debate after the school canceled a scheduled lecture by conservative author Ann Coulter. Canadian contrarians Gavin McInnes and Lauren Southern headlined a free speech rally at MLK Park and read an excerpt from Ms. Coulter’s planned speech in her stead. “They may be able to stop us from speaking on the campus, they may be able to throw punches, to spray pepper spray, throw bricks at us, but they can’t stop an idea,” Ms. Southern said. “They can’t stop the history of this nation and the determination to defend free speech and protect God-given rights.” Berkeley officials canceled Ms. Coulter’s speech last week citing security concerns and the possibility of violence, but quickly reversed course after a backlash ensued. Despite the university’s assurance that she was welcome, Ms. Coulter said she had to cancel the speech Wednesday after losing the backing of the student group that invited her, Young Americans for Freedom. The free speech rally was mostly peaceful, with protesters and hecklers only sparsely populated in the surrounding area. Among the hundreds of attendees were representatives from Oath Keepers and Bikers for Trump, who said they were there to ensure the event remained peaceful. Many of the participants were clad in black and wore motorcycle helmets. The excerpt from Ms. Coulter’s speech argued against accepting Muslim immigrants and those in need of government assistance. “When Trump merely proposed we stop importing people whose religion teaches them to kill us, the media called him a racist,” Mr. McInnes read. “Republicans said that’s not who we are. They know us so well. There are 7 billion people in the world; we don’t have to take any of them. There’s no constitutional right for the rest of the world to move here. “Immigrants are showing up with a lot of needs and a lot of grievances,” he continued. “Why do we owe them? If you have grievances, go home and address the perpetrators. We owe you nothing. By my reckoning, they owe us.” Mr. McInnes echoed those sentiments in his own remarks, asking why “American citizens, American immigrants and American millennials” aren’t more grateful to live in America. “As an immigrant myself, I gotta say, I’m kind of shocked to get here and see the number of ingrates both within my fellow immigrant community and within the American citizen community,” he said. He also noted that speakers who hold controversial liberal opinions have been allowed to speak on college campuses without the threat of violence. “You have Linda Sarsour giving a speech at CUNY,” he said, referring to the co-chair of the Day Without a Woman Protest. “No problem with that. This is a woman who supports Shariah law. This is a law where women have half the vote of men, a husband can rape his wife, a man can beat his wife.” The cancellation of Ms. Coulter’s speech comes less than three months after rioters set fire to the campus in response to a scheduled lecture from conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart editor. Young Americans for Freedom and the Berkeley College Republicans filed a lawsuit against the university, arguing the school failed to accommodate the club with a safe venue for the speech, giving them no choice but to cancel it. “In effect, our free speech has been stifled because the university has decided not to assist us in making sure the event can occur successfully,” Troy Worden, president of the Berkeley College Republicans, said in a press conference Wednesday. “We aren’t going to have a dangerous event.” For his part, Mr. Yiannopoulos has vowed to return to Berkeley in the fall for a whole week. “My proposed Free Speech Week will proceed as planned later this year,” he said Wednesday on Facebook, breaking out into all capital letters to declare: “I will bring an army if I have to.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Confirmed: Democratic Party sending protestors to Trump’s ‘100 Day’ speech in Pennsylvania
.B
There are two momentous political events to consider this weekend, and they are polar opposites. First, we have President Trump, who will step out on the broad stage of a major arena in Pennsylvania Saturday night for one of his favorite activities: a massive, grass-roots rally to affirm his first 100 days in office and to connect with the voters that love him. The event is not without issue. An anti-Trump protest and rally is planned by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and activists from around the state who claim the president’s time in office has been “filled with alternative facts, incompetence and international scandal.” Then there is the White House Correspondents Dinner in the nation’s capital, staged in a posh hotel some 96 miles to the south. Just as Mr. Trump arrives on stage in Harrisburg, several thousand formally clad journalists, lobbyists and celebrities will stroll out of a dozen different cocktail parties and begin the promenade toward the glittering ballroom, where they will dine on a sumptuous meal and giggle over inside jokes. Many will celebrate the fact that Mr. Trump is not among them. He opted out of the event weeks ago, winning accolades from a number of conservative pundits who applauded his decision to skip a long evening with the mostly hostile press. “Couldn’t agree more. This is a stupid event, and Trump is a serious president. There is no reason why he should indulge his enemies,” noted John Hinderaker, an analyst for Powerline. For the sake of civility, public calm and a bunch of other things, let us hope that both groups have a positive, pleasant, productive experience. Indeed, the White House crowd will enjoy a red carpet walk and 21 assorted pre-parties and after-events sponsored primarily by news organizations and activist groups. The elite population will include such famous folks as actors Billy Bob Thornton and Alyssa Milano, feminist Gloria Steinem and musician Elvis Costello. There has been persistent but unverified chatter that Hillary Clinton, actor and Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin and possibly former President Barack Obama could show up. Mr. Trump has protesters waiting, however. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party has organized “The Rally Against 100 Days of Broken Promises,” which includes Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman Michael Blake, multiple state lawmakers and officials, unions and Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse. “Bring your signs, hats and your slogans,” organizers advise. BODACIOUS: THE NRA IN ATLANTA Some 80,000 people are now happily making their way through the National Rifle Association’s bodacious annual meeting and exposition underway in Atlanta, an event that boasts a significant appearance by President Trump. Other rarefied celebrities also will be present at one time or another, including the NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, and Executive Director Chris W. Cox, Republicans Sens. Ted Cruz and David Perdue, Rep. Clay Higgins, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and former Rep. Allen West. See every speech streamed live online from 12:30 p.m. Friday through Sunday at NRATV.com. In the meantime, Mr. LaPierre does not have anything good to say about the “failing” news media, saying that the press has “never been less trusted, less credible and less respected” and fraught with “malpractice,” among other things. “For decades you ignored calls from millions of gun owners to just tell the truth. All you had to do was to just get the facts right about our guns and our freedom,” Mr. LaPierre says in a fierce public message to the media. “But you never even pretended to listen. Instead you weaponized the First Amendment against the Second Amendment. Now the whole country sees you as a mockery. Your claim to the truth is as legitimate as a thief’s. If the fact of individual freedom had rested in your hands, America would have fallen long ago.” VOTERS OF FAITH STILL LOVE TRUMP Millions of voters of faith voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in November, and they remain his most loyal supporters, according to the Faith & Freedom Coalition, which hosted the president as a candidate and publicly prayed for him during his campaign. “Faith-based voters who ushered President Trump into office last November — who were confident in his commitment to the sanctity of human life, and to his pledge to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with a justice who would respect the Constitution — are extremely pleased with his record of accomplishment this early into his presidency,” says Ralph Reed, chairman of the grass-roots organization, which boasts more than 1 million members. He cites surveys released this week by ABC/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal that reveal, among other things, that Mr. Trump’s strongest base of support remains evangelicals: 70 percent continue to support him, as do 52 percent of conservative Catholic voters.

 Americans agree: ‘first 100 days’ test for Trump is bogus
.B
President Trump says the “first 100 days” litmus test for White House achievement is ridiculous. The rest of the nation is not very keen on the idea either, which is reassuring. A new CBS News poll finds that 62 percent of all Americans say that 100 days is simply “not enough time” for them to judge the work of Mr. Trump and his administration. Of course, there’s a partisan divide: 82 percent of Republicans agree, along with 69 percent of independents and 37 percent of Democrats. “A president’s ratings at the 100-day mark don’t predict much about what his or her ratings will do over their term. Historically, recent Presidents’ approval ratings have moved up and down after those 100 days, depending on events and their performance as the years went on,” the poll analysis noted. The parties themselves differ on their 100-days thinking, meanwhile. The Republican National Committee is blasting the phenomenon, already ramped up by a gleeful news media as a prime Trump-bashing vehicle, fraught with extraordinary significance and meaning. Not so. The GOP has released a video titled “100 Days of Obstruction,” which highlights the Democrats’ “petty obstruction tactics” and stubborn refusal to find even an iota of compromise.” “It’s clear the Democrats have only one goal in mind: obstruction. They have refused to work with Republicans to find solutions to the problems that face our nation, and voters will remember this display of blind partisanship when they head to the polls this year and in 2018,” predicts Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. The Democrats, meanwhile, are fundraising. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has launched the “100 Day Resistance Fund,” playing off collective ire against the president. “Donald Trump will mark a hundred days in office on Saturday with nothing to show for it but broken promises,” Mr. Perez says in his outreach. “But to stop Trump for good, we need to start replacing his Republican allies in Congress, statehouses, and city councils. We’ve got to take our grassroots energy and use it to elect Democrats — voting out Trump apologists and putting people in office who share our values and will stand up to Trump.” THE NRA CONVENTION: ON TARGET Thursday is opening day for the National Rifle Association’s annual grand meeting in Atlanta, which includes a cavalcade of notable guests in the next 72 hours, including President Trump, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Hank Williams Jr. The event is astonishing in scope: More than 80,000 people are expected to attend, along with 800 exhibitors ranging from major manufacturers and suppliers to The Heritage Foundation and the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association. Thursday’s opening events will be capped off with the National NRA Foundation Banquet, a charitable event that includes a fine dinner plus a multitude of activities, all in support of shooting sports. “Help us teach freedom by bidding on custom firearms, unique merchandise and specialized hunts,” the organizers advise. It’s never too early to follow the big doings, found at NRAAM.org. LINDSEY CUTS TO THE CHASE “I really am impressed with his commander in chief skills here. He is not gonna let this nut job in North Korea develop a missile with a nuclear weapon on top to hit America.” — Sen. Lindsey Graham, weighing in on President Trump’s ongoing strategy for dealing with North Korea, to Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” A PRIEST WELCOMES PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATS Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez created some ripples in his party’s solidarity when he insisted that being a pro-choice Democrat “is nonnegotiable” — a rigid proclamation that caused even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to take notice, and not in a good way. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, sees an opportunity, however. He is now “inviting pro-life Democrats who are no longer welcome in their party to cross the aisle,” noting that a recent Pew Research Center poll found that 28 percent of Democrats say they would like to see abortion illegal in all or most cases. “Perez and all Democratic public officials who support child-killing are hypocrites on many levels, because they are unwilling to describe the very procedure they support. I want to hear Mr. Perez quote the medical textbooks on abortion as they describe the tearing off of the arms and legs of a baby and the crushing of her head. Then the debate can begin,” Father Pavone advises. “Meanwhile, what are those pro-life Democrats to do, trapped in a party that clearly doesn’t want them? Some work to change the party. But if the party doesn’t listen, switch parties,” the priest adds. HURRAH FOR HILTON A round of applause, please, for Hilton Hotels and Resorts — which plans to hire 20,000 military veterans, their spouses, dependents and caregivers in the next three years. The global hospitality giant — which operates 4,900 properties around the globe — already has made 10,000 military hires in the U.S. since 2013, exceeding its initial goal to reach that number two years ahead of schedule. “Military veterans and their families have made incredible sacrifices for our country, and we are strongly committed to ensuring they have great jobs when they return home from service. We’ve always felt strongly about this issue since our founder Conrad Hilton himself was a military veteran, and we are very proud of our veteran team members who have contributed so much to our company,” says president and CEO Christopher J. Nassetta. Hilton’s chief human resources officer, Matt Schuyler, praises vets for their leadership, integrity and teamwork, advising prospective employees that the company “will do everything it can to support you in making a smooth transition to the civilian workforce.” POLL DU JOUR • 66 percent of U.S. investors “expect strong returns” on their investments in the next six months. • 61 percent see more stability from the Trump administration. • 56 percent are poised to make more investments. • 48 percent see “more clarity” on what the U.S. government will focus on this year. • 40 percent expect lower personal income taxes, 40 percent expect more “infrastructure spending.” • 38 percent are worried they will “miss out on gains” if they don’t act on their investments.

Role call: News media casts conservatives as the extremists of Capitol Hill
.B
Ever wonder why Republicans always appear to be the villains on Capitol Hill? Easy. They have been cast in the role by the news media. As the GOP readies to overhaul Obamacare or confront a possible government shutdown, consider that broadcasters methodically portray the GOP — particularly such legislative entities as the House Freedom Caucus — in the role of villains or extremists. A representative new study of 141 news stories on the health care debate reveals that ABC, CBS, NBC did much to advance the public’s impression that Republicans are troublemakers. “In 30 days of health care debate coverage — March 7 through April 5 — the broadcast networks consistently framed it as a fight between unreasonable conservatives versus more moderate Republicans and Senate Democrats by overwhelmingly applying ideological labels to one side of the argument,” writes Geoffrey Dickens, an analyst for Newsbusters.org. “Overwhelmingly, the networks used conservative tags to talk about Republicans. Fully 80 percent of these labels talked about conservatives or those on the ‘right.’ Just 20 percent referred to ‘moderate’ Republicans,” he says in the study, noting that 11 percent of the labels painted conservatives as “far right,” “hard line” or “ultra-conservative” combatants. “Such deliberate labeling is designed to stigmatize conservatives, casting them as outside-of-the-mainstream ideologues, as compared to their usually unlabeled adversaries,” Mr. Dickens says, adding that Democrats “were never labeled” as liberal or progressive — though on two occasions, the Democratic lawmakers were referred to as “moderates.” REALITY CHECK: ABOUT THAT BORDER WALL “President Donald Trump’s request that Congress include $1.4 billion to fund the beginning of his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border equals approximately 0.035 percent of what the federal government will spend in total this year, according to the latest estimate of fiscal year 2017 federal spending made by the Congressional Budget Office,” writes the always meticulous Terence P. Jeffrey, who compared all the numbers. “It also equals less than the Department of Health and Human Services spends in just twelve hours and less than the Treasury collects in taxes in four hours,” Mr. Jeffrey adds. On another front, the Federation for American Immigration Reform already has crunched the numbers on the cost of the wall — an estimated $25 billion — versus the overall cost of caring for or managing America’s illegal immigrants. “Securing the southern border is a sound fiscal investment. The overall construction and annual maintenance costs pale when compared to the $113 billion FAIR estimates illegal immigration costs American taxpayers. In fact, if the project only results in a 5 percent reduction in the annual cost of illegal immigration to American taxpayers, and construction and maintenance costs reach the most expensive estimates, it would pay for itself after only six years,” the organization says in its study. LIFE GOES ON FOR JEB BUSH On the 2016 presidential campaign trail, Jeb Bush was simply known as “Jeb!” Now he will have a new title. “A group led by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former New York Yankees captain Derek Jeter has won the auction for the Miami Marlins baseball team with a $1.3 billion bid, according to a person with knowledge of the deal,” reports Bloomberg Sports. And it is a small world. The news organization reports that none other than Tagg Romney — eldest son of former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney — was one of the rival bidders for the team. CHEERING THE PRO-LIFE VICTORIES President Trump is being lauded for his pro-life accomplishments in a new report from the Susan B. Anthony List, which calls the president and Vice President Mike Pence “game changers” for the pro-life cause. “Not only have there been several pro-life victories within the first 100 days of their administration, we are confident that pro-life progress will continue. This is a new era,” says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the organization. She cites the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s order to stop taxpayer funding of the “abortion industry overseas,” plus specific key appointments of pro-life protectors in the Trump administration. They include Mr. Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Find the report here LIBERTARIANS PONDER THEIR HERITAGE The Libertarian Party is tracing its history back to its earliest days, which is somewhere around 1972. The results: “The LPedia” — a master library for loyal and curious Libertarians that will include historical documents, archives, news accounts, training materials and more. “This will be a huge project as we have an incomplete collection of these items in our archives and they are fragile. We’ll also have to overcome the challenges of scanning large newsprint pieces. The home for these records will be LPedia.org — the working collaborative, crowd-sourced history of the Libertarian Party,” advises Caryn Ann Harlos, who is overseeing the project. “This will not be limited to national items, though national items are those items in the scope of our Historical Preservation Committee. State parties can also use LPedia to preserve and update their history. It will take on a life of its own — spontaneous order if you will. Very libertarian,” she says. FOXIFIED It was a victorious debut for Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson on Monday night; he took over the 8 p.m. time slot following the abrupt departure of longtime host Bill O’Reilly last week. According to new audience numbers from Nielsen Media Research, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” drew 3.2 million viewers, besting CNN’s Anderson Cooper with 1 million viewers and MSNBC’s Chris Hayes with 1.5 million during the same time slot. Fox News’ average prime-time audience is up by 31 percent compared to this time last year. POLL DU JOUR •92 percent of U.S. business economists expect more hires and workplace stability in the next four months. •91 percent expect rising sales in the next quarter of 2017; 89 percent expect profits to rise or remain unchanged. •66 percent expect a rise in domestic product growth of up to 3 percent in the next four quarters. •31 percent expect profits to grow in the next quarter.

Inside the Beltway: Republican students sue Berkeley after campus blocks Ann Coulter speech
.B
“If Berkeley won’t protect its students rights, Young America’s Foundation will,” proclaims the conservative youth organization of the same name, which is mounting a lawsuit against the University of California, Berkeley after the school essentially blocked an upcoming appearance by commentator Ann Coulter. Officials launched a series of scheduling maneuvers to dissuade the popular author from appearing on campus. The young conservatives of the “YAF” are prepared to strike back. “Imposing a curfew on some high profile speakers but not others, forcing conservative speakers to speak in obscure locations at the edge of campus and only during the middle of the day, and suggesting Ms. Coulter speak at a place and time when there are no classes and students manifestly fails any objective test of fairness, rationality, or Constitutionality. Because you refuse to recognize these truths, our clients are left with no choice but to seek relief in court,” wrote the attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon in a letter to Christopher Patti, Berkeley’s chief counsel. Ms. Dhillon represents the Berkeley College Republicans and filed a lawsuit against the campus in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Monday. “When conservative students at Berkeley decided to host Ann Coulter through Young America’s Foundation’s campus lecture program, the school had plenty of notice. But instead of moving forward with event logistics for Coulter’s lecture, Berkeley’s administration chose to play a shell game with conservative students, only to ultimately cancel the event in the eleventh hour,” explains Spencer Brown, digital director for the organization. “It’s unfathomable that the university has arbitrarily applied restrictions and treated conservatives as second-class members of their community with a selectively-applied curfew,” Mr. Brown continues. “We’ve encouraged Berkeley to communicate with Young America’s Foundation or its attorney to work out a time for Ms. Coulter to speak on Thursday, yet Berkeley has unfortunately exhibited an unwillingness to work with conservatives, protect the First Amendment on campus, or simply have an open dialogue. In its insistence to continue violating students’ rights, Berkeley has forced our hand. Berkeley, we’ll see you in court.” The lawsuit “demands appropriate & safe venue for my speech THIS THURSDAY + damages,” Ms. Coulter tweeted Monday. VEXED WITH THE GOP “Approaching the vaunted one hundred day benchmark, it’s clear the Republicans, not the Democrats or their faithful media allies, are the biggest threat to Donald Trump’s presidency. Lost in various ego and ideology-driven agendas, the GOP legislators are doing their best to elect Elizabeth Warren president in 2020. Perhaps they should turn over their donor lists to the Massachusetts senator and make things easier and more direct,” writes Roger L. Simon, founder of PJ Media. “This may or may not speak poorly for Trump’s managerial skills. And it doesn’t account entirely for his poor poll numbers. But if there is a cancer on his presidency, it is coming largely from his own party’s inability to enact legislation when they have undisputed control of Congress and the executive branch,” he continues. “It’s almost as if the Republicans have a death wish and don’t really want to govern — subconsciously preferring to be an opposition party that doesn’t have to take responsibility for their actions, only for criticism.” MR. OBAMA EXPLAINS ALL Let us remember that a startling 89 percent of the broadcast coverage about President Trump has been negative in content and tone since he was inaugurated, according to a new Media Research Center evaluation. Yes, well. Former President Barack Obama offers his own assessment about the press. “Because of changes in the media, we now have a situation in which everybody is listening to people who already agree with them, reinforcing their own realities to the neglect of the common reality,” said Mr. Obama on Monday during his first public appearance since leaving office. READY FOR THE RED PLANET “Who’s ready to go to Mars up there?” — President Trump in a conversation on Monday with NASA astronauts Peggy Whitsun and Jack Fischer aboard the International Space Station. IVANKA DIPLOMACY First daughter, assistant to President Trump and gracious White House presence Ivanka Trump is off on a significant overseas trip. She arrives Tuesday in Berlin for the Women’s 20 Summit after receiving a direct invitation to attend from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ms. Trump will serve on a panel titled “Inspiring Women: Scaling up Women’s Entrepreneurship,” staged at the ultra-modern Intercontinental Hotel. Ms. Merkel herself will also be part of the panel, along with Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde and Bank of America vice chairman Anne Finucane. MEGYN AND VLADIMIR The eagle-eyed staff at the New York Post reveals that Megyn Kelly formally begins her reign at NBC News next month, set to debut in a new Sunday show in June. She was released from a long-standing contract with Fox News about two weeks ago. “NBC News chairman Andy Lack flew to Russia earlier this month to meet with Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, sparking buzz that a Putin interview may launch Kelly’s show,” writes Page Six correspondent Carlos Greer. Ms. Kelly will also headline a new morning show in autumn, appearing in what would have been the final hour of NBC’s storied “Today Show,” now trimmed down to two hours. POLL DU JOUR •75 percent of Americans want increased spending on veterans benefits; 70 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats agree. •67 percent overall want more spending on education; 52 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats agree. •50 percent overall want more spending on healthcare; 71 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of Democrats agree. •46 percent want more spending on military defense; 71 percent of Republicans and 31 percent of Democrats agree. •46 percent overall want more spending on environmental protections; 23 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of Democrats agree. •45 percent overall want more spending on the “needy of the U.S.”; 26 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of Democrats agree.

Inside the Beltway: Caitlyn Jenner to talk politics on Fox News with Tucker Carlson
.B
Some programming of note: On Monday, the very astute Fox News host Tucker Carlson essentially makes his formal debut in the coveted 8 p.m. time slot previously occupied by Bill O’Reilly for two decades. The network says Mr. Carlson’s first guest is none other than “Olympic Gold Medalist and author” Caitlyn Jenner, who has remained outspoken on a variety of subjects following a very public debut as a transgender woman two years ago. The left-leaning news media was mesmerized, but they have an ongoing political challenge here. The former Bruce Jenner is also a Republican. Fox News says that the guest “will include her perspective on President Donald Trump’s administration, the current political climate and divide in America, as well as her thoughts on how to bring Americans together.” That can be a tricky narrative and subject to interpretation, of course. In a recent ABC News interview, the 67-year-old celebrity advised Mr. Trump that if he doesn’t give the LGBT community “equality and a fair shot — I’m coming after you.” So we shall see. But wait. There is also a new book arriving Tuesday. The reality TV star has penned a memoir titled “The Secrets of My Life” — currently ranked No. 1 in the “rich and famous,” “transgender” and “sports and outdoors” categories at Amazon. A six-city book tour will follow. YES, THERE ARE POSITIVES President Trump’s critics squawk about many things, and purposefully cloud the public narrative with shrill melodrama and confusing half-truths. But such is the nature of the political marketplace — and it is indeed a marketplace with many salesman afoot. Which brings us to some clear poll findings about what Americans actually like about Mr. Trump. “Voters are all for President Trump’s order to federal agencies this week to ‘aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job,’ even though many suspect it will cost taxpayers more,” says a new Rasmussen Reports survey. It finds that 72 percent of a thousand likely U.S. voters favor the order to the federal government to buy American and hire American. Just 15 percent are opposed. And even in survey findings which reflect negative attitudes toward Mr. Trump, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that 73 percent of Americans approve the idea of White House pressure “on companies to keep jobs in the U.S.” The message from Trump voters to the president in this particular poll are clear: 96 percent of them would vote for him again, a clear indicator that the powerful, 63-million member demographic has “no regrets.” A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state,” said Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez in a new statement. But NBC’s “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd wanted to know if it was “absolutely possible” for one to be both a member of the Democratic Party and against abortion. So he asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi during her appearance on the show Sunday. “Of course,” she replied. MR. KASICH STRIKES A PRESIDENTIAL POSE Ohio Gov. John Kasich has all the hallmarks of someone gearing up for a presidential run, his second bid for the White House. He has a splashy and significant book arriving Tuesday titled “Two Paths: America Divided or United.” The author has already declared “Together, united, we can reclaim the America we love and hold so dear,” and promises to deliver a “powerful message of togetherness, a clarion call to reason and purpose and a clear path toward a more promising tomorrow.” That surely sounds like a catchy campaign phrase. On Monday, Mr. Kasich could expand on his idea during a CNN appearance. He appears on a live town hall complete with studio audience with prime-time host Anderson Cooper. The network says Mr. Kasich will weigh in on president Trump’s 100 days and his “hopes for the future.” His hopes for the future may not include espousing a rigid loyalty to one political party, however. “I think political parties are on their way out, essentially,” Mr. Kasich told CBS News in an interview Sunday. “I think people care less about party. They want action and things done.” A BILLIONAIRE NEW YORKER HAS A SAY Former New York City mayor Michael T. Bloomberg — just “Mike” as he prefers to be called — is worth $45 billion, and ranks as the eighth richest man on the planet according to Forbes. But he’s also not running for anything. Mr. Bloomberg came mighty close to a presidential run as an independent of sorts in 2016, prepared to drop $1 billion of his own money on the campaign, with retired admiral Mike Mullen as a running mate. But promising plans were as far as the team got. “If I thought we could win, or had a reasonable chance, I would have done it. It would be totally unlikely, very unlikely that an independent could win,” Mr. Bloomberg tells CBS News “60 Minutes,” noting that his “pro-choice, pro-immigration beliefs” would not have attracted any Republicans while Democrats would have frowned on his insistence that teachers be evaluated. “I’m 75 years old. It’d be an age issue, I suppose. I’ve got plenty of things to do. Maybe I’ll run for president of my block association, but not much more than that,” Mr. Bloomberg added. And one other thing. Mr. Bloomberg knows his fellow billionaires, including conservative libertarians Charles and David H. Koch, liberal George Soros and of course President Trump. Mr. Bloomberg says the first three gents genuinely want “to change the world.” The former Big Apple mayor called Mr. Trump to congratulate him on his White House win; he says the president promptly gave him his private cellphone number. But there does not appear to be much affection there. “I’m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one,” Mr. Bloomberg says of Mr. Trump adding, “I hope he does a good job.” POLL DU JOUR 41 percent of Americans say they are “concerned about the planet we are leaving behind for future generations.” 42 percent say they “personally care” about the future of the environment. 37 percent describe themselves as “environmentally conscious.” 25 percent say they are a conservationist, 23 percent say they are “green.” 21 percent describe themselves as an environmentalist.

Spectacle with agenda: March for Science advises demonstrators to ‘dress as your favorite scientist’
.B
Another weekend, another march on Washington: the nation’s capital played host to yet another jumbo demonstration with an agenda. Make way for the March for Science on Saturday, organized by the Earth Day Network and 170 other organizations that range from the National Science Teachers Association to the Union of Concerned Scientists. “There is no ‘official’ uniform or item of clothing for the March for  Science. We encourage you to be creative! Dress as your favorite  scientist. If you are a scientist, come in your work clothes — a lab  coat, goggles, a stethoscope, field gear — scientists work in all  settings and we shouldn’t limit the march to any specific kind. Or just  wear your comfortable ‘I’m ready to be politically active and send a  message about the need for science in policy’ outfit,” the organizers  advise. Find the march here The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, however, offered advice to  scientists and academics who plan to make their voices heard. Among  their salient points: “Separate your work and private life. Participate  and make statements on your own behalf, and not on behalf of your  employer. Be clear that you are involved in the March (or other  protests) as a private citizen. When marching, do not wear a university  sweatshirt, work-issued lab coat, etc.” Grievances are many. They want more funding and friendlier policy for scientists, and less questioning of their findings. They want gender and racial equality and plan to hold politicians accountable “if they silence, ignore, attack, or distort scientific evidence.” The scientific community itself is described as “peaceful, passionate, and diverse.” It’s a pretty big group. This weekend, there are also 517 satellite marches around the planet, and all of them appear to follow the same noisy template as the recent Women’s March, where spectacle and clever branding garners much news coverage. ‘LOONEY TUNES,’ CHEESY JOKES Meanwhile, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, recalls that David Gelernter, a Yale University computer science professor, was dubious about the upcoming march. “It’s like this is some sort of ‘Looney Tunes’ thing. I must be trapped in an alternate reality. They couldn’t possibly be serious,” Mr. Gelernter told The Scientist, an academic journal. “The organizers obviously are serious. Too serious, in our view. Using street protests to handle scientific controversies like climate change is only a few steps above using animal sacrifice,” says Mr. Kazman, who is collecting and publishing “cheesy Science March jokes” at his organization’s website, found at CEI.org. ADVICE TO BILL O’REILLY: TAKE YOUR SHOW ONLINE Speculation is percolating: What’s next for Bill O’Reilly, the former kingpin host at Fox News who departed the No. 1 cable network amid charges of sexual harassment in the workplace? Observers don’t expect the veteran newsman to retreat. And they do have some advice. “O’Reilly certainly seems armed for a battle. He has retained ‘master of disaster’ crisis consultant Mark Fabiani to navigate his new reality. What they do next depends on how many other shoes drop. One thing seems very clear, though: No one is mistaking the end of O’Reilly’s Fox News era with retirement,” writes Michael O’Connell, who covers television for the Hollywood Reporter, an industry publication. Some suggest that Mr. O’Reilly should go the route of independent media maven Glenn Beck, who was a Fox News host for two years before establishing his own online network and production company six years ago. Former CNN President Jonathan Klein, who founded TAPP, a subscription video platform, supports this strategy. So does Jon Cody, CEO of TV4, another online-based media enterprise. Eric Dezenhall, a crisis management consultant, does not expect a mea culpa from Mr. O’Reilly, noting that “outspoken, unapologetic clients often weather crises better than the quiet ones.” So we shall see. “Bill has got a mission. He loves the spotlight, and he’ll want to leverage the moment. His ardent fans are going to feel the abyss when he is gone, and that is a moment when Bill could strike,” suggests Mr. Klein. GOOD TO KNOW Well, just in case. A new Rasmussen Reports survey reports that 63 percent of likely U.S. voters think that Vice President Mike Pence “is qualified to assume the responsibilities of the presidency.” Less than a third — 32 percent — think Mr. Pence is not up to the role. TAPPING INTO TAPPER “President Obama was not friendly to the press, but the press was very friendly to President Obama,” Tapper says. “I mean, President Obama did not like me, and I understand why. I was a pain in his ass and I didn’t drink the Kool-Aid, and, you know, a lot of other people did.” — CNN anchor Jake Tapper, in an interview with GQ published Thursday WEEKEND REAL ESTATE Katharine Hepburn’s “Paradise” estate, a New England-style Colonial mansion built in 1939 on two acres overlooking Long Island Sound near Old Saybrook, Connecticut. The actress used the property as a summer retreat for many decades. Six bedrooms, eight baths, 8,400 square feet; completely restored in 2005. Living and dining rooms, chef’s kitchen, seven fireplaces, den, chart room, nautical theme throughout. Two-car garage with golf cart portico, private dock, pond and beach; multiple porches and terraces, elegant landscaping. Priced at $11.8 million through 10moheganavenue.com. POLL DU JOUR •88 percent of Americans say doctors should be allowed to prescribe small amounts of marijuana to patients with serious illness; 87 percent of Republicans, 87 percent of independents and 92 percent of Democrats agree. •71 percent oppose the federal government barring sale and use of marijuana in states where it is legal; 63 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents and 76 percent of Democrats agree. •65 percent believe marijuana is “less dangerous” than other drugs; 55 percent of Republicans, 66 percent of independents and 70 percent of Democrats agree. •61 percent say marijuana should be legal; 46 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of independents and 68 percent of Democrats agree. •50 percent have tried marijuana; 45 percent of Republicans, 55 percent of independents and 49 percent of Democrats agree.

President Trump plays ‘crazy card’ like a fox
.B
Hostile news organizations and pundits are fond of describing President Trump in extreme terms, often calling him unpresidential, unorthodox and aggressive — and from the moment he took office. Critics are not comfortable with his candid Twitter missives; they are insulted when he does not dutifully telegraph his plans to one and all. But this is a complicated world. It is possible that Mr. Trump’s style is calculated, canny, productive — and the work of a businessman, politician and showman who embraces asymmetrical warfare on a global stage. “Is Donald Trump’s unpredictability an advantage in handling North Korea? The North Koreans are used to being the ones who play the crazy card,” writes Issac Chotiner, a Slate staff writer who is interested, he says, in “the reasons for China’s large influence over North Korea, whether the current North Korean regime is rational, and why Trump’s bluster — ‘the crazy card’ — might be beneficial.” So how does North Korea react to Mr. Trump? “I think they perceive him as very unpredictable, which is perhaps not a bad thing. By being impetuous and tweeting all sorts of implied threats, he’s scaring them and also scaring the Chinese. As I said, that’s their card. That’s the favorite card in the playbook. The fact that he’s stolen it or is playing their game is, I think, putting them kind of off. They don’t know how to interpret it,” Barbara Demick told the publication. She is New York bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, and also the author of the 2010 book “Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.” Ms. Demick later reiterated, “I think Trump has scared the North Koreans, and I think he’s even more so scared the Chinese. The Chinese are quite risk-averse. The Chinese Communist Party really wants stability on that border, and if they’re convinced that Trump could do something serious, I think they will be more cooperative. He’s tried various techniques with the Chinese, and he’s offered concessions on trade. I think he’s making it clear that he’s very serious about this. Oh my God, here I am, defending Donald Trump.” TWITTER PHENOMENON OF THE DAY #ThanksBill — Twitter hashtag immediately launched by fans of Bill O’Reilly following his formal dismissal Wednesday as a longtime Fox News Channel host CANNABIS GOES TO CONGRESS A cultural moment that truly would have amazed the old hippies of yore. DCMJ, an interest group promoting “equal rights” for marijuana growers and users in the nation’s capital, is planning its own “joint session” at the U.S. Capitol at high noon on Thursday. It is described by organizers as “a free cannabis giveaway for Capitol Hill staff and media” to call on House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Congress to “reauthorize the RohrabacherFarr amendment, which prohibits the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds to step in or interfere with D.C. and state medical cannabis laws.” The group plans to “lawfully” distribute 1,000 marijuana joints to members of Congress, congressional staffers, credentialed journalists, support staff, interns and 21-or-older Capitol Hill workers with congressional identification. “Two free joints per valid congressional ID,” advise Adam Eidinger and Nikolas Schiller, co-founders of the host organization, who also advise this will all take place on “non-federal land” near the Capitol. WARREN UPS THE ANTE Republican Party observers say that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has just embarked on a tour to promote her new book, “This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle for America’s Middle Class.” But she is receiving tepid reviews for her work, intended as a way to burnish her political brand and prepare for 2018 midterm elections and a possible 2020 presidential run. The GOP observers cite a few succinct examples of those reviews. Among them: The Atlantic said the author practices “faux folksiness” in the book, and sidesteps her own role in Democratic Party mistakes that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s loss of the White House. The Boston Globe noted “all the material she left out,” adding, “the Massachusetts senator trains her scrappy prose on corporations and Republicans while notably pulling her punches on the Democratic Party’s stunning failures of 2016.” UNPRECEDENTED TRUMP BASHING Biased, negative news coverage of President Trump could not get much worse. “As President Trump approaches the end of his first 100 days in office, he has received by far the most hostile press treatment of any incoming American president, with the broadcast networks punishing him with coverage that has been 89 percent negative,” write Rich Noyes and Mike Ciandella, both analysts for Newsbusters.org, a conservative press watchdog. In a new study, the pair pored over evening news coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC from Jan. 20 through April 9 — over 1,000 stories focused on Mr. Trump and his new administration. That amounted to 1,900 minutes of total airtime. Only 186 minutes were positive in content or tone. “The networks largely ignored important national priorities such as jobs and the fight against ISIS, in favor of a news agenda that has been dominated by anti-Trump controversies and which closely matches what would be expected from an opposition party,” the researchers said. The study found that Mr. Trump’s push to invigorate the economy and bring back American jobs received a mere 18 minutes of coverage, and his efforts to facilitate international trade deals resulted in less than 10 minutes of airtime. “Eight years ago, in contrast, the broadcast networks rewarded new President Obama with mainly positive spin, and spent hundreds of stories discussing the economic agenda of the incoming liberal administration,” the analysts said, noting that in Mr. Obama’s first 100 days in office, coverage ranged from 58 percent to 82 percent positive. POLL DU JOUR • 48 percent of Americans say the Republican Party is best able to handle the threat of terrorism; 36 percent cite the Democratic Party. • 46 percent say Republicans are best able to handle gun policy; 41 percent cite Democrats. • 46 percent say Republicans best handle the economy; 43 percent cite Democrats. • 44 percent say Republicans best handle taxes; 43 percent cite Democrats. • 28 percent say Republicans best handle the environment; 59 percent cite Democrats.

Inside the Beltway: Analyst tells Republican Congress to stop wasting Trump’s time
.B
“The Republican Congress must get its act together now. They have the House, they have the Senate, they have the presidency — and nothing’s happening. The Republicans in the legislature are a disgrace,” writes Roger L. Simon founder of PJ Media. “They can’t get it together to compromise on anything and move forward — no tax reform, no healthcare, no nothing. They are overwhelmed by a combination of overweening ego and rigid ideology, a lethal cocktail. Their behavior is creating an inevitable situation where they lose control of Congress and ultimately the White House to the Democrats, when they had everything handed to them. Evidently, the Republicans can’t stand prosperity. Or maybe they really are the Stupid Party,” Mr. Simon writes. The Democratic Party, Mr. Simon continues, “is worse than it ever was — an amalgamation of aging Marxist professors, snowflake social justice warriors with an allergy to free speech, thugs in Guy Fawkes masks who smash windows and pick fights with just about anybody for no discernible reason, leftover identity politics — do we seriously want to give control back to them?” Mr. Simon warns that the GOP risks losing its bedrock voters, and urges Republican lawmakers to tend to such core issues as tax reform, health care and major economic concerns — particularly the moody stock market, “Stop being selfish, stop being egotistical, stop being excessively affixed to one ideology or another and get back to work!” Mr. Simon proclaims, adding, “Stop wasting President Trump’s and everybody else’s time with what is — believe it or not — the small stuff. Pass the legislation and move on. Your fellow Americans will be grateful.” THE WOES OF RYAN “Amid the collapse of the Affordable Care Act repeal in the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul Ryan’s image is taking a hit — 39 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the House speaker, down nine percentage points from November. Ryan’s unfavorable rating has increased 12 percentage points,” writes Art Swift, a Gallup poll analyst. Two-thirds of Republicans still stand by Mr. Ryan, a sentiment unchanged since the election. Thirty-nine percent of independent give him the nod, down five percentage points. “A chief reason favorable ratings have dropped for Ryan is that Democratic support has cratered. While never high, his favorable rating among Democrats has fallen to 14 percent, from 39 percent in November,” Mr. Swift notes. “With tax reform and a budget on the House agenda in the coming months, Ryan will have his hands full contending with a tempestuous majority and a minority with an eye toward the 2018 congressional elections. A key to Ryan’s survival as speaker will be in maintaining GOP support in Congress, something that former House speaker John Boehner was unable to do.” A CLASSY PARTY The 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee reveals it raised $106,715,308.29 for the 2017 inauguration, and duly reported this to the Federal Election Commission. The events in January proved to be among “the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history,” the commission says. Among those events: A free opening concert, free parade tickets, free admission to the Armed Services Inaugural Ball and tickets priced at $50 for the other official galas. The committee also gave broadcasters complete access and coverage to freely air the inaugural balls worldwide. Now that the hubbub is over, the committee will begin the process of donating “excess monies raised” to charity. NEXT TIME TRY JOHN OR MARY A most interesting analysis from the Hollywood Reporter: Power baby names. The industry publication has identified the most popular baby names among the, uh, rich and powerful. “Elite parents in urban areas lean toward very fashion-forward and sophisticated names. They are attracted to quirky, not so easy to like names that are more difficult to embrace,” says Pamela Redmond Satran — an author of 10 baby name guides who adds that “elite naming” hinges on the unusual. Except maybe in the nation’s capital perhaps, where the top four baby power names are: Sam, Charlotte, Jack and Lily. In Los Angeles, however, the top four are: Zen, River, Story and James — the last of which is now considered a girl’s name. And finally, in New York City, the quartet of infant power monickers are: Dashiell, Sophie, Matilda and Ophelia. HAPPY WITH TRUMP’S ‘BUY AND HIRE AMERICAN’ President Trump is winning applause for his executive order to “Buy American and Hire American” executive order which upholds both U.S. workers and investment in domestic products. “America has always been at its strongest when the middle class prospers. By investing in American manufacturers and their products, those companies can return good jobs to the working men and women of the middle class,” the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, said in a statement Tuesday. “The order also addresses the flaws in the H-1B visa program which is in desperate need of reform as employers continue to exploit this program to undermine good jobs and wages that should go to qualified American candidates.” Other organizations also offered their support, including United Steel Workers, Federation for American Immigration Reform and Coalition for a Prosperous America. FOXIFIED For the 15th week in a row, Fox News is ranked No. 1 across the cable realm, besting such rivals as Nickelodeon and HGTV, according to new Nielsen Media Research numbers. Fox News is also No. 1 in the coveted prime time hours for 12 out of the last 13 weeks. The Fox Business Network continues to grow its audience, and has now beaten rival CNBC for the 14th consecutive week. POLL DU JOUR • 66 percent of Americans have never donated to an environmental charity. • 49 percent are concerned that daily activities like commuting or buying groceries will affect the environment; 45 percent are not concerned. • 43 percent prefer groceries in plastic bags; 33 percent prefer reusable bags, 21 percent paper bags. • 41 percent will not participate in Earth Day, which is Saturday; 21 percent are undecided about it. • 15 percent will go on a nature walk, 14 percent to a park, 13 percent will garden, 8 percent will plant a tree, 7 percent volunteer for a community clean-up.

Inside the Beltway: The positive outcome of Trump’s steel-clad tactics
.B
Half the nation’s voters now approve of President Trump according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll which finds that, indeed, 50 percent of likely U.S. voters applaud his job performance. It is the first time Mr. Trump’s ratings have been in the 50s in almost a month, the pollster says, noting that his positive numbers have ranged as high as 59 percent since Inauguration Day. This new bump in approval follows Mr. Trump’s steadfast, steel-clad appearances on the global stage as he dealt with both Syria and North Korea in recent days. He made his point without chatty media appearances and carefully worded talking points. Mr. Trump still favors no-frills tactics. Will there be a U.S. military strike against North Korea? That is what Fox News correspondent Ainsley Earhardt asks Mr. Trump in an interview which airs on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday. “I don’t want to telegraph what I’m doing or what I’m thinking. I’m not like other administrations, where they say, ‘We’re going to do this in four weeks.’ It doesn’t work that way,” Mr. Trump replied. “We’ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there’s going to be peace. But they’ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time.” They? Mr. Trump was referring to both the Clinton and Obama administrations. “Everybody has been outplayed. They’ve all been outplayed by this gentleman, and we’ll see what happens. I just don’t telegraph my moves,” the president advised. Mr. Trump does offer terse insight when necessary, however. Asked by CNN’s Jim Acosta on Monday if he had a message for North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, the president simply replied, “He’s gotta behave.” HILLARY’S ‘DOOMED CAMPAIGN’ ARRIVES The latest Hillary-themed book hits the shelves Tuesday and could well to blaze a path to the most-read roster. “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Jonathan Allen and Amie Banes has been rated No. 1 in several politics and government categories on Amazon well before its publication. “No explanation of defeat can begin with anything other than the core problem of Hillary’s campaign — the candidate herself. ‘Shattered’ will offer an object lesson in how Hillary herself made victory an uphill battle, how her difficulty articulating a vision irreparably hobbled her impact with voters, and how the campaign failed to internalize the lessons of populist fury from the hard-fought primary against Bernie Sanders,” publisher Crown Books advises in advance notes. The new book will face political competition on The New York Times Bestseller List when the time comes. Currently No. 1 in the non-fiction realm: “Old School: Life in the Sane Lane” by Bill O’Reilly and Bruce Feirstein, described as a defense of old school traditional values versus those of the ultra-sensitive “snowflakes” generation. Also in the top-10 is “Nevertheless” by actor and frequent Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin. Another book is making some headway through the treacherous publishing seas. “Drain the Swamp: How Washington Corruption is Worse then You Think,” by Rep. Ken Buck is also appearing in the top political categories at Amazon, complete with a cover than includes the U.S. Capitol and an alligator. “It is an insular process directed by power-hungry party elites who live like kings and govern like bullies,” the Colorado Republican writes. REPEATING THE MAMMO-MYTH “Two years ago, the Washington Post ‘Fact Checker’ declared it was a ‘Three Pinocchios’ lie to claim (or imply) Planned Parenthood offers mammograms. Boss Cecile Richards admitted they while they do breast exams, they have no mammogram machines. They said ‘supporters should drop this talking point.’ But the most liberal news outlets still spread this untruth,” writes Tim Graham, executive editor of NewsBusters, the conservative press watchdog. He cites a new National Public Radio report on Planned Parenthood which listed mammograms among Planned Parenthood’s services, also referring to President Trump’s efforts to defund the organization. The report, Mr. Graham says, ultimately supported a persistent, politicized narrative. “This is part of an overall trend among Republican legislators and President Trump who’ve been showing a lot of hostility towards women’s reproductive health,” NPR’s health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak noted on the air. “NPR spreads the old lie that Planned Parenthood offers mammograms. There was no balance in this report,” Mr. Graham said, equating the correspondent with “a publicist for Planned Parenthood.” THE HALLS OF IVY A group of Arizona State University recently opted to organize a protest against President Trump instead of taking their final exam. They marched around with signs and formed a nifty “human wall,” eventually attracting bystanders interested in speaking out against sexism and the prison system, among other social issues. The students had the blessing of their professor Angeles Maldonado, whose class is titled “Global Politics of Human Rights.” She views the demonstration as a “group protest,” according to the Arizona Republic, which covered the event. “This is better than a final,” one student advised the news organization. “It’s Trump bashing for credit,” observes Lukas Mikelionis, who covers culture for Heat Street. POLL DU JOUR • 57 percent of Americans say Democrats in Congress are doing “too little” to work with the Trump administration; 84 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats agree. • 34 percent overall say the Democrats outreach is “about right”; 11 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats agree. • 5 percent overall say the Democrats have done “too much” outreach; 2 percent of Republicans and 6 percent of Democrats agree. • 53 percent of Americans overall say the Trump administration is doing too little to work with Democrats in Congress; 20 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats agree. • 36 percent overall say the administration’s outreach is about right; 64 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats agree. • 7 percent overall say its outreach is too much; 12 percent of Republicans and 3 percent of Democrats agree.

Media undermines White House Easter Egg Roll
.B
A round of applause, please, for President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who greeted some 21,000 guests on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday, beginning at 7:30 a.m. sharp. The pair are honoring tradition as hosts of the 139th annual White House Easter Egg Roll, which features 18,000 Easter eggs and three separate waves of young guests who will be arriving well into the afternoon. Things are snippy in the mainstream press, meanwhile. Apparently  overwhelmed by nostalgia for the previous administration, much of the  news media is producing less-than-friendly coverage for Monday’s  festivities, implying that this year’s celebration has been ill-planned  and is less elaborate than in years past. Indeed, big-name celebrities  are not being touted — perhaps a refreshing Trump touch in the eyes of  many Americans. But this has happened before. The coverage of the egg  roll is similar to what the president received during his inauguration,  which focused on patriotism and local talent rather than spectacle. That  was not enough for some journalists. Meanwhile, social media is percolating with politicized comments  about the event; such Twitter hashtags as #EasterEggRoll and  #WhiteHouseEasterEggRoll have already been utilized as a springboard by  critics. Yes, the customary commemorative wooden White House Easter eggs have been produced for the occasion in hues of gold, robin’s egg blue, pink, pale yellow and sky blue. They are simple but handsome, produced by Wells Wood Turning & Finishing, the same Maine company that previously supplied the keepsakes. The White House Historical Association now reports that the souvenir egg supply, for the moment, is sold out. Which tells you something. Still, Katie Couric could not resist asking Wells Wood President Chris Chandler about the phenomenon of the gilded eggs. “Of course a gold egg seems very Donald Trump. Do you know if this was his personal request?” inquired Ms. Couric. An affable Mr. Chandler had no idea and said so, while also informing the independent broadcaster that there had been other golden eggs made for other White House administrations in the past. So no potential scandal there. Despite such hubbub, the egg roll is on a roll, and went forward bright and early Monday with style, good cheer and the help of 500 devoted volunteers, hand-packed goody bags, staffers, U.S. military bands, a family band from Tennessee and another from New Jersey. See the friendly doings streamed livestreamed here. FOR THE LEXICON “The New Birtherism” This progressive obsession with President Trump’s tax returns is the new trend identified by Breitbart.com Senior Editor Joel B. Pollak, this following a weekend of well-organized protests in multiple cities demanding that Mr. Trump share his tax records. “The protesters seem undeterred by the embarrassing failure of a recent ‘scoop’ by Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, who claimed to have found Trump’s tax returns — only to reveal a 2005 return that showed Trump paying $38 million in federal taxes on $150 million of income,” writes Mr. Pollak, who also notes that Rep. Maxine Waters, California Democrat, used the tax return rally in the nation’s capital Saturday “as an opportunity to renew her calls for Trump’s impeachment.” VEEP WATCH Vice President Mike Pence remains on an ambitious four-nation overseas tour in the Asia-Pacific region at the moment, accompanied by his wife Karen and their two daughters, Audrey and Charlotte. On Monday Mr. Pence winds down his visit to Korea and prepares to depart for Tokyo, where the ever-gracious but Indiana-tough Mr. Pence will meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and later conduct the first-ever U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. That sounds promising; there is also a “listening session” on the agenda. Mr. Pence also will bolster confidence that the U.S. remains a strong ally to the region, and that the American military is on the comeback trail. To that end, Mr. Pence will have a grand tour of the USS Ronald Reagan, a 1,092-foot aircraft carrier that can carry 90 aircraft. The motto here is “Peace through strength,” a favorite of the 40th president himself. “USS Ronald Reagan is America’s flagship: a visible symbol of America’s commitment to our allies and of our nation’s resolve to maintain international security and stability. We will be ready when needed, where needed to fight and win!” commanding officer Capt. Buzz Donnelly advises crew members in the vessel’s guiding principles. Mr. Pence will address that crew as well as Japanese service members, and then it’s off to Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday. TOM AND BERNIE’S ROAD SHOW Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez launches the weeklong “Come Together and Fight Back Tour” on Monday in Portland, Maine. Accompanied by Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, Mr. Perez intends to rally his fellow progressives with grass-roots zeal in pivotal states. “Bernie and I will be talking directly to voters about how the Democratic Party is fighting for you,” he advised potential rallygoers in the weekly Democratic address released Saturday. “We’re hitting seven states in six days, and we’d love to see you.” Mr. Sanders is along for the entire tour. On the itinerary: the aforementioned Maine stop, followed by rallies in Louisville, Kentucky; Miami; Grand Prairie, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; and Salt Lake City. HEADLINE OF NOTE “Taxes in Nordic countries are so simple, people do them by text message.” — from Chris Weller, a Business Insider analyst, on Sunday. POLL DU JOUR • 62 percent of Americans say it bothers them “a lot” when some corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes; 44 percent of Republicans and 75 percent of Democrats agree. • 60 percent overall say it bothers them when some wealthy people don’t pay their share; 40 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats agree. • 43 percent overall say the complexity of the tax system bothers them a lot; 39 percent of Republicans and 49 percent of Democrats agree. • 27 percent overall say the amount people pay in taxes bothers them a lot; 21 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of Democrats agree. • 20 percent overall say they are bothered if some poor people don’t pay their share; 26 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of Democrats agree.

The MOAB factor: Mother of All Bombs lands right in the media
.B
The news media is always poised to deploy its own bombs on select targets. There was authentic hubbub, however, when word emerged that the U.S. had dropped a 30-foot, 21,600-pound, GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) on an Islamic State target in Afghanistan. Fueled by both wonder and incredulity, journalists scrambled after “MOAB” — dubbed the “Mother of all Bombs” by the Pentagon itself. Headlines and social media immediately erupted; #MOAB and #MotherOfAllBombs instantly appeared on Twitter garnering thousands of mentions. There was some mirth as well. “Next they are going to drop the mother-in-law of all bombs, which will nag ISIS into submission,” tweeted Jim Antle, Washington Examiner politics editor. “ISIS gets the MOAB. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch,” noted National Review writer David French, who later added, “I’m betting that the blast and the mushroom cloud from the MOAB are going to start ‘America dropped a nuke’ rumors all over the region.” “Are people mad that Trump bombed ISIS? Were we supposed to send James Taylor?” quipped talk radio host Dana Loesch. The bomb also became an attack device of a different sort, used to criticize President Trump. One missive from a Georgia-based Democratic group deemed the bomb “the mother of all distractions,” claiming the event only drew public attention from “Russiagate.” Other variations declared the bomb to be a ruse to hide an undesignated “mother of all scandals.” Meanwhile, the most popular headline of all proved to be “What is MOAB?”, decked out fancy infographics, special reports and old Air Force video footage. Things grew complicated once the media discovered the existence of “FOAB,” the “Father of All Bombs” — a thermobaric weapon developed by Russia and thought to be four times as powerful as MOAB. And as a kind of finale, journalists skirmished over MOAB vs. MOP. For the uninitiated, MOP stands for GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator — a bunker-busting bomb about 8,000 pounds heavier than MOAB. MR. PENCE ON THE MOVE Things are about to get very busy for Vice President Mike Pence. Accompanied by his wife, Karen, and two daughters Charlotte and Audrey, Mr. Pence departs Saturday on a major 10-day tour which includes stops in South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and Hawaii. The trip will “emphasize President Trump’s continued commitment to U.S. alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region, highlight the administration’s economic agenda, and underscore America’s unwavering support for our troops at home and abroad,” according to the White House. There are also many “listening tours” and encounters with the local business communities on the agenda. The Pence family will spend Easter Sunday in Seoul with U.S. and Korean troops, and the vice president will meet with acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn. Then it’s on to Tokyo and time with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and an on-board tour of the USS Ronald Reagan. Next up is Jakarta, Indonesia and face time with President Joko Widodo, followed by a visit to Sydney, Australia, and a meeting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The vice president arrives in Honolulu on April 24 to meet with senior leadership from the Pacific Command, visit the USS Arizona Memorial and spend time with U.S. troops and their families. Then it’s home to Washington. NEWS FROM ELSEWHERE The United States Concealed Carry Association recently met in Fort Worth, Texas, to honor products they consider to be the best in the industry. Curious? The Wisconsin-based interest group named the Glock 19 as the “top firearm” because of its versatility and reduced size. The “best holster” award went to the Crossbreed IWB SuperTuck, a waistband holster deemed the most comfortable and concealable. The winner in the “top ammo” division was Hornady Critical Defense Ammunition, cited for proven performance and reliability. The title of “National 2nd Amendment Hero” went to Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. “His pro-gun stance has made him the target of many national anti-gun groups, all of whom have tried to have him removed from office. So far, he has beaten every challenger, no matter how well-funded by outsiders who would push an anti-gun agenda,” says Tim Schmidt, president and founder of the organization. A TAXING SITUATION One street in the nation’s capital will be crowded Saturday. Progressive activists will stage a “Tax March” along Pennsylvania Avenue from the U.S. Capitol past the Trump International Hotel, just three blocks from the White House — then it’s on to the Lincoln Memorial. MoveOn.org and a coalition of 27 other groups are the organizers, and they are obsessed by one idea: President Trump’s tax returns. “What are you hiding? We need a president who works for all Americans, and a tax system that does, too. Release your tax returns and commit to a fair tax system for the American people,” the coalition says in a joint statement. “Feel free to wear your own costumes/outfits and bring your own clever signs!” the organizers advise participants. Speakers include Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Maxine Waters of California plus such supporting organizations as the Endangered Species Coalition, the American Federation of Teachers, the Working Families Party and the National Domestic Workers Alliance. “We don’t know very much about our president, his financial entanglements, or his taxes because he refuses to reveal them,” notes Ms. Waters. WEEKEND REAL ESTATE At public auction: The Minneapolis Shoal Light Station, built in 1934 on northern Green Bay, near Big Bay de Noc, Michigan. On National Register of Historic Places; 26,000 square-feet, includes lighthouse keeper’s quarters, cellar, machine rooms.

Judgment call: Hillary’s 2016 campaign was ‘doomed’
.B
There’s a stark new judgment call on the 2016 election in a forthcoming book, and the title tells all: “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign.” Authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes detail the former Democratic presidential hopeful’s efforts to win the White House in a story that amounts to a brutal close-up. Mr. Allen is a veteran political writer with time spent at Politico, Bloomberg News and Vox. Ms. Parnes is senior White House correspondent for The Hill — which has offered a helpful preview of the book. “Hillary was so mad she couldn’t think straight. She was supposed to be focused on the prep session for that night’s Univision debate in Miami, but a potent mix of exhaustion and exasperation bubbled up inside. She’d been humiliated in the Michigan primary the night before, a loss that not only robbed her of a prime opportunity to put Bernie Sanders down for good but also exposed several of her weaknesses,” the authors write, offering details about the “browbeating” of staffers and the failures of pollsters. “While the campaign projected a drama-free tenor, it was reminiscent of other moments of frustration. Months earlier, Hillary Clinton turned her fury on her consultants and campaign aides, blaming them for a failure to focus the media on her platform. In her ear the whole time, spurring her on to cast blame on others and never admit to anything, was her husband. Neither Clinton could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations,” the authors say, noting that there was no arguing with former President Bill Clinton. “We got an a**-chewing,” a participant said, recalling one conference call in particular. “It was hard to tell what was worse — getting hollered at by Bill or getting scolded by the stern and self-righteous Hillary,” Ms. Parnes and Mr. Allen write. The 480-page book arrives Tuesday. Publisher Crown advises that the action moves “blow-by-blow from the campaign’s difficult birth through the bewildering terror of election night.” DIRECTOR POMPEO TAKES THE STAGE It is a significant appearance during a very jittery week. On Thursday CIA director Mike Pompeo leads an hourlong discussion on national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, just a few blocks north of the White House. This invitation-only event’s guest list quickly filled to capacity and is destined to draw intense interest from a curious, critical press. Mr. Pompeo will be introduced by John Hamre, president and CEO of the host organization; the moderator is Juan Zarate, chairman of the Financial Integrity Network. Everyone here bristles with credentials, including Mr. Pompeo, a former four-term Republican congressman from Kansas who served on the House Select Committee on Benghazi. But wait, there’s much to know: Mr. Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point, went to Harvard Law School following combat duty in Europe and the Middle East, and later founded two successful businesses. Since he was confirmed as CIA director, Mr. Pompeo predictably has been subjected to news coverage rife with anonymous sources and suggestions of discord within the Trump administration, by now a familiar old theme. Now Mr. Pompeo will have his say. C-SPAN will cover it; the event also will be livestreamed at CSIS.org. Showtime is 3:30 p.m. EST. THE BERLIN WALL GETS A WALL “What remains of the Berlin Wall, a formidable barrier that separated East from West for 28 years until it was pulled down in 1989, is now getting its own barrier to protect it from tourists. A permanent railing is being installed in the German capital to stop visitors from leaving their own historic mark on it — or from taking a little Cold War relic home with them,” says Catherine Hickley, a reporter for The Art Newspaper, a New York City-based publication. The wall was designated a heritage site in 1990. Still, the longest intact portion of the wall still standing faces threats from property development and vandalism. Local authorities now have agreed to erect a protective barrier — complete with warnings in several languages forbidding visitors to touch, decorate or break off pieces of the original wall. AND WORD ON ANOTHER WALL President Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico has a starting point: the San Diego border community of Otay Mesa, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. The federal agency put out a request for bids from builders interested in vying for the massive project, and some 450 companies stepped forward last week to apply. And the particulars? The prototype walls must be 30 feet long and up to 30 feet high, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune. “Construction of the models, which will likely take place in June, may attract protesters, but law enforcement officials said they were committed to supporting 1st Amendment rights,” the newspaper noted. “Officials declined to say if officers or deputies would be on site while the construction takes place, but made clear the location will be monitored by law enforcement agencies and Customs and Border Protection.” CHRISTIE’S ADVICE TO SCHUMER Rush Limbaugh thinks President Trump will be able to build his “big beautiful wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border. So does New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who insists Mr. Trump will find the funds for the border barrier despite repeated protests and pushback from Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer. “I think the president will be able to figure out a way to pay for it whether Senator Schumer likes it or not,” Mr. Christie told Fox News. “That’s part of the president’s skill. It’s a multitrillion-dollar budget. I think the president will be able to find his way through, and Sen. Schumer is still fighting the election results. I mean, enough already. The election was months ago.” POLL DU JOUR • 74 percent of U.S. voters say the United Nations should be “doing more” to end the civil war in Syria. • 70 percent support tighter economic sanctions on the Syrian government. • 63 percent say the U.S. should be doing more to end the civil war; 61 percent say the same of Russia. • 57 percent support more U.S. airstrikes against targets in Syria. • 44 percent support U.S. ground troops in Syria to “combat Islamic extremists.” • 39 percent support U.S. ground troops to “remove current President Bashar Assad from power.” Source: A Morning Consult/Politico poll of 1,988 registered U.S. voters conducted April 6-9.

Destiny: Limbaugh predicts Trump’s border wall will become a tourist destination
.B
President Trump has vowed to build a “big, beautiful wall” between the U.S. and Mexico to curtail illegal immigration. His fans love this campaign promise — his critics tear it to pieces. Practical penny-counters shudder over the idea — diplomats shrug. Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh still believes the border wall is a possibility, and now adds an interesting dimension to it, based on Mr. Trump’s capacity for surprise and innovation. “I think the wall is going get built, somehow, some way,” Mr. Limbaugh told his 10 million listeners on Tuesday. Then he began to riff on the idea. “There will be a structure that goes up, and it will have an observation deck, and it will have a sauna, and it will have hot tubs and stuff. It’ll be a tourist attraction. It might even have exclusive Trump hotel suites. You can stay at the wall, you can vacation at the wall. Wouldn’t that be cool if that kind of structure went up? Those are the kinds of things Trump’s known for,” the host continued, then paused to imagine how a combination adventure hotel and border wall would affect the president’s many foes. “That would really frost them,” Mr. Limbaugh noted. NOW THERE’S A THOUGHT “For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions told an audience of Customs and Border Protection agents in Nogales, Arizona, on Tuesday. He had a special message for those who are the true boots-on-the-ground in the region: “We hear you. And we have your back.” The Trump administration has authorized an additional $374 million in funding for the federal agency, which has operated with 1,700 agents below the congressionally mandated minimum of 21,370 agents, this according to the National Border Patrol Council. JOURNALISTS EXPLORE THE WORLD Americans are vexed with the news media for myriad reasons. There’s some insight to be had on the press mindset Wednesday, however. The Newseum — just a few blocks from the White House itself — will stage a half-day event titled “The President and the Press,” which appears to include a cast of thousands. Well, there are 19 journalists on stage, anyway, all intent on exploring President Trump’s relationship during his first 100 days in office and what the future may hold. On hand to parse out the possibilities before a capacity live audience: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Fox News anchor Bret Baier, Breitbart White House correspondent Charlie Spiering, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway — all friendlies. The other 15 high-profile cast members hail from Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, MSNBC, CNN and other news organizations, and they are likely in a challenging mood. The topics include “The press as watchdog,” “Covering the Trump White House,” and “The future of news in a divided and connected world.” Things get underway at 8 a.m. EDT. C-SPAN will cover the event live, and it will be livestreamed from Newseum.org. MCCAUL’S REMINDER House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul notes that the sixth anniversary of the Syrian civil war came and went in late March and that ISIS remains entrenched in that nation, clinging to its “self-declared caliphate.” Things are jittery stateside as well. The Texas Republican also says there is a persistent terrorist threat to America, citing 34 “homegrown jihadist” events in 18 states in the last year which have included public attacks, weapons charges, lying to authorities and financial support for terrorist causes. Find the terror report for April here “We must remain clear-eyed about the threats we face,” says Mr. McCaul. “Islamist terror has been franchised to followers not only in strongholds like Iraq and Syria, but in all corners of the world, and they are using everything from sophisticated explosives to their own vehicles to kill innocent people. We must intensify our efforts to deny these terrorists safe havens abroad, while more aggressively countering jihadist radicalization efforts here in the United States.” A LIBERTY RESOURCE Of interest to the faith-minded: the nonprofit, public interest law firm Becket has launched a helpful new website which features a comprehensive database for all facets of liberty, including free speech, education, cultural battles on the public square and more. Supreme Court victories and precedent-setting cases are also featured, including the legal travails faced by the Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby. Find the new site at Becketlaw.org. FOXIFIED The Fox News Channel continues to do things right. For the 14th consecutive week, the network is dominating the entire cable realm, drawing the largest audiences and besting such competition as ESPN and HGTV. Fox News programs also claim 20 of the Top 30 telecasts in the last week. All five telecasts of “The O’Reilly Factor” last week ranked in the top 10 programs according to Nielsen Media Research. Fox News also outperformed CNN and MSNBC through both day and night; MSNBC, incidentally, is marking the 11th week in a row beating CNN in the crucial prime time hours. POLL DU JOUR • 57 percent of Americans approve of U.S. airstrikes against Syrian military targets; 84 percent of Republicans, 52 percent of independents and 40 percent of Democrats agree. • 45 percent say Syrian use of chemical weapons was “immoral and a direct threat to the U.S.”; 61 percent of Republicans, 41 percent of independents and 39 percent of Democrats agree. • 30 percent would back more airstrikes on Syria, but no U.S. ground troops; 37 percent of Republicans, 30 percent of independents and 25 percent of Democrats agree. • 27 percent want diplomatic talks, and no further U.S. military action; 12 percent of Republicans, 26 percent of independents and 40 percent of Democrats agree. • 18 percent want full U.S. military involvement in Syria; 34 percent of Republicans, 14 percent of independents and 11 percent of Democrats agree. • 15 percent want no U.S. involvement at all; 8 percent of Republicans, 17 percent of independents and 18 percent of Democrats agree.

Bernie Sanders joins a ‘Fight Back Tour’
.B
The Democratic Party is still trying to maneuver heartland values into their corner as the 2018 midterm elections loom. There’s some fancy footwork going on. Democrats appear to be claiming ownership of those very values, which were articulated with great authenticity and genuine verve by President Trump during his successful White House campaign. “As Democrats, we believe that every hardworking American should have an opportunity to get ahead. We believe in standing up for working people, that you should get a fair wage for a hard day’s work and that access to health care is a right, not a privilege. Those are our party’s values, and they’re America’s values — they’re what most people voted for last November,” says Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez in a new public outreach. “We need to turn our party around and get back on track to take on Donald Trump and win elections. But that doesn’t mean changing what it means to be a Democrat,” he adds. “We have to rebuild the Democratic Party from the grass roots up.” Mr. Perez has drafted the help of Sen. Bernard Sanders — the beloved “Bernie” of progressives eager to “feel the Bern” during his presidential campaign, which netted the candidate 13 million popular votes and 1,865 delegates. The Vermont independent is very fond of a big feisty rally, and has already made a few appearances of his own this year to protest the Republican agenda. The Perez/Sanders double bill is now ready. The pair will hit the road next week in a much-ballyhooed “Come Together and Fight Back Tour,” staging vigorous rallies, they say, from Maine to Arizona. It all sounds Trumpian, but no matter. The road trip gets underway Monday; the itinerary is unknown. “We can make the Democratic Party stronger, faster, leaner and feistier so we can fight for the values we all share — and win,” vows Mr. Perez. HARVARD’S EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES Change is descending on the ivy-covered halls. Harvard University has a new contest open to its students, staff and faculty: the “Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging: Revise the Alma Mater.” The organizers are asking the Harvard “community” to rewrite “Fair Harvard,” the school’s anthem, in use since 1836. The short take: University officials no longer want the word “Puritans” to appear in the lyrics, which include the lines “Be the herald of light an the bearer of love, till the stock of the Puritans die.” The song was revised in 1998 to make the lyrics more gender-inclusive, but they left the final line as it was. “We think it’s time for a change,” the campus officials advise. They are also seeking a “new musical variant,” noting that the alma mater tune itself is based on an Irish folk song. Hip-hop, spoken word and electronic versions are welcome; the authorities say they were inspired to tweak the beat and delivery by “Hamilton,” the Broadway musical based on the life and times of Alexander Hamilton. One traditional part of campus culture is safe, however. For now, Harvard’s motto — “Veritas” — can stay. The Latin word for truth “speaks to and on behalf of all members of our community, regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation or viewpoint,” the taskforce notes. DID THEY OR DIDN’T THEY? Americans remain split on whether former President Barack Obama or his inner circle knew that U.S. intelligence agencies were peeking in on President Trump’s campaign last year. A new Rasmussen Report survey finds that 47 percent of likely U.S. voters say it’s likely Mr. Obama or his top aides were aware that the nation’s intelligence agencies were spying on the Trump campaign and transition team. A third say senior members of the Obama administration shared “secretly obtained information about the incoming president and his team” with the media. Among Republican voters, 73 percent say the Obama team knew of the surveillance, and 59 percent of those voters believe secretly obtained information was leaked to the press. “Most Democrats disagree with both of those statements. Voters not affiliated with either political party are more evenly divided on both questions,” the poll analysis noted. THE DHS BURDEN Half of all federal arrests made in 2014 were related to immigration, says a new Pew Research Center analysis of newly released data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Six out of 10 of those arrests were made by the Department of Homeland Security, with Department of Justice essentially picking up the rest. “Just one agency within DHS — Customs and Border Protection — made more arrests in 2014 (64,954) than all of the agencies within DOJ combined (58,265),” the analysis noted. Other federal agencies, such as Treasury Department and the U.S. Postal Service, accounted for 1 percent of the arrests. In addition, 61 percent of all federal arrests occurred in just five federal judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border, the analysis noted. See more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column’s end. SIGN OF THE TIMES “When the enlightened members of the Malibu City Council approved the recent request from actor Martin Sheen to officially make the tony seaside hub an official sanctuary city, they never thought they’d become the butt of a prank joke,” notes the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which monitors immigration policy. Indeed. Just a few days after Mr. Sheen’s request, the official Malibu city limits sign on Pacific Coast Highway sported a new bolted-on addendum that read: “Official Sanctuary City: Cheap Nannies and Gardeners Make Malibu Great!” A consternation and press coverage ensued; local insiders weighed in on the sign phenomenon. “It’s more a jab at all those lazy [expletive] Malibu kids who won’t mow their own grass, mothers that won’t clean their own homes and basically importing all these illegal aliens who are taking unskilled work,” a local political artist named “Sabo” told KABC, an ABC affiliate. POLL DU JOUR • 61 percent of all federal criminal arrests in 2014 involved non-U.S. citizens; 39 percent were U.S. citizens. • 59 percent of these arrests were made by the Department of Homeland Security; 35 percent were made by the Justice Department. • 50 percent of these arrests were immigration-related. • 14 percent were related to drugs, 14 percent to supervision violations. • 8 percent of the arrests were for property crimes such as fraud and embezzlement; 4 percent for weapons offenses.

Inside the Beltway: Trump’s red line
.B
One president now gets to pick up after another’s mess. President Trump’s surgically accurate bombing in Syria has brought him accolades from around the globe, and from unexpected sources on both sides of the aisle. Even a few journalists stepped up to approve. And no wonder. Mr. Trump has set both a practical and moral tone for the nation’s defensive posture — an important step in his bid to make America great again, keep campaign promises and bolster morale. But follow-up tasks and maintenance work on the faded “red lines” of the previous administration are now in order. This portends to be a long march. “There’s a new administration in charge of our national security policy. I applaud the president for doing what he did to enforce that red line that President Obama drew three years ago, but did nothing to enforce,” Sen. John Cornyn told “Fox News Sunday.” The Texas Republican vows to work with fellow lawmakers and the White House on long-term strategy with bipartisan support. “Can Trump clean up Obama’s mess in Syria?” asks a new Investors Business Daily editorial. “President Trump, his hands full in his first 100 days, now must figure out what to do about the Mideast mess that President Obama and his two secretaries of state left — a result of one of the most inept foreign-policy maneuvers in modern history.” The op-ed cited both former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And not in a happy way. “Obama’s strategy is a shambles,” the news organization notes. “The result is chaos and violence across the Mideast, and millions of displaced people and refugees overwhelming Lebanon, Jordan and other Mideastern countries, along with Europe. It is one of the most destabilizing policy moves by a president ever, rivaling even LBJ’s Vietnam buildup in the damage it’s done. When President Obama peremptorily departed a then-mostly-stable Iraq in 2011, he left a power vacuum across a wide swath of Iraq and into northern Syria. Politics abhors a vacuum, and it was filled by ISIS, Russia and Turkey. We’re paying for Obama’s failures today.” AND THE REALITY CHECK The aforementioned attack on Syria may persuade President Bashar al-Assad to be more cautious, but will not deter him and his allies from pressing “a full-throttle military campaign” to counter the rebels, write Tom Perry and Laila Bassam, both Reuters correspondents in the Middle East. “Assad now knows there is a red line with regard to the use of chemical weapons. But I think he also probably just sees it as a slap on the wrist,” David Lesch, professor of Middle East history at Trinity University, told the news service. “Assad has to recalibrate but not fundamentally change his military approach that they’ve been engaging in since the Russian intervention. I really believe they are not feeling too bad today, if this is the extent of what the U.S. is going to do.” TOO LITTLE TOO LATE NBC has “For God and Country.” The CW has “Valor.” They are among the major networks which are suddenly developing military-themed TV shows — so much so that the Hollywood Reporter has already deemed it a “hot TV trend.” It’s amazing that nobody has retooled the “Combat,” a prime time drama, which had considerable appeal during the 1960s. Timing appears to be everything. “All five broadcast networks are piloting military-themed shows this season. Coincidence? Or is it a targeted attempt to reach Trump voters?” asks Sarah Stites, a Media Research Center Culture analyst who reports on entertainment and religion for the conservative watchdog. “It took a devastating electoral upset, but the networks have started to learn some lessons. Shows with affluent protagonists, set in big cities and reflecting liberal ideologies were actually alienating a subset of the American populace,” says Ms. Stites, who wonders if the big networks are now trying to appeal to a broader audience with “traditional, patriotic values.” GUARDED ADMIRATION: ALASKA AND CHINA Chinese President Xi Jinping stopped off in Alaska on his way home, tooling down the Anchorage streets in an entourage that included 24 cars. There’s some history here. Last year alone, Alaska exported $1.2 billion worth of seafood, minerals and other products to China. And these days, Mr. Xi appears interested in sending his nation’s athletes to train in downhill skiing in Alaska for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be in Beijing. Gov. Bill Walker also hosted his guests at dinner in the Crow’s Nest, a world-class restaurant atop the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage where there is king crab, Alaskan-style bouillabaisse and king salmon to be had. “Admiring the view of the Chugach Mountains, Xi asked Walker whether the restaurant, at the top of the hotel, was of the revolving variety. It’s not,” the Alaska Dispatch News said, noting that governor and president went over the finer points of fisheries, air cargo, oil and gas. Mr. Xi appeared upbeat. “He felt that as a result of his coming to Alaska we will see an uptick of tourism from China — and I think he’s correct about that,” Mr. Walker told a press gaggle in the aftermath. ONE FOR THE PUPS A forthcoming book of note: “K-9 Korea: The Untold Story of America’s War Dogs,” which offers the details of the 8125th Sentry Dog Detachment — brave soldiers and hero dogs who relied on one another through the worst of the worst.

Here they come: Democrats eager to woo Trump voters
.B
When Time magazine goes to name their person of the year eight months from now, the publication should award the title to “Trump voters.” The legions of loyal, energized, grass-roots stalwarts who rose up to be counted during the presidential election made their mark — and simultaneously confounded the Democratic Party, pollsters, pundits and the liberal media. They never saw the Trump force coming — and have been in ferocious panic mode ever since the White House went to President Trump just over 11 weeks ago. Yes, the Trump voters are on the radar in a very big way. There is also change afoot. Caught unaware, national pollsters are now tweaking their surveys to gauge the mindset and beliefs of the new Trump demographic. Democrats are huddling with strategists, trying to craft ways to undermine Mr. Trump and lure his followers to the progressive mindset. The media previously offered dismissive coverage of this heartland force. That too is beginning to change. Consider a surprising op-ed by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who is now urging his Democratic readers to “be nice to Trump voters,” advising irate followers of Hillary Clinton to study the victorious group. Mr. Kristof writes that “one problem with Democratic anger is that it stereotypes a vast and contradictory group of 63 million people. Sure, there were racists and misogynists in their ranks, but that doesn’t mean that every Trump voter was a white supremacist.” Mr. Kristof also cautions that “we simply can’t write off 46 percent of the electorate,” and that hatred of Trump voters “leaves the Democratic Party more removed from working-class pain.” Mr. Kristof has penned a canny, cautionary tale here, which does have positive points. But it’s also an indicator that Trump foes are beginning to eye his die-hard supporters with great appetite. The Democrats, essentially, are figuring out ways to woo Trump voters. And those voters should be wary of the trend. “So by all means stand up to Trump, point out that he’s a charlatan and resist his initiatives,” Mr. Kristof advises Democrats. “But remember that social progress means winning over voters in flyover country, and that it’s difficult to recruit voters whom you’re simultaneously castigating as despicable, bigoted imbeciles.” DAYS OF YORE “Presidents come and go, but the Supreme Court goes on forever.” — William Howard Taft, president from 1909 to 1913 and chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1921 to 1930, when he retired due to ill health. He died shortly thereafter at age 72. GOVERNOR TRUMP IN THE MAKING “Donald Trump Jr. wants to run for political office, telling members of an elite gun club that he could set his sights on becoming governor of New York,” reports Emily Smith, a New York Post columnist, who says the younger Mr. Trump revealed his aspirations when speaking to members of the F6 Labs gun club in Hicksville, New York. He’s got his eye more on governor of New York than mayor of New York City or Congress, and has not forgotten the intense campaigning with his father, Ms. Smith reports. “Do I want to be behind the scenes and be a mouthpiece and fight back against crazy liberal media? Maybe,” the younger Mr. Trump told his audience. “Going back to doing deals is boring after 18 months. The politics bug bit me.” THE KASICH AND ROMNEY FACTOR An interesting alliance: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former presidential hopeful. The man who played the Terminator, in fact, has already endorsed Mr. Kasich for the next White House derby. “He should run in 2020. Kasich is an extraordinary guy. He’s a man of substance. He’s worked in Washington, he’s worked in local government, he’s worked in statewide government. He has the experience. He can see things. He has vision,” Mr. Schwarzenegger told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Mr. Kasich has all the traits of a guy pining to get back in the arena. He still has an active campaign site. The governor also has a new book titled “Two Paths: America Divided or United,” which arrives April 25. He intends to “reclaim the America we love and hold so dear,” and plans on delivering “a clarion call to reason and purpose and a clear path toward a more promising tomorrow.” The first stop on Mr. Kasich’s book tour? New Hampshire, of course. There must be something in the air, though. According to a new report from McKay Coppins, a political analyst for Atlantic magazine, none other than Mitt Romney is actively exploring a return to national politics, this time via a U.S. Senate seat in Utah.

Media gets the jitters over Trump’s historic meeting with Xi Jinping 
.B
President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two world leaders have a 24-hour encounter in scenic Palm Beach, Florida, which begins Thursday and could yield significant, possibly historic developments and some fascinating cultural moments. And, of course, the mainstream media is at the ready, pacing back and forth and hoping things go awry in this gorgeous setting. Many journalists already are predicting a negative outcome, or are mired in speculation — obsessing over possible failures, awkward moments, a proverbial clash of the titans and golf. Yes, golf. Needless to say, if the press was reporting on former President Barack Obama rather than Mr. Trump, the coverage would be grand, glowing and noble. Yes, needless to say. Here’s a selection of representative headlines from the last 48 hours: “Trump and Xi: Two imposing leaders with clashing agendas” (The New York Times); “Can Trump Match Xi Jinping’s Game?” (The New Yorker), “The odd couple summit” (Axios); “Trump, Xi will be odd couple at first summit” (CNBC); “Trump’s Mar-a-Lago ethics mess gets worse ahead of Xi Jinping visit” (MSNBC); “Trump faces test mixing Mar-a-Lago with difficult diplomacy” (Politico); “Xi Jinping’s summit plan to tame Donald Trump” (Financial Times); “China’s Xi Jinping will NOT golf with Trump at Mar-a-Lago” (Daily Mail); “Why Trump’s golf diplomacy won’t work with China’s Xi Jinping” (CNN). MEANWHILE, IN PALM BEACH Local authorities in Palm Beach see the first-time meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as a historic occasion. It is not without challenges, however. “In anticipation of hosting two of the most powerful individuals in the world, at the same time, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw says there is a multilayered security plan unlike any he has overseen before,” reports Greg Angel for the local CBS affiliate, noting that the safety measures include 10-foot-tall concrete-and-steel barricades decorated with Chinese and U.S. flags on the roadways. “President Xi will likely face scores of demonstrators and so-called greeters,” Mr. Angel explains. Sheriff Bradshaw is ready. “We are not going to tolerate any civil disobedience, throwing of objects or any type of disorderly conduct whatsoever,” the lawman told the local station. “At first sign of that, it will be dealt with. We will have our mobile jails. We’re not going to let things get out of hand.” FLEETING HOLLYWOOD MOMENT “All the people that are on deck in 2020, none of them are going to win. None of those people are going to beat Donald Trump. You think things are bad now. I [will] tell you when things are going to be worse: if he wins again.” — Actor Alec Baldwin, musing on the presidential field three years from now, to Extra TV FLEETING CLINTON MOMENT A new Rasmussen Reports survey finds that 50 percent of likely U.S. voters think Congress should expand its investigation of any possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government; a close 45 percent say Congress has better things to do. Another 52 percent, however, say former President Bill and Hillary Clinton’s private dealings with Russian officials should be included in any investigation, the survey notes. Life goes on, though. Mrs. Clinton is giving her third speech in a week in New York City on Thursday. She will appear at the “Women in the World” summit at Lincoln Center, an event that includes such speakers as Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards, journalists Katie Couric and Arianna Huffington and Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. CARLY STEPS OUT Add former presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina to the list of those who are not done yet. She still has an active campaign site and a clear mission, she says, to “continue the fight to elect conservatives, reform Washington, and restore a citizen government to our great nation.” Ms. Fiorina — who is considering a 2018 run for a U.S. Senate seat in Virginia — will be the keynote speaker at the Global Good Fund Summit, now underway in the nation’s capital. “Resilience and grit have fueled her lifelong commitment to responsible leadership,” a source says, noting that Ms. Fiorina will address her calling at the event, staged in a historic hotel just a few blocks from the White House, and hosted by the organization’s CEO, Carrie Rich. And on the luncheon menu for the event, which gets underway at nigh noon: heirloom tomatoes with Burrata cheese, micro basil and balsamic drizzle, soy ginger salmon with stir-fried spring pea shoots, plus Italian lemon-zest cake with red berry coulis. A CHEER FOR THE THINKERS Believe it or not, there is public recognition for those who stand for American exceptionalism, free markets, limited government, federalism and personal liberty. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation offers such recognition. On Thursday the Milwaukee-based organization hands out its annual awards to the rare and significant folks whose work reflects those bedrock ideas. In an event in the nation’s capital on Thursday hosted by columnist George Will, the foundation honors a quartet of gents who hail from the academic, legal and media arenas. Receiving a Bradley Prize: Peter Berkowitz, a political scientist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution; Christopher DeMuth, a Hudson Institute fellow; Philip Hamburger, a Columbia Law School professor; and Walter E. Williams, an economics professor at George Mason University. The prize selection committee included Mr. Will, Victor Davis Hanson, Charles Krauthammer and Richard W. Graber, chairman of the foundation.

The media abandons ‘sacred principles of journalism’ to stop Trump
.B
Voters are hard pressed to unravel two concurrent political dramas, both with dire connotations. At their most basic, there are claims that the Obama administration surveilled President Trump’s 2016 campaign — and counterclaims that there was communication between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Both scenarios are subject to spin by pundits and news media. Investigations and conflicting accounts are many, ramped up by calculated distractions, bombshells, cover-ups, leaks and the ongoing battle to control the public narrative. But has the turmoil reached “-gate” status, requiring the designated suffix that has accompanied scandals and improprieties for the last four decades? There’s Watergate of course, and Travelgate, Climategate, Bridgegate and dozens more. The all-purpose “Obamagate” has been circulating as both a Twitter hashtag and popular headline for several weeks. So that’s already taken. “The smoking gun in Watergate was President Nixon’s effort to use the CIA to impede an FBI investigation. What kind of ‘gate’ is the misuse of the intelligence community to get inside information on an opposing presidential candidate?” writes American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Peter J. Wallison in an essay for RealClear Politics. “It may turn out that the Democrats, so eager to prove that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians, have unknowingly blundered into a matter that will come back to damage both their party and the Obama administration.” Talk radio kingpin Rush Limbaugh had a telling prediction for the Democratic Party and the news media itself — a conglomeration he frequently calls the “Democratic media complex,” among other things. “They’re a big hate group now, and they’ve been consumed with their hatred for Donald Trump, consumed with their hatred for the American people who voted for Trump, consumed with their hatred for open elections, consumed by their hatred of the fact they can’t get rid of Trump,” Mr. Limbaugh told his 10 million-member audience Tuesday. “Folks, the only thing I’m telling you is, in terms of humanity, that you do not build good, positive, growing movements from a foundation or platform of hate. And they are consumed by it now. They are ravaged by it, and they have become completely irrational to the point of even openly acknowledging the abandonment of the sacred principles of journalism in order to stop Donald Trump.” SURPRISING HOLLYWOOD MOMENT “DEMS, The Merrick Garland SHIP HAS SAILED!! Let It Go  OR Do You Want Some [cheese emoji] To Go With Your WHINE? This Tantrum Wreaks Of Desperation.” — Tweet from pop icon Cher on Tuesday afternoon, in reference to the Democratic Party’s grief that former Judge Merrick Garland did not make it to the U.S. Supreme Court; he was nominated by former President Barack Obama on March 16, 2016. SCHWARZENEGGER, THE HYBRID STATESMAN Former California governor and action film star Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to position himself as a kind of hybrid statesman, championing a variety of political issues while promoting his latest film “Aftermath,” which opens in theaters nationwide on Friday. And while he has had a few recent squabbles with President Trump, Mr. Schwarzenegger has issued a two-minute protest video against the U.S. Congress, which includes pivotal dialogue from “Conan the Barbarian” and his other signature films to make the point. “We’ve had years with Democrats in charge. We’ve had years with Republicans in charge. One thing has always remained the same: complete and total inaction on the issues routinely rank as their top priorities,” the actor says, giving the lawmakers a resounding grade of “F” — which sounds like it came from Mr. Trump’s playbook. Mr. Schwarzenegger is also very active in his namesake Schwarzenegger Institute, a public policy organization at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Which is where he will be Tuesday. The “Terminator” actor has organized an “Afterschool Summit” to highlight the nation’s many afterschool programs and the role they play in “preparing students to enter the 21st century workforce and compete in the global workplace.” Mr. Schwarzenegger is particularly vexed at Mr. Trump’s proposed funding cuts to afterschool programs, which he says could affect 1.6 million children. “Once again, politicians in Washington are trying to balance the budget on the backs of the hardworking families that depend on these programs,” said Mr. Schwarzenegger. The daylong summit has an extensive guest list that includes Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt, “American Ninja Warrior” host Matt Iseman, “Extra” host Mario Lopez, U.S. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Jody Breckenridge, CNN host Van Jones, American Enterprise Institute fellow Gerard Robinson, Afterschool Alliance Executive Director Jodi Grant and mayors or school superintendents from five states. Mr. Schwarzenegger, incidentally, founded the After-School All-Stars program in 1992 for at-risk children. ROE AT THE READY A round of applause, please, for House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe. The Tennessee Republican has launched a new website to provide updates and information from the committee and, more important, resources for vets. It is a handsome site, minus annoying videos and useless graphics. “Having a mobile-enabled, easy-to-navigate website is critical to communicate the committee’s work to the American people. As we work to bring comprehensive reform to VA, this website will serve as a one-stop shop for updates on the important work the committee is doing on behalf of the men and women who served,” said the lawmaker, who is also a medical doctor and chairman of the House GOP Doctors Caucus. Find the helpful site at Veterans.house.gov. POLL DU JOUR • 94 percent of Americans say they have heard about the tense relationship between President Trump and the news media. • 83 percent say the relationship between Mr. Trump and the media is “generally unhealthy”; 78 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of independents agree. • 87 percent of Hispanics, 86 percent of blacks and 83 percent of whites also agree. • 73 percent of Americans say the tension between Mr. Trump and the media hinders Americans’ access to important political news; 73 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of independents agree. • 75 percent of Hispanics, 74 percent of blacks and 74 percent of whites also agree.

Persistent patriotism: 92% of Republicans ‘extremely proud’ to be American
.B
It is a happy finding for the GOP: A new Gallup poll reveals that 92 percent of Republicans are “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American. Things are not so fervent among Democrats on the patriotic meter: 67 percent said they were proud, along with 73 percent of independents. Among all Americans, the number was 75 percent. “The percentage of Democrats saying they are proud is the lowest Gallup has measured to date, falling below the previous low of 74 percent recorded in January 2007,” writes Gallup analyst Jeffrey Jones, who blames the decline in Democratic pride to the election of President Trump. “Historically, Democrats’ patriotism appears to have been susceptible to considerations such as which party occupies the White House and how the U.S. is faring internationally, while Republicans’ patriotism has been more consistent over time. Therefore, for U.S. pride to bounce back to where it has been in the past, renewed feelings of patriotism among Democrats will be necessary,” Mr. Jones notes in the survey analysis. THE SHOW MUST GO ON President Trump will not be attending the White House Correspondents Dinner on April 29. That we know. There has been some chatter that Alec Baldwin could show up and reprise his oft-repeated impersonation of Mr. Trump. There’s also been speculation that Hillary Clinton and even former President Barack Obama could appear. Whatever the case, C-SPAN announced Tuesday that it would cover the mammoth event as usual, and that’s that. The organizers of the fete — which features a red-carpet walk, 3,000 guests, a sumptuous meal and a dozen after-parties — insist the dinner will “continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic.” Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has won accolades for skipping the event. Powerline.com analyst Steven Hayward called it “Trump’s best decision yet,” while John Hinderaker, a fellow analyst, said: “Couldn’t agree more. This is a stupid event, and Trump is a serious president. There is no reason why he should indulge his enemies.” A LOVELY FIRST LADY She wears a simple black blazer and matching neck scarf, her arms are crossed, her gaze steady. The White House released the first official portrait of first lady Melania Trump on Monday — and it is very nice indeed. Mrs. Trump, who spent years as a high-fashion model, looks both dignified and beautiful, standing before one of the arch-topped lunette windows located in the private residence of the White House. “I am honored to serve in the role of first lady, and look forward to working on behalf of the American people over the coming years,” Mrs. Trump said in a statement issued by the White House. Global media coverage was instant, and most of it was neutral — the image appears to speak for itself. But of course, there was a predictable gaggle of critical scribes who descended to various social media sites to wonder if the photo had been airbrushed, or if Mrs. Trump should have worn her diamond engagement ring. Vogue magazine offered an interesting take — equating both the camera pose and the backdrop to Nancy Reagan’s in a previous era. Mrs. Trump’s many fans were there for her, however. Among the many positive reactions on Twitter: “I am so proud of her,” “absolutely stunning” and “what a beautiful first lady we have.” THE D.C. BASEBALL MENU Baseball season brings out the devoted fans, along with the culinary taste-meisters who judge how good the food is in the nation’s major league stadiums. Such is the case with Eater.com — a foodie’s dream news site — which has reviewed the menus in nine stadiums. The nation’s baseball fans will be well-fed this season. But what about the lawmakers, politicos and other heavy hitters? What will they encounter should they make a visit to Washington’s splendid Nationals Park, just a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol itself? Here’s a sampling of the fare beyond the tasty but typical burgers and hot dogs, compiled by Warren Rojas, who covers food trends in the nation’s capital for the food site: Chicken fried steak sandwiches with country sausage gravy, marinated chicken kabobs with rice, open-face chicken and waffles with bacon, pork belly bao buns, Belgian-style french fries, crab-topped tater tots, Old Bay chicken wings, Italian sausage burgers with caramelized onions, peppers and provolone cheese, hickory smoked baked potatoes plus ice cream flavored with bourbon, cinnamon and bits of babka bread — or crumbled black-and-white cookies. THEY JUST WON’T DO IT Analysts continue to ponder what has gotten into the mainstream news media as they flail against the Trump administration and abandon basic journalism tenets in many cases. The cause may be simple. Dan Gainor, vice president of business and culture at the Media Research Center, has a straightforward theory. “The media has to be more honest — and they don’t want to be. And they don’t really want to be honest about how upset they are. What we’re undergoing is what I’ve been calling in my column each week a national tantrum. The leftist media doesn’t want to wake up, doesn’t want to calm down. They want to celebrate the most radical factions,” Mr. Gainor told Breitbart News radio host Alex Marlow on Monday. Americans, incidentally, have an increasing appetite for all-news cable channels. These numbers are fresh from Nielsen Media Research: U.S. adults collectively watched 27.1 billion minutes of cable news last year, up 44 percent from 2015. On another level, that breaks down to 6.5 hours a week spent watching cable news in 2016 — up 90 minutes from 2015, and up 105 minutes from the 2012 presidential election cycle. POLL DU JOUR • 58 percent of all Americans say the current economic situation in the U.S. is good. • 69 percent of college grads, 67 percent of those who make more than $75,000 a year, 61 percent of men and 61 percent of those age 30-49 agree. • 61 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of those over 50, 55 percent of women and 55 percent of those with a high school diploma also agree. • 54 percent of those with salaries $30,000 to $75,000 think the U.S. economy is good; 52 percent of those with some college training, 51 percent of those who make less than $30,000 a year and 49 percent of those ages 18-29 also agree. • 44 percent of Americans said the economy was good at this time in 2016.

Newspaper calls the president a train wreck:  L.A. Times ‘nearly hysterical’ over Trump
.B
Media analysts wonder just how far the news media will go in their efforts to undermine President Trump. Well, they will go pretty far. National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre recently noted that “organized hatred” is unprecedented against the new administration — “amplified by a national media that has thrown out the rules of journalism and has become a part of the mob.” Strong words. But there are strong words in journalism as well. This week, the Los Angeles Times offers a four-part, unsigned editorial series titled “Our Dishonest President.” The first installment ran Sunday, proclaiming this: “It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a ‘catastrophe.’ Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck.” The Democratic National Committee immediately shared the Times missive in full with its membership — and there are three more to come. Like Hillary Clinton — whose new motto is “resist, insist, persist, enlist” — the Times is issuing a call to battle, ramped up through the vast feedback loop of the Democratic Party itself. “Those who oppose the new president’s reckless and heartless agenda must make their voices heard. Protesters must raise their banners. Voters must turn out for elections,” the paper noted, adding, “All of us who are in the business of holding leaders accountable must redouble our efforts to defend the truth from his cynical assaults.” How does the editorial rate on the Richter scale of livid journalism? Joel B. Pollak, senior editor at large for Breitbart News, says the Los Angeles Times appears to have lost its bearings over the thought of the Trump presidency — and now “has printed a strident, and nearly hysterical editorial.” ‘UNHINGED’ DEMOCRATS ON THE MARCH Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is doing her part to elevate the public discourse following an emotionally charged speech by Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez before a New Jersey progressive organization this weekend. Ms. McDaniel says her counterpart across the aisle is “unhinged.” So what did he say? Among many things, Mr. Perez said that President Trump is “a bully in the White House,” that he does not stand for American values and did not win the election. “Chairman Perez’s comments are dangerous and undermine our democratic process. Perhaps Mr. Perez needs a lesson on how the Electoral College works — but whether he likes it or not, Donald Trump is our president,” Ms. McDaniel points out. “Mr. Perez should be ashamed of himself for insulting the millions of Americans who don’t share his liberal vision for our country. The Democrats are the minority party because of comments like those, and if he thinks this is the way back from the wilderness, he’s sorely mistaken. Mr. Perez should apologize, and Democrats should denounce the rhetoric coming from the new leader of their party,” she concluded. D.C. EAGLES ARE WORLD FAMOUS It is reassuring to know that the world is intensely interested in a pair of American bald eagles who are going about their eagle business at the top of a tulip poplar tree in the U.S. National Arboretum — next door to The Washington Times offices, which overlook the federal property. Via two high-definition nestcams, viewers in 100 nations have peeked at Mr. President and First Lady, now raising their second set of chicks. Over 70 million have viewed the feathered family — “hundreds of thousands of people were glued to their computers and mobile devices” when the fuzzy gray eaglets hatched five days ago, says the American Eagle Foundation, a Tennessee-based nonprofit that operates the cameras in the nation’s capital and near eagle nests in three other states. “We hope that something as inspiring and endearing as this special eagle family will help America to momentarily put their political differences and disagreements aside to share and enjoy together the importance, wonder, and meaning of their symbolic National Bird,” notes Al Cecere, president of the foundation. AMBASSADOR HALEY STANDS FAST Unflappable U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has gotten high marks for her refreshing candor and backbone on the global stage in recent weeks. She also lends insight about the insular population in the nation’s capital. In an appearance on “Face the Nation” on CBS Sunday, host John Dickerson asked about the possibility of Russian intervention in the 2016 election, which has preoccupied Washington insiders for weeks. “None of my colleagues or ambassadors from other countries are talking about D.C. chatter. What they are talking about is the fact that they’re relieved that the United States is starting to lead again,” Ms. Haley replied, later noting that her peers’ main interest was Russia’s influence in Ukraine, Crimea and Syria. She also clarified that the diplomatic crowd is not in an uproar about President Trump’s tweets. “No one’s talking to me about the president’s tweets,” said Ms. Haley, adding, “I think the foreign leaders are picking up the phone and calling him if they have an issue. And that’s what they’re doing with me. If they have an issue, they’re calling me. They’re not sitting there texting me and saying, ‘What was this tweet about?’” POLL DU JOUR • 50 percent of Americans say it is not likely that President Trump’s offices “were wiretapped during the 2016 campaign”; 24 percent of Republicans, 49 percent of independents and 74 percent of Democrats agree. • 47 percent of Americans overall say it is likely Mr. Trump’s offices were wiretapped; 74 percent of Republicans, 49 percent of independents and 21 percent of Democrats agree. • 40 percent overall say Russia interfered in the 2016 election “to favor Trump“; 13 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents and 67 percent of Democrats agree. • 37 percent overall say there was no Russian interference; 64 percent of Republicans, 36 percent of independents and 16 percent of Democrats agree. • 10 percent overall say Russia interfered in the election “but not to favor Trump“; 13 percent of Republicans, 10 percent of independents and 7 percent of Democrats agree.

Inside the Ring: Cyber sabotage of North Korea’s missiles?
.B
The unsuccessful test launch of a North Korean medium-range missile on Saturday has fueled media speculation the missile blew up as a result of U.S. clandestine cyber attacks. Asked if secret U.S. intervention caused the explosion of the North Korean test launch, White House Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland said Sunday, “We can’t talk about secret intelligence and things that might have been done, covert operations that might have happened.” If U.S. intelligence succeeded in getting into the supply chain used by North Korea to acquire parts for missiles from abroad, the information likely would be held in an ultra-secret special-access program and its disclosure to the public unlikely. Another reason for the missile failures could be North Korea’s shift from liquid fuel to solid fuel, a more challenging technology to master. The U.S. sabotage speculation is based on a New York Times report in March that reported the Trump administration had inherited a secret intelligence operation to conduct cyber and electronic attacks aimed at sabotaging North Korean missile launches. Getting inside North Korea’s homemade missile programs would be very difficult since Pyongyang manufactures several types of short-, medium- and long-range missiles. Still Pyongyang acquires parts from abroad, including China and Russia that could have been intercepted and doctored to sabotage flight tests. The Pacific Command said the North Korean missile was launched at 5:21 p.m. EDT near Sinpo, a port city on the Sea of Japan where North Korea is developing its solid-fueled KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile. “The missile blew up almost immediately,” the command said in a statement. The Sinpo failure was at least the third missile to blow up after launch from that location. Two other failed test launches took place there last year, on April 23 and July 9. On Aug. 24, a KN-11 flew around 310 miles, however. Other failed North Korean missile launches last year included three Nodong medium-range missiles, and six failures of the intermediate-range Musudan missile, according to a United Nations report. Both missiles use liquid fuel. Doubts on Iran nuclear deal Secretary of State Rex Tillerson notified Congress on Wednesday that Iran was complying with the 2015 international agreement on its nuclear program. In the first such review by the Trump administration, Mr. Tillerson stated in a letter to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that Tehran has met the compliance conditions outlined in the 2015 Nuclear Agreement Review Act, passed by Congress amid doubts about the accord. “Notwithstanding, Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror through many platforms and methods,” Mr. Tillerson stated, noting that President Trump ordered an interagency review of the accord known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The review “will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States,” he said. The statement suggests the Trump administration could re-impose sanctions on Iran, something Tehran has said would lead it to pull out of a deal critics say will allow the Islamic republic to develop nuclear arms in 10 years. The Iran deal permits uranium enrichment and calls for “snap-back” sanctions if Tehran fails to abide by its terms, which are aimed at preventing development of nuclear arms. The JCPOA restricts extensive international monitoring to declared nuclear facilities and calls upon Iran to permit inspections when any suspicious facilities are spotted. However, Iran in the past has stymied international monitoring of suspect nuclear sites, like the Parchin facility that was not included in the Iran deal. Parchin, located some 20 miles southeast of Tehran, was the location for most of Iran’s past nuclear arms-related work. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a critic of the Iran deal when he was a Republican member of Congress, said recently that intelligence estimates of Iranian compliance with the nuclear accord remain uncertain. “I don’t want to say much about their compliance with the agreement,” Mr. Pompeo said during remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies last week. “I prefer to present that to the president and let him communicate that. You should know we are actively engaged in a lot of work to assist the president in making sure he has an understanding of where the Iranians are complying and where they might not be.” Mr. Pompeo then suggested Iran could cheat as Syria did in hiding chemical weapons that were required to be given up under an Obama administration-brokered agreement. “We should all be mindful, given what took place in Syria, and go back and read that JCPOA and what it talks about in terms of declared facilities and undeclared facilities, and how much access the IAEA will have to each of those two very distinct groups,” Mr. Pompeo said. “So that might suggest to you what level of certainty we can ever hope to present to the commander-in-chief,” he said. Mr. Pompeo also said the Iran nuclear agreement has not led to a more benign Iran, as agreement supporters predicted would take place. Among the increasing threats are Iran’s growing missile capabilities, as well as Iranian subversion in Iraq and Yemen. “The list of Iranian transgressions has increased dramatically since the date that the JCPOA was signed,” he said. Missile parade shows Chinese launchers North Korea’s large military parade in Pyongyang on Saturday highlighted several new missile developments. Rick Fisher, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, says photo analysis of the parade showed off what appear to be two new long-range solid-fuel missiles on Chinese or Chinese-design launchers. One of the missiles is a medium-range ballistic missile similar in size to the Chinese DF-21 — the weapon Beijing has fashioned into a long-range anti-ship missile. “While the images do not confirm overall Chinese assistance for this new North Korean missile, the truck cab towing the missile is clearly based on the Chinese-made Sinotruk A7 tractor-trailer truck cab design,” said Mr. Fisher. The second missile shown in Pyongyang last week was contained in a much larger tube carried on a 16-wheel mobile launcher made by the Sanjiang Special Truck Corp., part of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp. (CASIC). “The size of this new large missile launch tube indicates North Korea may be developing a new solid-fuel missile larger than the liquid-fueled KN-08 and KN-14 revealed in 2012 and 2014,” Mr. Fisher said. If the Chinese launchers were not transferred directly by Beijing, they may be built indigenously through a China-North Korea joint venture, he said. Further evidence of China-North Korean missile cooperation means “it would be very dangerous to assume that China has indeed changed its longstanding policies of supporting the North Korean regime,” Mr. Fisher said. “Washington should demand that China immediately reveal publicly the full extent of its direct and indirect support for a number of new North Korean weapons, to include the new solid-fuel ICBM, the KN-08/14 liquid-fueled ICBM, the KN-06 fourth-generation anti-aircraft missile and the new precision guided artillery rocket,” he said. — Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

Trump-Xi summit focuses on North Korea
.B
Tensions remain high in Northeast Asia following the dispatch of a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group to waters near the Korean Peninsula and signs that Pyongyang is preparing for another underground nuclear test. The deployment of the carrier USS Carl Vinson followed the summit last week in Florida between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping where North Korea was the major topic of discussion. Both leaders exchanged views on their assessment of the problem, but “there was mutual agreement the problem has become more urgent,” a senior administration tells Inside the Ring. Highlighting the growing dangers, Army Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, canceled a scheduled appearance before Congress this week because of the heightened tensions. According to the official, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi renewed a commitment to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Trump also emphasized that the United States will not accept a de facto nuclear state in North Korea. The president also pointedly told Mr. Xi that he is prepared to resolve the North Korean threat — unilaterally if need be. “We did talk about the fact the U.S. will be increasing pressure on North Korea — with or without help from other countries,” the official said. The prospect of U.S. military action against North Korea is something Mr. Xi and the Chinese government fear most. The threat of U.S. action was driven home to all the Chinese present at the Mar-a-Lago resort when Mr. Trump ordered a salvo of 59 cruise missiles on a Syrian airfield linked to a chemical weapons attack. The timing of the Syria bombing was a clear signal to China that Mr. Trump, unlike his predecessor, is prepared to use American military power despite campaigning on “America First” policies. Analysts say averting U.S. military action in Asia is among the highest priorities of China’s leadership. Beijing’s main strategic objective toward the United States is constraining what it regards as the declining U.S. superpower that it believes poses a danger to China. RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION ON SYRIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK The White House this week disclosed new details from U.S. electronic and imagery intelligence on the chemical weapons attack that triggered last week’s cruise missile strike against Syria. According to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the chemical attack that killed scores of civilians, Russian government disinformation operations were carried out in a bid to deflect criticism of the Syrian government of its ally, President Bashar Assad. The information warfare operations sought to blame the attacks on actors other than the Syrian military. The disinformation also falsely asserted that chemical agents other than sarin nerve gas were used. Syria was supposed to have given up all its chemical weapons as part of a Russian-brokered disarmament deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin chimed in on the information operation on Wednesday, asserting U.S. intelligence had fabricated evidence on the Syrian chemical attack. President Trump said in a Fox Business Network interview the same day that Russia was supporting “an evil person” in Syria’s Mr. Assad and called Moscow’s backing “very bad for Russia.” “I think it’s clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there,” one official said. “The cover-up is the disinformation that has happened from the day of the attack to today,” the official added. The declassified intelligence report concluded: “The Syrian regime and its primary backer, Russia, have sought to confuse the world community about who is responsible for using chemical weapons against the Syrian people in this and earlier attacks.” Moscow initially dismissed reports of the chemical weapons at Khan Shaykhun as a “prank of a provocative nature” and asserted evidence, including videos, had been fabricated. However, the intelligence evidence showed Syrian rebels could not have fabricated the amount and quantity of videos and other reporting of the grisly deaths from the attack site. Moscow then shifted its disinformation theme to a claim that the chemical attack was caused by a Syrian bomb hit on a terrorist ammunition depot containing chemical weapons on the outskirts of the town. However, while the Islamic State has used chemical weapons in the past, the group does not possess sarin — the nerve agent used in the Khan Shaykhun attack. Also, a video obtained by U.S. intelligence shows the chemical strike involved at least one chemical weapons bomb that hit in the middle of a street in the northern section of Khan Shaykhun. The bomb crater caused by the chemical blast was not the same as a crater that would have been caused by a conventional high-explosive payload. Syria had been linked to three chemical weapons attacks in 2016 that were launched from a different airfield from the one bombed by Navy Tomahawk missiles. “Russia’s allegations fit with a pattern of deflecting blame from the regime and attempting to undermine the credibility of its opponents,” the report said. LASER INCIDENT 20 YEARS LATER A major theme of Democratic talking points in Congress and on liberal media outlets in recent weeks has been the notion that Russia stole the presidential election from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton through cyberattacks and influence ploys. The anti-Russia political narrative that has ensued is in stark contrast to past efforts by Democrats to support Moscow under successive leaders, including current President Vladimir Putin, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A case in point is the cover-up by the Clinton administration of a laser attack against a Navy intelligence officer in the Pacific Northwest 20 years ago. The April 4, 1997, incident took place in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, north of Puget Sound, when someone aboard a Russian merchant ship that was engaged in intelligence-gathering fired a laser at a Canadian helicopter surveilling the ship. At the time, the ship was sailing inbound through waters used by Navy ballistic missile submarines. In fact, a Navy sub was outbound on the surface in the strait as the Russian ship was transiting inbound. As the Canadian helicopter made a pass over the Russian ship, someone fired a laser that injured the eyes of Navy Lt. Jack Daly, an intelligence officer who was photographing the ship, and his Canadian Sea King helicopter pilot Capt. Pat Barnes. The incident was kept secret by the Clinton administration Pentagon and State Department in a bid to protect its conciliatory policies toward Moscow. The attack would be disclosed in a top-secret Joint Staff report and published in The Washington Times by this columnist weeks later. After a decision was made to search the ship for a laser, the State Department notified the Russian Embassy that the search would take place. The tipoff allowed the Russians to hide or ditch the laser weapon used in the attack. A Pentagon spokesman at the time also provided false information to reporters by stating that there was no evidence the Russian vessel had been engaged in intelligence-gathering. Lt. Daly, who has since retired, told Inside the Ring that the federal government and Navy have never acknowledged the laser attack. “All I have to show for my efforts 20 years later are two eyeballs with 24/7/365 pain and a denial of any VA compensation,” Lt. Daly said. “It’s painfully clear that both Bill and Hillary Clinton have had no problem throwing a military member under the bus without blinking an eye. Their disdain for anyone in uniform is well known,” he added. Lt. Daly said the attack was “just one of many national security cover-ups by the Clintons.” “Thank God our military men and women this day have a commander in chief named Donald J. Trump,” he said. “The alternative was unthinkable.” • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Stratcom issues guidance on drone threats
.B
The commander of the Strategic Command voiced concerns this week that terrorists could use drone aircraft to attack U.S. nuclear facilities. Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, Stratcom chief, told a Senate hearing that he recently issued new policy guidance on how security personnel at nuclear bases should respond to unauthorized intrusions by remotely piloted drones. Gen. Hyten said recent incidents of unauthorized intrusions by drones at Navy and Air Force facilities were “incidental” overflights and not deliberate surveillance or other nefarious activity. “But the fact that they’re occurring, and then if you watch what is happening overseas in the [Central Command area of responsibility] with the use of lethal [unmanned aerial vehicles], and the use of UAVs for surveillance on the part of a terrorist adversary, I’m very concerned that those same kinds of UAVs could be employed against our weapon storage facilities, especially the nuclear weapon storage facilities,” the general said. Last week, Gen. Hyten signed new guidance to nuclear forces on how to respond to “a threat UAV or a surveillance UAV.” The classified guidance is designed to instruct security forces, such as Marines guarding the Kings Bay, Georgia, nuclear missile submarine base or airmen protecting the F.E. Warren Air Force Base missile facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming, on how to respond to drone intrusions, Gen. Hyten said. The guidance is designed to provide a legal and policy framework as well as rules of engagement. Inside the Ring reported March 8 that in response unauthorized intrusions by aerial drones at Navy and Air Force nuclear bases, both services plan to deploy defenses to detect, track and shoot down drones. Another option under consideration is the use of birds of prey — eagles and hawks — to take out small drones that intrude over sensitive facilities. Electronic devices that disrupt drone control signals also are being considered. Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell, a Stratcom spokesman, declined to provide details on anti-drone defenses. “Protecting our force remains a top priority,” Col. O’Donnell said. “That is why Gen. Hyten issued very specific but classified guidance to his force on how to counter the unmanned aircraft threat to the security of facilities, assets and personnel under U.S. Strategic Command.” CHINA’S NUKE BUILDUP QUESTIONED As Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with President Trump in Florida this week, the commander of the Strategic Command is warning that China’s nuclear buildup is raising questions about Beijing’s declared policy of not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. “Although China still professes a ‘No First-Use’ doctrine, it is re-engineering its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple nuclear warheads,” Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten said in prepared Senate testimony made public Tuesday. China also is continuing to develop and test its hypersonic-glide vehicle capability, a weapon that has undermined U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy. Gen. Hyten indirectly criticized the Obama administration policy of reducing U.S. military reliance on nuclear weapons, noting the policy spurred both China and Russia to increase reliance on nuclear weapons and to aggressively modernize and expand their arsenals. “Our adversaries have taken the exact opposite view of our de-emphasis and have emphasized those nuclear capabilities once again,” he said. A major worry is China’s development of ultra-high-speed hypersonic maneuvering strike vehicles. The weapons are launched atop ballistic missiles and then accelerate to speeds of more than 7,000 miles per hour. The high speeds make them difficult to detect and stop since they can outfly most anti-missile interceptors. Hypersonic missiles are “very significant in terms of our ability to see them and provide warning,” he said. “We need to figure out how to do [that] with those.” The general sounded the alarm about the aging U.S. nuclear arsenal and delivery systems that need to be upgraded to maintain deterrence against the new and growing Russian and Chinese nuclear missiles, submarines and bombers. “I’m asking for help on modernizing our entire forces and making sure we have the force structure that is needed to make sure we can deter, not only today, but into the future,” he said. RUBIO ON RUSSIAN CYBER FIRM Sen. Marco Rubio questioned key cybersecurity officials, including the former director of the National Security Agency, about the use of Russian security software that has been linked to the Russian security services. The Florida Republican disclosed during a recent hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that members of his presidential primary campaign last year had been targeted in cyberattacks from unidentified hackers in Russia. Computers used by Rubio aides were attacked by Russian hackers beginning in July in an unsuccessful attempt to gain access to internal campaign documents. The senator then announced to the committee that on March 29 another unsuccessful Russian cyberattack was carried out against his former presidential campaign members. Mr. Rubio then asked three cybersecurity experts testifying before the committee if they would use cybersecurity software produced by the Russia-based company known as Kaspersky Lab, and if they would recommend that senators use the company’s products. “There have been open-source reports which I can cite from that basically say the Kaspersky Lab has a long history connecting them to the KGB successor, the Russian security services,” Mr. Rubio said. Would the experts use Kaspersky Lab security products and should senators use the Russian software? the senator asked. “I’ll answer by no, I wouldn’t,” said retired Gen. Keith Alexander, former director of the NSA, “and I wouldn’t recommend that you do it either. There are better capabilities here that you can use.” Gen. Alexander said other U.S. security firms are more capable of dealing with cyberthreats and would be better at blocking those threats than Kaspersky. Kevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye was more circumspect. “I think the way I’d address that is generally people’s products are better based on where they’re most located and what attacks they defend against,” Mr. Mandia said. “My answer indirectly would be there would be better software probably available to you than Kaspersky to defend you here,” he added. Thomas Rid, professor of security studies at King’s College, London, said he had no qualms about using Kaspersky products but recommended using competing security software in addition. “A bit of a redundancy never harms, but it’s important to say that Kaspersky is not an arm of the Russian government,” Mr. Rid said. Mr. Rid said he believes Kaspersky does not pose cybersecurity threats because it has publicized information about Russian cyberintrusion campaigns and digital espionage operations. “Name any American company that publishes information about American digital espionage,” he said. U.S. security and intelligence agencies have warned against using Kaspersky software for government computers and networks. In particular, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency warned in March 2016 that the Russian company was planning to sell security software to American companies in charge of critical infrastructure that the intelligence service warned could be used by the Kremlin to gain access to industrial control systems. The DIA warned that use of the security software would weaken security for U.S. industrial control systems and so-called supervisory control and data acquisition software, or SCADA systems. Kaspersky Lab has denied that use of its security products would weaken infrastructure control cybersecurity: “The alleged claims are meritless as Kaspersky Lab’s products and solutions are designed to protect against cybercriminals and malicious threat actors, not enable attacks against any organization or entity,” the company said in a statement. “We are not developing any offensive techniques and have never helped, or will help, any government in the world in their offensive efforts in cyberspace,” the company added. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Pentagon tightens security on China contacts
.B
Concerned over illicit Chinese acquisition of defense technology, the Pentagon has taken steps to tighten restrictions on employees who travel to China. Security officials also are urging Defense Department travelers to avoid transit through the communist state after several incidents involving Americans who were detained or harassed on the way to third countries. The changes to the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for prior approval of all contacts with Chinese involving technology. The new rules also limit travel by Pentagon workers to or through China. “Consistent with current practice and the standing guidance referenced above, all DoD entities and individuals engaged in science and technology (S&T) exchanges involving travel to China or prearranged technical or social contact with citizens of China at other venues are required to submit a Defense Contact Proposal (DCP) in advance that will be further coordinated by the Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) Directorate for International Armaments Cooperation in addition to the existing approval process,” the notice states. During the 1990s, Beijing obtained valuable nuclear weapons data during an Energy Department exchange program. Chinese weapons technicians were able to elicit the data during meetings with U.S. scientists and weapons makers. The new review requirements augment existing controls on contacts with Chinese, including a classified directive known as DoD Instruction C-2000.23 and an annual memorandum on guidance for military-to-military exchanges with China. The new rules direct Pentagon officials not to use flights that transit China if they are traveling to other countries. “DoD travelers should NOT transit China en route to a third country whenever possible,” the notice states. “[Defense Attache Office] Beijing strongly recommends not attempting to transit Beijing while on LEAVE or OFFICIAL Travel unless a visa has been obtained prior to travel.” The notice said Pentagon officials traveling through China without a visa have been detained and harassed during the transits. A Pentagon spokeswoman did not return emails seeking comment. EUCOM on Russia threat Russia is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to undermine the West, the commander of the European Command told Congress on Tuesday. “If you look at their forces, from what we know as hybrid or asymmetric means to conventional to nuclear, [the Russians] are modernizing this force in every one of those categories,” Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti told the House Armed Services Committee. The hybrid warfare category includes the extensive use of cyber attacks, along with disinformation and what Moscow calls “information confrontation,” the Eucom commander said. “In recent months they announced new elements within their force that focus on information confrontation, information operations,” he testified. The operations are conducted below the threshold of traditional military conflict, employing such tactics as political provocation, information operations, disinformation and cyber attacks. The use of these new warfare methods is now part of Russia’s doctrine. Conventional force improvements by the Russian military includes upgrading warships and warplanes, along with new weapons for the future. Older aircraft also have been refitted to use newer munitions that can be fired from land-based, aerial and naval platforms. “So it’s a multi-functional system,” Gen. Scaparrotti said. “It gives them long reach and precision.” Nuclear weapons and delivery systems also are being modernized. “Across all the areas,” the general said, the Russians “have been increasing their capability, really refining their capability from the old systems,” adding that more weapons are dual-capable nuclear and conventionally armed. The dual capability “makes it difficult for us to clearly understand what they’ve employed,” he said. As for nuclear use doctrine, Moscow also has adopted a new policy that will permit escalating the use of nuclear weapons more easily during conventional conflicts. “They’ve made the statement openly that they see a use for nuclear tactical capabilities within what we would consider a conventional conflict, which is very alarming,” Gen. Scaparrotti said. In prepared remarks, Gen. Scaparrotti said Moscow is attempting to reemerge as a global power and regards the international order based on rule of law, democracy and human rights as part of a system aimed at suppressing Russia. The Russians under President Vladimir Putin are working to undermine the international system and discredit those in the West who set it up and maintain it. To remedy U.S. military shortfalls in the face of a renewed Russian threat, Gen. Scaparrotti said his forces need more anti-submarine warfare weapons, missiles defenses, and intelligence and surveillance assets. Chinese maritime forces in PLA role China’s fleet of maritime militia forces that have been involved in incidents and skirmishes in the South China Sea act as surrogates for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), according to a report from the Naval War College. “Despite being a separate component of China’s People’s Armed Forces (PAF), the militia are organized and commanded directly by the PLA’s local military commands,” the report by the college’s China Maritime Studies Institute says. The militia are part of the world’s largest fishing fleet with thousands of vessels, a portion of which operates as a separate non-PLA force. Those units serve as “helpers of the PLA,” the report said, providing a “service on demand” when the Chinese military wants to harass U.S. naval surveillance ships. Some of these ostensibly civilian fishing vessels have taken part in the harassment of Navy ships in the South China Sea and other military operations. In 2009 the Navy ocean surveillance vessel USNS Impeccable was threatened by Chinese maritime militia ships, including two that came within 50 feet of the ship. “The degree to which the PLA was involved in harassment of the USNS Impeccable is still unclear; at least one PLA vessel was on the scene,” the report said. However, the fact that the fishing vessels involved were part of the maritime military “would necessitate PLA awareness” of the operation, the report said. China’s military-guided maritime militia operations in several other cases, including the 1974 seizure of the Western Paracels from Vietnam; reconnaissance and sovereignty patrols during the February 2014 blockade of Second Thomas Shoal; and the 2014 repulsion of Vietnamese vessels from disputed waters surrounding a mobile Chinese oil platform. The maritime militia also take part in intelligence gathering and surveillance for the PLA using China’s indigenous Beidou satellite navigation system. The system employs transmission capability of 120 Chinese characters per message. The report said the capability allows “conveying significant content thanks to Chinese characters’ unique logographic nature.” The report was written by war college academics Conor M. Kennedy and Andrew S. Erickson. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Trump critic Patrick Cronin to head plum Pentagon think tank
.B
Patrick Cronin, an Asian security expert with the Democrat-leaning Center for New American Security, has been named to the plum post of director of a key Pentagon think tank, the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies. The appointment was announced March 10 in a notice from the center that said Mr. Cronin was approved by Defense Secretary James Mattis. While Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said Mr. Mattis “was not involved in this decision” that was made before President Trump took office in January, the selection has set off criticism among conservative China analysts who are concerned about Mr. Cronin’s views and writings on China. However, the key eyebrow-raiser for critics was Mr. Cronin’s signing of an anti- Trump protest letter last year. The liberal was among 122 Republican national security officials who signed an open letter in March against then-candidate Trump. “We are united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency,” the signatories stated. “Recognizing as we do, the conditions in American politics that have contributed to his popularity, we nonetheless are obligated to state our core objections clearly.” The letter opposed Mr. Trump for what the signers said were “swings from isolationism to military adventurism” and for aggressively waging trade wars. “He is fundamentally dishonest,” the letter said, adding that the former officials are committed to “working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office.” Mr. Trump announced during the campaign that the critics who signed the two letters opposing his presidential candidacy were part of the “failed establishment” and would not be appointed to positions in his administration. Other Trump critics have failed to make it past White House political vetting that blocked several proposed candidates over their opposition to the president. They include Elliot Abrams, a veteran Republican national security official who was in line to be deputy secretary of state. Asked about his opposition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Cronin said in an email that he will report to the undersecretary of defense for policy as well as the Asia team in the Pentagon and at Pacific Command. “The campaign is history and now the hard work of governing beckons for all Americans,” he said. “After Donald Trump’s triumphant election, I turned to the mission of how I could help the president and his national security team,” Mr. Cronin said. “Attack me for expressing my personal views about candidates during our democratic election process, but please judge me by my faithful and unstinting commitment to support President Trump, his administration, and above all the United States of America.” A Pacific Command  spokesman said the Honolulu-based center is no longer part of Pacific Command. The center is directly under the Pentagon. NORTH KOREA TERROR TRAINING CAMPS A U.S. intelligence report declassified several years ago outlines the North Korean communist government’s support for terrorists and foreign agents, as well as cooperation with Cuban military instructors at camps around the capital of Pyongyang. The report, once labeled “secret,” was produced in November 1983 by the CIA’s National Photographic Interpretation Center. It was based on satellite imagery analysis of six camps spread out in an area about 12 to 20 miles from Pyongyang. According to the report, the camps are similar to two terrorist training camps in Cuba at Guanabo and San Antonio that the report describes as “confirmed terrorist-related training facilities.” Also, intelligence “indicated that Cuban instructors have been sent to North Korea for training, suggesting at least mutual cooperation and may account for the physical similarities in these training facilities,” the report said. “People from at least 30 countries have received training in North Korea,” the report says. “This schooling has included political indoctrination and surveillance, sabotage and assassination training.” A total of 10 facilities were identified as being used by the North Koreans to train foreign agents and terrorists. “North Korea’s nuclear threat rightly gets the most attention,” Mark Sauter, a former Army officer and specialist in North Korea who uncovered the document. “But Pyongyang also poses a very real terrorism threat, and, according to declassified U.S. intelligence documents, has considered using its agents to attack targets in the United States such as nuclear power plants.” The key training center for foreign terrorists was identified by intelligence analysts at Wonhung Ni. “The Wonhung Ni complex near Pyongyang was specifically mentioned as a training facility for foreign nationals as well as for North Koreans,” the report said, adding that along with an administration building, 13 quarters and a gymnasium were identified. North Korea was placed on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1988 after the regime was linked to the bombing of a South Korean airliner in 1987. It was removed from the list in 2008 by President George W. Bush as part of failed diplomatic efforts to negotiate the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. North Korea’s role in the Feb. 13 assassination in Malaysia of Kim Jong-nam, estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, has led to discussion of adding Pyongyang back on the official list of state sponsors of terrorism. South Korea’s intelligence service has concluded that the assassination was directed by the North Korean Ministry of State Security. Two women have been arrested for the Kim murder, which authorities in Kuala Lumpur said involved the use of the deadly nerve agent VX. DUNFORD ON STRATEGIC THREATS Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined in testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday the five major strategic threats facing the United States as Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Islamic extremism. Gen. Dunford said Russia over the past several years has been building up a full range of capabilities aimed at preventing the United States from projecting power and meeting alliance commitments. “These include long-range conventional strike, cyber, space, electronic warfare and undersea capabilities,” he said, adding that Moscow also is modernizing all elements of its nuclear forces. The four-star general testified before the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee on the Trump administration’s budget request for $639 billion. Like Russia, China is undergoing an expansion of its strategic and conventional military capabilities. “They have expanded their nuclear enterprise and made investments in power projection, space, cyber and ballistic missiles,” Gen. Dunford said of the Chinese. “China is also investing heavily in fifth-generation fighters, air-to-air missiles and air defense systems to limit our ability to project power in the Pacific, operate freely and meet our alliance commitments.” North Korea is building missiles and nuclear warheads to be able to attack the United States, and over the past year conducted 38 missile tests, an increase of 81 percent from the previous year. The North Koreans also are conducting cyberattacks against governments and the private sector. Iran remains a support of international terrorist groups and is working to destabilize neighboring countries while using its naval forces to threaten freedom of navigation, the general said. On the struggle with terrorism, the Islamic State and al Qaeda remain the main threats. Gen. Dunford said the military needs a balance of forces that can conduct counterterrorism operations around the world while being ready to deter and fight nation-states. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Iran behind Yemeni rebels’ explosive boats
.B
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels working to take power in Yemen are using a new weapon that is raising fears of seaborne attacks on both military and commercial shipping in the region. The weapon is an Iranian-designed remotely piloted small boat filled with explosives, a defense official told Inside the Ring. The exact number of the explosive drone boats is not known, but the rebels are believed to have enough to threaten ships that pass through the strategic sea lanes off the Yemeni coast. The Navy has intelligence photos of the deadly boats but declined a request to release them. The boats were first detected after one was used in an attack Jan. 30 on a Saudi frigate in the Red Sea. Iran is backing Houthi rebels as part of a strategy of seeking to encircle its rival, Saudi Arabia, and ultimately to take control of the peninsula. One strategic objective of the Iranians is to control the strategic Bab el-Mandeb or Mandeb Strait on the southern Red Sea that is a major shipping passage. Iran already has a major influence in Iraq and in the past has threatened to shut down shipping in the Persian Gulf by targeting traffic passing through the Hormuz Strait. Should the Mandeb Strait come under Iranian control, Tehran would be able to threaten or close shipping at both strategic choke-points that see the passage of a major percentage of the world’s oil supplies. The commander of the Navy’s Fifth Fleet warned about the drone explosive boats after the attack on the Saudi warship. “Our assessment is that it was an unmanned, remote-controlled boat of some kind,” Vice Adm. Kevin Donegan, commander of the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet and head of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, told Defense News Feb. 19. Adm. Donegan did not say the Iranians were behind the drone explosive boats, but the defense official said U.S. intelligence believes the Iranians designed the boat bombs and supplied the materials to build and control them to the Houthis. “That’s not an easy thing to develop. There have been many terrorist groups that have tried to develop that; it’s not something that was just invented by the Houthis,” Adm. Donegan said. “There’s clearly support there coming from others, so that’s problematic.” Adm. Donegan said the deployment of the remote-controlled vessels means that suicide bombers are not needed for attacks. “There are certain terrorists that do things, and they get martyrs to go and do it,” he said. “But there are many others that don’t want to martyr themselves in making attacks like that, and that’s pretty much where the Houthis are. So it makes that kind of weaponry, which would normally take someone suicidal to use, now able to be used by someone who’s not going to martyr themselves.” Adm. Donegan said the United Nations has reported extensively on Iranian military and weapons support to the Houthis. Additionally, the Iranians are supplying the Houthis with ballistic missiles of increasing range. Of the drone boats, Adm. Donegan said: “My fear is they move to use that [weapon] against any kind of commerce that flows through [the southern Red Sea]. And even if they don’t intend to, my fear is that it becomes a collateral damage, because they’re not so good at identifying targets and things like that. “With about 64 vessels a day traveling through there, the Bab al-Mandeb, almost all with energy cargoes, any issue of misidentification or misapplication of one of these weapon systems could become an issue with commerce, and that’s what we have to avoid. In the end, what we’d like to see is that conflict back into the land mass and not out into where we have commercial traffic,” he said. Control over the Bab al-Mandeb could be used to threaten the fragile Egyptian economy by attacking shipping up the Red Sea, he added. Also, any restriction in shipping through the strait would undermine both the regional and global economy, Adm. Donegan said, adding that his biggest worry is that “nation-state-like weapons” are in the hands of non-nation states. China’s Africa Base China is also establishing a military base near the strategic Red Sea chokepoint of the Bab al-Mandeb near the Horn of Africa at Djibouti. The Chinese base is located very close to Camp Lemonnier, a key U.S. military base for operations in both North Africa and the Middle East. The Chinese presence is raising concerns about military spying. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander of the Africa Command, told a Senate hearing last week the Chinese plan to use Djibouti to support Beijing’s global economic strategy known as Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, dubbed One Belt, One Road. “The intention for that location was to provide a port for their ships to have in the area,” Gen. Waldhauser told the Senate Armed Services Committee March 9. “They have about 2,200 peacekeepers on the continent.” Gen. Waldhauser said the Chinese base is due to be completed this summer, and his main concern is the spy threat. Camp Lemonnier is 4 miles from the Chinese base. The camp is used by commandos from the Special Operations Command that often engage in covert missions. The camp is also used by conventional U.S. forces from Africa Command, Central Command and European Command. “The concern that I have from an operational perspective is the operational security when we operate so close to a Chinese base,” Gen. Waldhauser said. “It’s a very strategic location.” The four-star commander said he has voiced his concerns to Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh on two occasions about “what the Chinese can or cannot do at that location.” China’s commercial strategy starts in China and stretches through Indonesia, Malacca to Djibouti, up into Europe and back involving about 60 nations and 40 percent of China’s global domestic product. “It’s all about trade,” Gen. Waldhauser said. “This is their first endeavor in an overseas base, and it won’t be their last.” Russian drones, troops to Egypt U.S. intelligence agencies recently detected Russian military activities in western Egypt, including the deployment of drone aircraft and troops, according to defense officials. The Russian deployment is the latest sign that the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is shifting toward Moscow after decades of relying on U.S. military support. During the Obama administration the delivery of U.S. military helicopters to Egypt needed for counterterrorism operations in the Sinai was held up for months. President Obama backed the Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted in a coup in 2013 by then-Gen. el-Sissi. Defense officials said the Russian activities are being closely watched and appear to be part of Russian support for Libyan military leader Gen. Khalifa Haftar, whose forces represent one faction in the ongoing Libyan civil war. Reuters reported Tuesday that drones and Russian special forces troops had been deployed to western Libya at a base called Sidi Barrani, located about 60 miles from the Egypt-Libya border. The Russian Defense Ministry later denied deploying special forces to Egypt, but did not address whether troops and drones were dispatched. The U.S. military has dispatched special operations commandos to Libya, and also has conducted drone strikes in the country in a bid to knock out Islamic State terrorists who have moved into the largely ungoverned, oil-rich North African state. Army Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of the U.S. Central Command, said recently that the Russian military inroads with one of the United States’ close allies in the Middle East is troubling. “Certainly we have seen outreach to Russia lately,” Gen. Votel said Nov. 1. “I think that is cause for some concern for us [and] I don’t know if that is particularly helpful to the things we are trying to accomplish in the region.” Gen. Votel told a Senate hearing last week that Moscow is seeking to increase its influence in the region. “We’ve seen them do things certainly with our longstanding partner, Egypt and others across — across the region,” Gen. Votel said. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Drones threatened nuclear facilities
.B
Drone aircraft recently carried out unauthorized intrusions over Air Force and Navy nuclear facilities, and the incidents pose a growing threat, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command disclosed to Congress Wednesday. Gen. John E. Hyten revealed the drone threats in written testimony before the House Armed Services Committee for a hearing on nuclear deterrence. “Of recent concern have been the unauthorized flights of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) over Navy and Air Force installations,” Gen. Hyten said. “These intrusions represent a growing threat to the safety and security of nuclear weapons and personnel.” PHOTOS: Must see military movies Currently, the Navy and Air Force are planning to deploy counter-unmanned aerial system defenses that Gen. Hyten said will “effectively detect, track and, if necessary, engage small UAS vehicles.” The commander said protecting U.S. nuclear forces and facilities is a top priority. “We are continually assessing threats to ensure our security apparatus is capable of denying unauthorized access or use of nuclear weapons,” he said. QUIZ: How well do you know your guns? No other details were disclosed about the location of the incidents, or how many took place. Current Air Force and Navy nuclear facilities include Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana; Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri; Bremerton Naval Submarine Base, Washington state; Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, Georgia; Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana; Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota; and F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming. The bases are home to U.S. land-based missiles, bombers and nuclear missile submarines. There have been no news reports of drones making flights over nuclear facilities. Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work warned during a visit to the Kings Bay naval base in April that small drones could penetrate security at nuclear missile and submarine bases. He mentioned that a Netherlands company, Guard From Above, uses birds to attack drones that fly near nuclear power plants, Defense News reported. The Air Force Global Strike Command, which handles security at nuclear sites, is purchasing electronic equipment capable of disrupting the signals that control drones. The most recent National Defense Authorization Act, signed in December, contains a provision that calls on the Energy Department to protect nuclear sites from threats posed by unmanned aircraft. The Energy Department operates 10 nuclear sites in the United States. Drones were detected flying over the Savannah River Site nuclear arms complex last year, and FBI agents questioned an anti-nuclear activist about the flights, the Columbia, South Carolina, newspaper The State reported. The Navy in February 2016 investigated a drone that was spotted flying over Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, where U.S. nuclear missile submarines are deployed. Gen. Hyten and other senior military leaders in charge of nuclear weapons warned during the hearing that any delays in carrying out an urgently needed nuclear weapons modernization program would increase the risk of undermining that U.S. deterrence of nuclear adversaries. “Nuclear modernization can no longer be deferred,” said Gen. Hyten. “Any disruption of the current program of record for future acquisition plans will introduce the risk — significant risk to our deterrent.” The military is building new missiles, missile submarines and bombers to replace currently aging systems. U.S. nuclear cuts during the Obama administration were not matched by China and Russia, and both countries are rapidly modernizing their nuclear forces, the military leaders testified. Navy Chief warns on info security Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson earlier this month issued a memorandum to all senior officers and civilians to be on guard against giving out too much information about the service’s war fighting capabilities. “I need your help to ensure we are not giving away our competitive edge by sharing too much information publicly,” the four-star admiral stated in the March 1 memo. Citing the need to assure allies and deter adversaries, Adm. Richardson said that when it comes to making public communications about Navy operational capabilities, “less is more.” “Sharing information about future operations and capabilities, even at the unclassified level, makes it easier for potential adversaries to gain an advantage,” he said. “Make no mistake, our adversaries are looking for any possible edge,” he said. “Let’s not make their task any easier.” The concerns expressed by the CNO are raising questions among security analysts about why the U.S. military is continuing to engage in potentially damaging military exchanges with China. During the Obama administration, Chinese military officers were feted on scores of visits to advanced military facilities and systems. And ships of the People’s Liberation Army Navy were allowed to take part in the large-scale Rim of the Pacific international military exercises — and then proceeded to send intelligence-gathering ships to spy on the maneuvers. So far under the Trump administration, few military exchanges with China have been carried out. CNO spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Chris Servello said Adm. Richardson was not referring to Chinese military visits or participation in RIMPAC in the memo. “His focus and intention is just on public communications,” he said, adding that concerns over Chinese military information gathering from exchanges “may be looked at in the future.” “Those types of conversations are ongoing between the Navy here in D.C. and at” the Pacific Command, Cmdr. Servello said. “Given this new competitive environment, we’re going to look at all the things we do.” Critics of decadeslong programs of military exchanges with China have said the interactions do little to build trust between the Communist Party-ruled Chinese military and the U.S. military. Additionally, China has gained valuable war fighting information from the program. China poem: Busy Hating A protest poem has gone viral on social media in China. The poem employs what has become a common feature of many online Chinese for dealing with a repressive communist government: wry humor. In this case, the poet was making fun of official government propaganda excoriating Beijing’s foreign enemies. The poem surfaced as officially sanctioned protests broke out in many cities in China to criticize South Korea’s deployment of the U.S. Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile defense system. The poem was translated by China Change, an unofficial website that monitors popular culture. It reads: In the morning I hate America At lunchtime I hate Korea In the evening, I hate the Japanese I have to squeeze in hate for Singapore and the Taiwanese Then at night when I dream I hate on Vietnam and the Philippines On Monday I oppose Korea On Tuesday, Japan On Wednesday, it’s the Americans On Thursday I oppose the independence of Taiwan Friday, that of Hong Kong Come Saturday, against independence in Tibet is what I am On the Sabbath, it’s that of Uighurs in Xinjiang My life is so wonderful and rich Of everything else, I have no time to think or bitch. — Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

U.S.-Russia helmet video gap?
.B
Russia is using GoPro video on the helmets of its fighter pilots, while the U.S. Navy and Air Force do not routinely use helmet cameras that are needed to record the increasing number of dangerous aerial encounters. The Navy delayed for two years before meeting a Pacific Fleet admiral’s request to outfit pilots with helmet-mounted video cameras. The Navy also has not released any video showing some of the recent threatening encounters with Chinese aircraft since the cameras were introduced last year. The helmet video cameras were requested by Adm. Harry Harris when he was Pacific Fleet commander in 2014, amid concerns that U.S. pilots flying over international waters were unable to record dangerous encounters with Chinese jets that routinely attempt to intimidate U.S. surveillance and other aircraft flying over the East China and South China seas. Adm. Harris is commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. Despite the request, it took the Navy two years to approve the request and begin using the cameras. Navy Capt. Charlie Brown, Pacific Fleet public affairs spokesman, said Adm. Harris directed his staff in 2014 to look into equipping maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft with the ability to record video of aerial encounters. Sean Stackley, then the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, “validated in early 2015 the urgent operational need for that capability, and the first systems were fielded in 2016,” Capt. Brown told Inside the Ring. Chinese jets during that period have conducted dangerous aerial intercepts of U.S. aircraft, including an August 2014 incident in which a Chinese J-11 jet did a barrel roll maneuver over the top of a P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft. A year later, a Chinese jet made a dangerous pass near an RC-135 reconnaissance jet flying over the Yellow Sea near Japan’s Senkaku islands. A more recent incident took place in May when two Chinese jets flew close to a U.S. reconnaissance jet over the South China Sea. Lt. Seth Clarke, a Navy spokesman, said some aircraft and helmets have integrated cameras. “We do not currently fly with externally mounted ‘off the shelf,’ i.e. GoPro cameras,” he said. “Equipment like that requires specific flight clearances.” Air Force spokesman Mark Graff said the service does not use helmet-mounted video cameras in fighter aircraft during operations or training. “Some of the helmets have helmet-mounted sights for the head-up display — which have a recording capability — but they are not used for the purpose of monitoring any type of activity,” he said. This issue was highlighted by a recent video released by the Russian Defense Ministry showing that a pilot who flight-tested a new Su-35 jet was equipped with a helmet mount from what analysts say appears to be for a GoPro video camera. CONGRESS SEEKS ACTION ON INF TREATY BREACH House and Senate Republicans have introduced legislation designed to force the Trump administration into counteracting Russia’s violation of a nuclear missile treaty. The INF Preservation Act was introduced in the House by Rep. Mike Rogers, Alabama Republican and chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on strategic forces. “The Obama administration’s failure to confront Russian aggression in practically every sphere has only emboldened Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Rogers said. “His belligerence has brought us to the point that one of the seminal achievements of the nuclear age, President Reagan’s Treaty on Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF), has been left in shreds across Moscow,” he added. “This legislation will give President Trump the tools he needs to show our friends and adversaries alike that ‘peace through strength’ is back.” U.S. intelligence agencies recently reported that Russia has moved from testing to deployment of a new ground-based cruise missile, the SSC-8, that violates the range limits of the treaty. The INF treaty bans missiles with ranges of 310 to 3,420 miles. The bill would declare Russia in material breach of the accord and provide funding for weapons systems including similar “counterforce” missiles, active defenses against intermediate-range missiles and other strike capabilities to negate the advantage of the new Russian missiles. The legislation also seeks to mandate a program to build dual-capable nuclear and conventional road mobile missiles with INF ranges; new missile defense systems; transfer of INF missiles to U.S. allies; and limiting funds for any extension of the 2010 New START arms treaty with Russia until Moscow returns to INF compliance. “If Russia is going to test and deploy intermediate-range cruise missiles, then logic dictates that we respond,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican and one of the Senate sponsors of the bill. CHINA STRATEGY ON CYBERWARFARE PUBLISHED China’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday released a strategy report revealing that China’s military is gearing up for cyberwarfare. The strategy published in Chinese state media asserts that China seeks international cooperation in cyberspace and calls for the United Nations to play a greater role in controlling the internet. The Chinese strategy restates past propaganda themes on cyberspace, such as calling for the notion of the “peaceful settlement of disputes” in the digital arena and not using threats of force. For the Chinese, “state sovereignty” appears to be the basis for all efforts by Beijing to maintain peace and security in cyberspace and for its military cyber buildup. “The tendency of militarization and deterrence buildup in cyberspace is not conducive to international security and strategic mutual trust,” the strategy report says. While urging the peaceful settlement of disputes, the strategy also notes that consultation mechanisms are needed to “forestall and avoid conflict, so that cyberspace will not become a new battlefield.” “Enhanced defense capability in cyberspace is an important part of China’s endeavor to modernize its national defense and armed forces, which complies with the strategic guideline of active defense,” the strategy says. “China will give play to the important role of the military in safeguarding the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests in cyberspace.” The report adds that China “will expedite the development of a cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crises, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability.” The Chinese military has created a branch of the armed services called the Strategic Support Force that will include cyberwarfare capabilities. On U.N. controls, the strategy calls for cyberspace to be “governed by rules and norms of behavior.” “China supports formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behavior in cyberspace within the framework of the United Nations, which will establish basic principles for states and other actors to regulate their behavior and intensify cooperation in order to uphold security, stability and prosperity in cyberspace,” the strategy states. The strategy makes no mention of Chinese cyberwarfare activities and cyberespionage operations and repeats the false statement that Beijing opposes “all forms of hacking and regards them illegal criminal activities.” China also has used technology to censor and control internet activities in China and frequently arrests and imprisons those who run afoul of Beijing’s dictates. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Pentagon studies ways to counter hypersonic missile threat from China, Russia
.B
The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency has launched a study of innovative ways to counter advanced missile threats such as ultra-high-speed maneuvering hypersonic missiles. “MDA understands the emerging threat posed by hypersonic glide vehicle and maneuvering ballistic missile warheads and is evaluating programs and technologies to address this threat,” MDA spokesman Chris Johnson told Inside the Ring. The agency recently released a request for information that will seek to identify weapon concepts for defense against future advanced threats such as hypersonics, he said. The responses are due Friday and will be used to develop an “analysis of alternatives” planned for 2017. Hypersonic missiles are under rapid development in China and Russia as a way to penetrate advanced air and missile defenses such as those developed by the Army and Navy. A major problem for current U.S. missile defenses is that all were designed from the ground up to target missiles with predictable and unchanging trajectories. China’s DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle has been tested at least seven times, and Russia’s Yu-71 hypersonic strike weapon also has been tested several times. The gliders are launched atop ballistic missiles and travel along the edge of the atmosphere at speeds from Mach 5 to Mach 10 — 3,800 to 7,600 miles per hour. The maneuvering strike vehicles can defeat all current U.S. missile defenses, including ground-based interceptors in California and Alaska, sea-based Aegis anti-missile systems and the land-based Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. Congress has been pushing the Pentagon to deal with the threat. The most recent defense authorization bill signed into law in December requires the Pentagon to create a dedicated office for emerging hypersonic missile threats. The MDA disclosed the advanced missile threat study in a brief federal notice published last month. A recent study by a panel of Air Force experts warned last fall that the U.S. is falling behind in the hypersonic missile race. “The People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation are already flight-testing high-speed maneuvering weapons (HSMWs) that may endanger both forward-deployed U.S. forces and even the continental United States,” the study said. “These weapons appear to operate in regimes of speed and altitude, with maneuverability that could frustrate existing missile defense constructs and weapon capabilities.” The study concluded that there was “no formal strategic operational concept or organizational sense of urgency” regarding the threat. It also faulted what it called the Pentagon’s “lack of leadership” in developing countermeasures and defense solutions. MALAYSIANS TRY TO IDENTIFY TOXIN IN NORTH KOREAN HIT Authorities in Malaysia are trying to identify the poison used in the apparent assassination of the estranged brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam, Mr. Kim’s half brother, was killed Feb. 13 in Kuala Lumpur International Airport by a woman who approached him and put some type of substance on his face. The incident was captured on airport surveillance video. Kim died on the way to a hospital after complaining that something had affected his vision. Four people, including a North Korean, were arrested, and police have identified four other North Koreans who left the country shortly after the attack. Kim Jong-nam, who had been living in Macao under Chinese government protection for the past five years, was regarded as a potential threat to the rule of the North Korean dictator, according to Asia analysts. Kim Jong-un has purged several hundred officials since taking power in late 2011. Among those killed: his uncle, Jang Sang-taek, who was regarded as too close to China by the leader. Noor Hisham Abdullah, Malaysia’s director general of health, told reporters Tuesday that poison has not been ruled out in the attack. However, initial analysis could not identify a toxin. “We have to confirm with the lab report before we can make any conclusive remark,” he said, adding that additional forensic analysis is underway. On Wednesday, Malaysia’s chief of police, Khalid Abu Bakar, said two North Korean suspects in the attack worked within the North Korean Embassy in Malaysia. A third suspect worked for the North Korea’s state airline. Mr. Bakar also said security surrounding Kim’s body was increased after an attempted break-in at the hospital mortuary this week. North Korea has demanded a return of the body without an autopsy. If investigators link North Korea to the killing, it could lead to once again placing Pyongyang on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea was placed on the terrorism list for its intelligence operations in conducting deadly bombings and killings abroad. The country was removed from the list in 2008 by President George W. Bush as part of the failed effort to negotiate an end to North Korea’s nuclear programs. PACOM COMPLAINS OF LEGAL RESTRAINTS Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the Pacific Command, complained this week that the military is facing too many legal constraints in efforts to develop high-technology forces and capabilities. Speaking at a conference in San Diego on Tuesday, Adm. Harris urged abandoning “linear thinking” on weapons and war fighting in favor of building deadlier, more revolutionary types of arms. “Engineers and acquisitions types will hear this message and think, ‘The PACOM commander is tired of the same old stuff. He’s demanding innovative weapon systems with more lethality.’ You’d be right,” he said. The four-star admiral wants the military to build weapons that will produce exponential leaps in firepower, using cutting-edge technology such as drones and artificial intelligence. New concepts will include what Adm. Harris called the “Ghost Fleet” of unmanned and autonomous systems on land, in the air and under water working together with older weapons. The admiral added that some of the major obstacles to retooling arms and war fighting concepts are self-imposed. “In the vernacular, we need to stop shooting ourselves in the foot,” he said. For example, “unnecessary restrictions” currently are imposed on cyberwarfare capabilities and the authorities needed to use them. “You’ve all seen the headlines, ‘Cyber capabilities exceed authorities.’ I read that to mean that ‘we can’t use the tools we’ve developed.’ And I’m sure some of the developers of these tools are wondering why they even bother to continue their innovative work if we can’t use it,” he said. Another significant restriction has been imposed on developing weapons needed to counter growing cruise and ballistic missile threats in Asia, from both North Korea and China. “China is free to field a complete arsenal of highly capable advanced land-based anti-ship missiles while we’re restricted from fielding the kinds of conventional weapons we must have to stay ahead of them,” said Adm. Harris, noting Russia’s recent deployment of an illegal cruise missile in violation of a 1987 nuclear treaty. He called for applying innovative thinking on how to deploy forces while adhering to international treaties. “Or, if we’re not going to get exponentially smart, let’s at least get better lawyers,” he said. Adm. Harris said as a military commander he seeks to bring a gun to a knife fight. But he warned that current restrictions mean that “I might get shot before I even get to the fight.” “I can’t ask you to build something that we can’t use,” he said. “But we can’t leave game-changing technology on the shelf because of restrictions on sensible security measures.” • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Michael Flynn and the revenge of the bureaucrats
.B
The resignation of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on Monday was the result of a coordinated effort by current and former U.S. intelligence officials to undermine the Trump administration using the disclosure of highly classified communications intercepts. President Trump voiced his displeasure in a tweet Wednesday stating that misuse of the intercepts was un-American. “The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” the president stated. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former Defense Intelligence Agency director, was let go after admitting he did not fully explain to Vice President Mike Pence and other officials the content of telephone conversations he had with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak late last year when Mr. Trump was president-elect. According to a White House national security official, the intelligence bureaucrats went after Mr. Flynn not because of his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The real concern was his plan to reform U.S. intelligence agencies that during the Obama administration became mired in political correctness and lost much of their effectiveness, the official said. The anti-Flynn campaign was launched prior to Inauguration Day and targeted not just the national security adviser but also at least one of his aides. The National Security Council’s staff specialist for Africa, retired Marine intelligence officer Robin Townely, had his request for “top secret, sensitive compartmented information” clearance rejected by the CIA. Under current rules, the NSC can issue top-secret clearances. But the higher SCI-level clearance must be approved by the CIA. The White House official said the denial was unjust and an indirect political attack on Mr. Flynn. Yet it was just such SCI-level information that was shared with reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post and other news outlets in disclosing details of Mr. Flynn’s pre-inauguration phone calls to Mr. Kislyak. Chris Farrell, a former counterintelligence official and director of investigations and research at Judicial Watch, called the disclosures “reckless endangerment of national intelligence sources and methods to advance a political smear job.” Mr. Flynn is a critic of U.S. intelligence agencies and was planning to oversee a major overhaul of the spy agencies — something that upset entrenched intelligence officials concerned about protecting bureaucratic rice bowls. In 2010, then-Gen. Flynn co-authored a landmark report, “Fixing Intel,” calling for sweeping reforms after criticizing intelligence as misaligned with the objectives in the Afghanistan War. “Eight years into the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy, Having focused the overwhelming majority of its collection efforts and analytical brainpower on insurgent groups, the vast intelligence apparatus is unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which U.S. and allied forces operate and the people they seek to persuade,” the report said. HASC CHAIRMAN ON RUSSIAN TREATY VIOLATION The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee is criticizing the Obama administration for failing to confront Russia’s violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. U.S. intelligence agencies recently discovered that a Russian cruise missile being developed in contravention of the treaty has now been deployed. The missile was identified as the SSC-8 cruise missile. The New York Times first reported the land-based cruise missile deployment on Tuesday. “These reports, if true, are disturbing but not surprising,” said committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, Texas Republican. “Congress repeatedly urged, and even required in law, the Obama administration to confront Russia on violations of the INF Treaty. The Obama administration did very little.” As a result, the only arms control treaty to eliminate an entire class of missiles — those with ranges of 310 to 3,420 miles — lies “in tatters,” he said. “Our military has warned publicly that such a violation poses a military risk to the United States, our allies and our deployed forces,” Mr. Thornberry said. “There are clearly lessons here for the Trump administration about the price of not confronting aggression, which puts international security at risk.” Russia’s INF violation was known since 2012 but kept secret by the Obama administration to avoid upsetting arms control talks with Moscow. FBI ON ROMANCE SCAMS Just in time for Valentine’s Day, the FBI this week released a report warning that unscrupulous con artists are engaged in internet romance scams. In one case, a Texas woman in her 50s fell in love with a man she was chatting with online, only to end up being fleeced for $2 million. The FBI says this type of online romance crime is on the rise and its victims are typically older, widowed or divorced women who are targeted by criminal groups, usually from Nigeria. Targeting online victims “is like throwing a fishing line,” said FBI Special Agent Christine Beining, a financial fraud investigator in Houston. “The perpetrators will reach out to a lot of people on various networking sites to find somebody who may be a good target,” she said. “Then they use what the victims have on their profile pages and try to work those relationships and see which ones develop.” The woman in Texas who lost $2 million was targeted by her posts on Facebook that indicated she had a strong Christian faith. The con artist, identified only as “Charlie,” used the information to court her. The scammer masqueraded as an average person, proposed marriage and eventually asked for money. The FBI says romance scams accounted for the highest amount of financial losses to victims of all online crimes. Last year, nearly 15,000 complaints were logged as romance scams or confidence fraud, with losses exceeding $230 million. Much of the fraud occurred in California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. Advice from the FBI: Never send money to anyone you haven’t met. “If you don’t know them, don’t send money,” Ms. Beining said. “You will see what their true intentions are after that.” • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Sanctions highlight China-Iran missile connection
.B
The Trump administration recently imposed sanctions on Iran for its missile test, and the sanctions reveal that Tehran’s missile program is backed by covert assistance from China. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. sanctions, said last week that a “Chinese-based network” was helping procure goods for Iran’s ballistic missile program. The sanctions designated 13 people and 12 companies who were placed under the Treasury restrictions that prohibit any U.S. companies from doing financial transactions with them. The action followed a flight test Jan. 29 of an Iranian medium-range missile that failed a short time after launch. The sanctions were unusual for identifying two Chinese nationals, Xianhua Jack Qin and Yaodong Richard Yue. Also named was Carol Zhou, also believed to be part of the Chinese procurement network but whose nationality was not disclosed by Treasury. Additionally, two Chinese companies were targeted: Ningbo New Century Import and Export Co. Ltd, based in the eastern port city of Ningbo and managed by Mr. Qin; and Cosailing Business Trading Co. Ltd. based in Qingdao. Mr. Yue told the Reuters news service that he is with Cosailing and had his bank account frozen. “I export to lots of countries, and Iran is a customer too. That’s totally normal,” Mr. Yue said. Cosailing trades in a variety of products including industrial machinery and furnaces. An internet search indicates Mr. Qin is Ningbo’s manager and that it manufactures commutators for electric motors and electrical tools, as well as vehicle parts. China’s backing of Iran’s missile program was detailed in leaked State Department cables made public on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. The cables reveal that Chinese firms have provided a range of missile-related goods including specialty steel, accelerometers, ball bearings and gyroscopes. Iran’s Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group has acquired Chinese-made graphite cylinders, tungsten powder and tungsten copper-alloy ingots. The group is in charge of Iran’s solid-propellant ballistic missile program. A report on Iran’s ballistic missile program from 2008 states that Tehran was developing several medium-range ballistic missiles, including the deployed Shahab-3 with a range of 800 miles; an improved Shahab-3 with a range of 1,242 miles; and the Ghadr-1 with a range of 1,100 miles. Another medium-range missile is the Seijil, with a range of 1,200 miles. A 2009 State Department cable said: “Chinese firms over the past year have offered or sold [Missile Technology Control Regime]-controlled and non-annex items to ballistic missile-related entities in foreign countries, including Iran, Pakistan, and Syria. In some cases, sales have continued despite extensive information provided by the U.S. to Chinese authorities outlining our concerns about these firms’ activities.” The transfers have violated U.S. nonproliferation laws, the U.S. government says. “Iran’s continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, to our partners worldwide, and to the United States,” acting OFAC Director John E. Smith said in a statement Jan. 3. The sanctions are aimed at countering “Iranian malign activities,” he added. “We will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior,” he said. TRUMP’S POLITICAL INFO WAR Since becoming taking office Jan. 20, President Trump has waged a relentless information war against his political enemies, using Twitter attacks and public speeches to take on opponents in the news media, Congress, the courts and elsewhere. As result, the president has come under unprecedented media counterattack. A review of recent network news broadcasts and newspapers reveals major outlets are devoting large blocks of time and ink to criticizing Mr. Trump, mainly through political counterattacks on Trump nominees and executive orders, and especially the travel restrictions imposed on immigration from seven Muslim-majority states. Mr. Trump’s charges of 3 million illegal votes also has been targeted. The battles are part of an escalating digital and information conflict playing out in Washington and on social media. The heavy political and media criticism would have crushed lesser political leaders, but apparently not Mr. Trump, who appears to relish the combat. “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!” the president said Monday in a tweet characterizing his defiant stance. Mr. Trump has proved to be a master of Twitter more than other media, something he showed during the election campaign. Using the 140-character microblog, Mr. Trump belittled, insulted and ultimately vanquished a large field of Republican primary rivals. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was tagged “low energy.” Sen. Marco Rubio became “Little Marco.” Sen. Ted Cruz was labeled “Lyin’ Ted.” For the general election, Mr. Trump gained traction with “Crooked Hillary” that became a rallying cry against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose campaign was overshadowed by FBI investigations of her improper use of an unsecure email server. Democratic obstructionism against nominees, including Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, prompted the president to say Jan. 31, “When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn’t work!” The travel restrictions led Mr. Trump to take on the Washington state judge who blocked the ban, labeling him a “so-called judge” who is undermining American security by ordering a temporary halt to the ban. Prior to inauguration, Mr. Trump also challenged U.S. intelligence assessments of Russian hacking and influence operations but toned down his criticism after receiving classified briefings. On the foreign policy and national security front, Mr. Trump has launched a barrage of tweets outlining his priorities, including building up American nuclear forces and increased cybersecurity. Iran has been a major target along with radical Islamic terrorism, a distinct shift from the Obama administration’s refusal to identify terrorists as driven by Islam. Mr. Trump has yet to respond directly to comments he made Sunday to Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly about Vladimir Putin. Mr. O’Reilly asked why the president appears to be supporting Mr. Putin, whom the Fox host described as a “killer,” an apparent reference to his assassination of political opponents. Mr. Trump responded by comparing the Russian leader to U.S. leaders. “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent? You think our country’s so innocent?” he said. Mr. O’Reilly then said he is unaware of any U.S. government leaders who are killers. “Well, take a look at what we’ve done too,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve made a lot of mistakes. I’ve been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.” Mr. O’Reilly: “Yes. Mistakes are different than “ “A lot of mistakes, OK, but a lot of people were killed. So a lot of killers around, believe me,” Mr. Trump said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted that “I don’t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy — yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!” OUTGOING MDA DIRECTOR STILL IN PLACE The director of the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency has managed to hang on to the job for five months despite a successor being named and confirmed by the Senate. The long delay has led some defense officials to wonder whether Vice Adm. James D. Syring is reluctant to give up the post of MDA director he has held since November 2012. The office is responsible for the Pentagon’s annual multibillion-dollar program of developing weapons and systems to defense military forces around the world. His replacement, Air Force Lt. Gen. Samuel A. Greaves, was nominated in September and confirmed by the full Senate that month but has yet to make the shift from the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles. MDA spokesman Chris Johnson said the delay in change of command is because of selecting replacements but added that the handover won’t take place anytime soon. “The department is currently coordinating the transition schedule,” Mr. Johnson told Inside the Ring. “There can sometimes be a delay between the selection of a replacement and the transition for senior military positions due to the need to select replacements for positions further down the chain of command. We expect the MDA transition to occur by this summer.” • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Al Qaeda resurgence
.B
U.S. intelligence agencies recently uncovered new information indicating the al Qaeda terrorist group continues to plan for conducting terrorist attacks around the world. Until recently al Qaeda has been overshadowed by its more violent offshoot, the Islamic State, in conducting and inspiring deadly terrorist strikes around the world. However, new intelligence obtained over the past several months revealed that al Qaeda had stepped up terror planning using the chaos of Syria as a new base of operations. Al Qaeda operatives from the Persian Gulf States, Pakistan and elsewhere were detected in Syria. The al Qaeda terrorists are embedded with the Syrian terrorist group Al Nusrah Front but are operating independently. “They’re using Syria as a safe haven and a place to conduct foreign operations,” said a military official familiar with intelligence reports. The intelligence triggered major U.S. bombing raids against the group. One of the most significant took place Jan. 19, when a long-range B-52 bomber and several armed drones carried out a bombing raid in western Syria. The bomber and drones struck an al Qaeda training camp with 14 bombs, killing more than 100 terrorists. The “Shaykh Sulayman Training Camp” had been in operation at least since 2013. “The removal of this training camp disrupts training operations and discourages hard-line Islamist and Syrian opposition groups from joining or cooperating with al Qaeda on the battlefield,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, adding that since Jan. 1 more than 150 al Qaeda terrorists have been killed. “These strikes, conducted in quick succession, degrade al Qaeda’s capabilities, weaken their resolve and cause confusion in their ranks,” Capt. Davis added. “We will continue to exert unrelenting pressure to defeat violent extremist groups across the globe.” The al Qaeda targeting continued with the attack by Navy special operations forces in Yemen Jan. 28. The raid was successful in capturing a significant amount of electronic devices, officials said. But there were indications the security of the mission was compromised after the U.S. commandos, along with troops from the United Arab Emirates, came under fire shortly after arriving. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William “Ryan” Owens was killed and several others were wounded. President Trump traveled to Dover Air Force Base Wednesday afternoon for a private ceremony welcoming the body home. U.S. urged to revamp nuclear doctrine The Obama administration nuclear doctrine must be upgraded to reflect the growing nuclear weapons dangers posed by Russia and China, according to a former Pentagon nuclear arms expert. Keith Payne, co-founder of the National Institute for Public Policy, a Virginia think tank, argued in a recent speech that the assumptions contained in the Pentagon’s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review — that nuclear war had receded as the result of friendly foreign relations — is wrong. “The world has become a much more dangerous place since the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), and Western security policies and practices need to adjust to this new reality,” Mr. Payne said during a conference on strategic weapons in the 21st century Jan. 26. The 2010 nuclear review was based on Mr. Obama’s announced goal of creating a world without nuclear weapons. The review stated that “the international security environment has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War” and noted that “the threat of global nuclear war has become remote.” The review became the basis for U.S. nuclear deterrence and was never revised after Russia re-emerged as a major nuclear threat. Since 2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have issued stark threats to conduct nuclear attacks against the United States and the NATO alliance. Mr. Payne said that, until recently, the notion of an increasing threat of nuclear conflict would have been deemed farfetched since the post-Cold War world was supposedly moving beyond such fears. Now the Pentagon is scrambling to bolster an aging nuclear arsenal to maintain nuclear deterrence against both Moscow and Beijing. “We are now playing catch-up as nuclear deterrence once again is identified as priority No. 1 by senior U.S. civilian and military leaders,” Mr. Payne said, noting a Pentagon report last year as stating America’s “nuclear deterrent is the [Defense Department’s] highest priority mission.” Mr. Payne said the utopian push for a new world order was “mugged by reality,” notably efforts by the governments of Russia and China to overturn the existing global dynamic and expand their nuclear arsenals. “Russia’s explicit nuclear-first use threats and reported planning for first-use employment reflect a partial failure of Western deterrence strategies, and the mounting palpable fears of some U.S. allies reflect a partial failure of assurance,” Mr. Payne said. “This is not speculation about some dark future; these partial failures are here and now.” Russia is building several new land-based and submarine-launched nuclear missiles along with nuclear submarines, including a drone submarine armed with a megaton-size nuclear warhead capable of destroying entire seaports. To counter Russian nuclear threats, Mr. Payne is urging the West to counter the threats with tougher strategic messaging to indicate that the United States and NATO are prepared to stand up to Moscow “even under the threat of nuclear war.” A more assertive nuclear declaratory policy is needed, he said. “The historical evidence is overwhelming that uncertainty and ambiguity sometimes are not adequate to deter; explicit and direct threats are necessary in some cases. The Putin regime may be such a case,” Mr. Payne said. Coming sectarian conflict in Iraq A former Army Ranger and combat veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan recently spent a month in the Middle East and tells Inside the Ring that Iran has effectively taken over most of neighboring Iraq. The former military expert, a longtime operative and analyst in the region who spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns because he continues to work in the region, also said that Iraqis are braced for a new round of sectarian war between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in the country. “The Middle East and the Persian Gulf region in particular have been lost to Iranian dominance,” the analyst said. “Iranians rule Iraq,” the analyst said. “Shia militias have more power than the government. Baghdad looks like little Tehran. Lots of Iranian flags, Hezbollah flags. Farsi graffiti is present everywhere.” The major military campaign to retake the northern city of Mosul from Islamic State has energized well-armed Shiite militias that are preparing to ramp up sectarian violence once the Mosul campaign is completed. “From north to south and from the highest levels of government [and] military to the lowest level of population, I did not meet anyone that isn’t preparing for sectarian war post the Mosul offensive,” the analyst said. The Shiite militias’ stronghold is Anbar Province, and their objective is to eliminate or displace the Sunni population and create a Shia autonomous regional zone like the Kurdish Regional Government has carved out in northern Iraq. The Iraqi government in Baghdad has no control over the militias that are supported by Iran with weapons, training and advisers. The Iranian domination of Iraq should raise questions about the future of the high-end U.S. military weapons systems and technology that are being supplied to the Iraqi government. “Iranians and Iranian-allied elements have access to all of it,” the military analyst said, noting that some Shiite militias are equipped with U.S.-made M-1 Abrams tanks. The impending unraveling of Iraq would be a major setback for the United States, which has invested billions of dollars and thousands of lives in the country. In northern Iraq the Kurds remain divided, with the Kurdish Democratic Party aligned with Turkey and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan allied with Iran. The Obama administration’s conciliatory policies toward Tehran contributed to the Iranian takeover and left the new Trump administration few options to counter it, the analyst said. After Iran’s latest ballistic missile test last week, Trump National Security Adviser Mike Flynn said Wednesday the White House was putting Iran “on notice” that such moves would not be tolerated as they were under Mr. Obama. “The Trump administration must work with regional allies in the Gulf as well as with disparate groups in Kurdistan, northern Syria and amongst the disaffected Sunni tribal population to begin the long process of unwinding Iranian dominance in the region,” he told Inside the Ring. — Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

North Korea sends spies overseas to prevent defections, extend reach of human rights abuses
.B
North Korea has deployed more than 300 undercover security officers around the world to spy on government personnel and laborers to prevent them from defecting, according to information provided by a former North Korean security official. The overseas operatives are engaged in human rights abuses related to their monitoring of activities of North Korean diplomats, government officials and the tens of thousands of laborers who are sent abroad to raise cash for the communist regime of Kim Jong-un. The North Korean defector disclosed the activities of the Ministry of State Security, the totalitarian state’s spy and security arm, last month, according to an official familiar with the defector’s testimony. The defector revealed that MSS operatives are engaged in human rights abuses such as extorting money from overseas North Koreans, kidnappings, beatings and torture. In one case, a North Korean student in France identified only as “Han” attempted to defect in November 2014 after his family was purged by the Kim regime. Before he could defect, the student was abducted by MSS agents and was about to be forcibly sent back to North Korea when he managed to escape. Another case in Europe two years ago involved MSS agents who tried to forcibly repatriate the child of a North Korean diplomat. That bid also failed. Many other North Koreans, however, have been sent to die in prison labor camps. Most of the MSS agents abroad operate under diplomatic cover in embassies and U.N. posts. About 100 MSS agents are devoted to monitoring the more than 50,000 North Koreans working overseas, mainly in construction sites in China, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. The export of workers has increased under the Kim regime in a bid to gain hard currency. The number of MSS agents posted overseas also has increased in recent years as more North Koreans have begun defecting. North Koreans working abroad were subjected to extortion of their wages, beatings, forced repatriation and punishment for contacts with foreigners. A North Korean construction worker in Qatar told the South Korean newspaper Dong A Ilbo last month that workers are starved while being forced to engage in labor-intensive construction work for three-year stints. The MSS also routinely extorts a major portion of North Korean workers’ paychecks, which can range from $150 per month to $1,000. Workers’ death benefits also are extorted by the agents. Details about the rights abuses by MSS agents come after the U.S. government this month imposed more sanctions on Pyongyang for human rights abuses. The Treasury Department slapped sanctions on seven North Koreans and two agencies Jan. 11, including MSS Director Kim Won-hong. “The MSS engages in torture and inhumane treatment of detainees during interrogation and in the country’s network of political prison camps,” the Treasury Department stated in announcing the sanctions. “This inhumane treatment includes beatings, forced starvation, sexual assault, forced abortions, and infanticide,” the department added, noting that Mr. Kim directs the rights abuses of the MSS. The action coincided with the release of a State Department report on human rights that identified North Korea as among the world’s most egregious violators of human rights. The State Department also said North Korea “continues to commit extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced labor, and torture.” “The North Korean regime not only engages in severe human rights abuses, but it also implements rigid censorship policies and conceals its inhumane and oppressive behavior,” said John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury’s office of foreign assets control. The sanctions expose “individuals supporting the North Korean regime and underscores the U.S. government’s commitment to promoting accountability for serious human rights abuses and censorship in North Korea.” The unilateral U.S. sanctions so far have not been matched by United Nations sanctions. The U.N. Security Council in November urged member states to reduce North Korean diplomatic staff in their countries, and said Pyongyang should take steps to alleviate human rights abuses. TECH COMPANIES, WASHINGTON SPLIT AMID GROWING CYBERTHREATS Despite growing cyberthreats from China, Russia, North Korea and others, the Obama administration’s policies failed to improve U.S. cybersecurity, according to a report made public Wednesday by the Council on Foreign Relations. “Although the Barack Obama administration signaled early that it intended to make cybersecurity a priority, the strategic situation has not significantly improved despite the White House’s efforts,” according to the report by Adam Segal, the technology and security analyst at the council. The report calls on Silicon Valley to work more closely with the federal government in seeking solutions to cyberattacks. Disclosures by renegade former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden have produced “deep mistrust” between the government and the private sector that must be overcome, the report concludes. Snowden documents revealed that the National Security Agency exploited American companies’ software by inserting malware into products, undermining encryption used by companies and hacking into several companies’ cables carrying data. “All of these actions damaged the reputation of U.S. technology companies with their users and catalyzed foreign governments to exert more control over transnational data flows,” the report said. Bridging the divide between government and Silicon Valley is urgently needed to improve cybersecurity, and is a top priority of the Trump administration. The report also warned that cyberattacks are growing in sophistication and magnitude, costing the U.S. some $500 billion annually. Ransomware attacks jumped to a staggering 4,000 per day in the first quarter of 2016, four times higher than the daily average in 2015. Health care cyberattacks also increased. “Foreign governments have grown increasingly able and willing to use cyberattacks for sabotage, espionage and political influence,” said the report, noting power grid attacks in Ukraine and Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee. China stole more than 20 million personal records from the Office of Personnel Management, while Iran engaged in large-scale denial-of-service cyberattacks and a cyberattack on a water control dam in New York. The North Koreans carried out the Sony Pictures cyberattack in late 2014. The majority of the attacks “do not cross into the territory of an armed attack or the use of force,” the report said. “The nature of the threat, however, will change as the internet of things — robots, cars, medical equipment and other machines that communicate over the internet — introduces new vulnerabilities.” To thwart surveillance, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and other companies have stepped up encryption in products and are challenging the government over court access to customer email and personal data, the report said. The backlash against government surveillance also has led U.S. technology firms to align with anti-intelligence advocates, potentially harming U.S. security efforts. The split between Silicon Valley and Washington imposed “political costs” that have made it difficult for the United States to cooperate with friends and allies on national security, the report said. “The Trump administration faces many challenges: rising cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated and aggressive state-sponsored attackers; a growing divide with the technology community; and the reassertion of national sovereignty in cyberspace,” the report said. “These problems are interconnected and will require sustained focus from policymakers as well as high levels of cooperation with the private sector.” CHINA: HANDLE TRUMP CAREFULLY Internal instructions from China’s government call on all propaganda organs and news outlets in China to deal carefully with President Trump and the new U.S. administration. “For all media, any recent reports about the United States must strictly conform with the central media; any news relating to Chinese-U.S. relations must use Xinhua copy,” states the Jan. 13 government instruction in Chinese leaked to China Digital Times. “Any news about Trump must be handled carefully; unauthorized criticism of Trump’s words or actions is not allowed.” China’s leadership is assessing the new U.S. president, who has issued provocative statements touching on Chinese militarization in the South China Sea, U.S. policy toward Taiwan and plans to take a hard line on unfair Chinese trade practices. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

Donald Trump to reform intelligence
.B
One national security priority of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trumpis to reform the heavily bureaucratized and, to some critics, politicized U.S. intelligence community. Mr. Trump recently clashed with intelligence officials over the disclosure of a false dossier produced by a former British intelligence official that was leaked by someone in the U.S. government in a bid to embarrass the new president. A source close to the Trump transition team said plans to do away with the director of national intelligence are still being considered, despite the announced nomination of former Indiana Republican Sen. Dan Coats to be the new DNI. The reform could include reverting to the old system of having a director of central intelligence as a nominal chief of the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies who also ran the CIA. The new system could include separate DCI and CIA directors. That would leave Mr. Coats as the DCI along with Rep. Mike Pompeo, the director-designate of the CIA. Both are conservatives who favor reforming the current intelligence system. The DNI was set up after the Sept. 11 terror attacks as a way to better coordinate the many separate intelligence agencies. But its functions instead have created new layers of bureaucracy and red tape in an already stifling system. A U.S. intelligence official told Inside the Ring that the pending reforms should include a downsizing of analysts and administrative personnel, especially a large number of lawyers who by training are risk-averse. “The new administration needs to encourage intelligence professionals who have been harmed by the political class to come forward and reveal what has taken place,” the official said. One target of criticism has been outgoing CIA Director John Brennan, a career intelligence analyst who critics say sharply turned the agency in a leftward direction during his tenure in Langley. He reportedly wore a rainbow lanyard while in the office in a show of support for gay-rights advocates at the agency. Organizationally, a CIA source said Mr. Brennan weakened the agency’s storied Directorate of Operations (DO) — the espionage branch — by mixing in political appointees and analysts with operatives trained in the dark arts of intelligence. Under Mr. Brennan, the CIA set up a course for analysts at the agency’s training center, known as “The Farm” near Williamsburg, that allowed the analysts to claim status as trained DO officers even without receiving the full spectrum of clandestine service training. Mr. Brennan criticized Mr. Trump in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week claiming the president-elect crossed a line in criticizing intelligence for what the president-elect said was leaks to the press and a lack of integrity. “I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens,” Mr. Brennan stated. Mr. Trump countered in a Tweet: “Oh really? Couldn’t do much worse — just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?” Earlier Mr. Trump said of the false dossier that U.S. intelligence agencies “should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?” Mr. Brennan denied he disclosed details of a secret briefing where the false dossier was discussed, and appeared to blame the FBI that he said is in charge of investigating links between Russians and U.S. citizens. Mr. Trump’s reference to the buildup of Russian nuclear weapons indicates his administration likely will seek to undo the damage caused by the Obama administration’s 2010 New START nuclear arms pact with Russia. Since New START went into force, President Obama cut the U.S. nuclear arsenal sharply at the same time Russia built up its nuclear warhead stockpile — above the levels of the treaty. Today, the disparity has left the United States with 429 fewer nuclear warheads than Russia, a shortfall that analysts say undermines the strategic balance needed to maintain deterrence. North Korean test U.S. intelligence agencies are bracing for a possible North Korean nuclear or missile test coinciding with the inauguration Friday of President-elect Donald Trump. North Korea has said it is planning to conduct a long-range missile test and intelligence officials have said an underground nuclear test could be carrier out with little or no warning. Intelligence indicators of impending tests have been closely monitored at the underground nuclear test area in the northeastern part of the country. Missile launch areas also are getting close scrutiny. Mr. Trump sought to prevent the rogue state from developing missiles capable of hitting the United States by tweeting of earlier this month that “It won’t happen!,” after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to conduct a test. Mr. Kim said the test would involve a missile that one day will be capable of reaching the U.S. mainland — a key reason for the limited U.S. missile defenses now deployed in California and Alaska. One possibility for Pyongyang, according to a U.S. government official, is a first test of a new, road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile known as the KN-08. Unlike the current long-range missile known as the Taepodong, the KN-08 is easily hidden in caves or shelters and can be hidden from view while preparing for launch. Under President Obama, North Korea has conducted four of its five underground nuclear tests. The administration has done little to discourage Pyongyang from the tests and after each test has sought additional sanctions at the United Nations. Critics say the outgoing administration farmed out its North Korea policy to China, which has done little to dissuade the Northeast Asia communist state, an ally of Beijing, from provocative tests. Mattis on Russia Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis is calling for tough policies to counter the growing threat from Russia, according to his written answers to policy questions posed by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mr. Mattis said Russia has “chosen to be a strategic competitor,” but noted that the United States engaged Moscow during the darkest days of the Cold War. “I support the president-elect’s desire to engage with Russia now,” Mr. Mattis said. “Engagement should serve as a means to achieve national objectives. We must define these objectives and look for areas of potential cooperation with Russia.” However, Mr. Mattis, a former four-star Marine Corps general, also called for pushing back against Russian aggression. “We must confront Russia’s behavior, and defend ourselves if Russia chooses to act contrary to our interests,” he said. “Challenges posed by Russia include alarming messages from Moscow regarding the use of nuclear weapons; treaty violations; the use of hybrid warfare tactics to destabilize other countries; and involvement in hacking and information warfare,” Mr. Mattis added. Strengthening the NATO alliance is a key to meeting the Russia threat along with an integrated strategy of strengthening the alliance, he said. President-elect Donald Trumprecently said part of NATO’s mission are “obsolete,” drawing criticism from some in the foreign policy establishment. Mr. Mattis said: “Buttressing NATO will be fundamental to meeting these challenges, and we will need an integrated strategy that strengthens the North Atlantic alliance and ensures that the Department of Defense is prepared to counter both traditional and emerging threats.” •Contact Bill Gertz and Twitter at @BillGertz.

Intelligence report predicts dire future
.B
Robert M. Gates, a former CIA director, once said that when intelligence analysts smell flowers, they look for a hearse. The latest long-range intelligence forecast by the National Intelligence Council is a case in point. The NIC, an academic and intelligence analysis group, released a report this week on future global trends, and the picture the analysts painted is not bright. “The next five years will see rising tensions within and between countries,” the 235-page report concludes. “Global growth will slow just as increasingly complex global challenges impend. An ever-widening range of states, organizations and empowered individuals will shape geopolitics.” Worse, the analysts predict the post-Cold War era of American world dominance is drawing to a close, along with the rules-based international order in place since the end of World War II. International cooperation will be much harder, and “veto players will threaten to block collaboration at every turn, while information ‘echo chambers’ will reinforce countless competing realities, undermining shared understandings of world events.” The reference to echo chambers is an interesting reference — considering that was a term used by Ben Rhodes, outgoing White House deputy national security adviser. Mr. Rhodes boasted at one time of creating a propaganda echo chamber of think tank experts and pliable journalists during the political campaign to win support for President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. Terrorism also is getting worse: “The threat from terrorism will expand in the coming decades as the growing prominence of small groups and individuals use new technologies, ideas, and relationships to their advantage,” the report said. Russia and China also will remain growing threats aimed at undermining the United States through nontraditional warfare “gray zone aggression” and activities designed to “stay below the threshold of hot war but bring profound risks of miscalculation” — intelligence-speak for triggering a conflict. Globalization has “hollowed out” Western middle classes and prompted a backlash — a not-so-veiled reference to the election of Donald Trump on a populist and economic nationalist platform and Britain’s exit from the European Union. “Migrant flows are greater now than in the past 70 years, raising the specter of drained welfare coffers and increased competition for jobs, and reinforcing nativist, anti-elite impulses,” the report said. Identity politics is increasing populism on both the left and right of the political spectrum along with nationalism. The NIC states that nationalist sentiment and threatening characterizations of the West are being used to “shore up authoritarian control in China and Russia.” The report defines populism as “suspicion and hostility toward elites, mainstream politics and established institutions.” Echoing leftist pundits like The New York Times’ Paul Krugman, the report warns that populist leaders and movements are anti-democratic. “Populist leaders and movements — whether on the right or left — may leverage democratic practices to foster popular support for consolidation of power in a strong executive and the slow, steady erosion of civil society, the rule of law, and norms of tolerance,” the report said. CHINA DENIES MILITARY HACKING The Chinese Defense Ministry has responded to a U.S. Army report disclosed by Inside the Ring last week exposing two Beijing hotels as headquarters for its electronic warfare unit, known as the People’s Liberation Army 4th Department, or 4PLA. The unusual statement issued Jan. 6 and posted on the Defense Ministry website criticized the Army report on the use of the hotels in the Haidian district in Beijing as “the strongholds of its cyber-espionage operations headquarters to scout and collect intelligences.” “[The] relevant accusation is totally groundless and a bad act of smearing China,” the ministry said. The Chinese military “has never supported any hacking activities.” Additionally, the ministry says, the Chinese firmly oppose “relevant criminal activities in accordance with law, including network attacks.” The ministry said the United States “should not make groundless accusations against China.” Instead, the ministry invoked the disclosures by renegade former contractor Edward Snowden revealing the National Security Agency’s Prism program. “The U.S. should give a clear explanation on the Prism Gate incident to China and the international community,” the ministry said. The statement did not directly dispute the Army report’s finding that the two hotels are used by the PLA’s electronic warfare and cyberattack service. The Justice Department indicted five PLA hackers in 2014 on charges of breaking into networks of U.S. corporations and stealing valuable information that was provided to Chinese competitors. U.S. intelligence officials have said the hacking of the Office of Personnel Management and the theft of sensitive files on 22 million federal workers were the work of Chinese military hackers in retaliation for the indictments. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, in response to questions about Russian cyberattacks during the election campaign, cited China’s hacking of the OPM as an example of widespread threats posed by foreign cyberattacks. “Twenty million accounts were hacked in this country by China,” Mr. Trump said at a New York press conference. “And that’s because we have no defense. That’s because we’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing.” Mr. Trump promised to develop stronger cyberdefenses early in his administration. STRATCOM CHIEF ON MISSILE DEFENSE The new commander of the Omaha, Nebraska-based Strategic Command said the military is poised to shoot down any long-range missile fired by North Korea. Interceptors at the missile defense base at Fort Greely, Alaska, are prepared to knock out any long-range missile fired toward the United States, said Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the Stratcom commander. “You have soldiers standing watch in case there is a launch against the United States. We have a defensive system that will shoot it down,” the general said. Fort Greely’s interceptors make up one element of the anti-missile system. “We have a series of sensors, radars at the far end of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, radars in the Pacific, radars in Alaska proper, that are there to sense the capabilities,” Gen. Hyten told Alabama’s WAAY television. “Then we have overhead space assets that are the bell-ringers that see the event when it first happens, cue all of those capabilities, and it’s all integrated together through an integrated command-and-control process to make sure that we’re not surprised, that we can defend the United States against those kinds of adversaries that might want to do us harm with an ICBM. That cannot be allowed to happen.” Gen. Hyten is overseeing a multibillion-dollar modernization of the U.S. nuclear force, including new missiles, submarines and bombers. “If we don’t build those, then we’re in significant problems — not now, but in about a decade from now some really significant risks could start,” he said. The risk is that one element of the U.S. deterrent force could be weakened, undermining the nation’s ability to deter states such as Russia and China. Gen. Hyten said the Stratcom subcomponent, Fort Meade, Maryland-based Cyber Command, eventually will be elevated to a separate combatant command. “Right now, I don’t support separating it from the National Security Agency because the capabilities we use are in many cases in the National Security Agency,” he said. “The separation will come at some time down the road — just not in the near future.” • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz.

PLA’s hacking hotel
.B
U.S. military intelligence has identified a headquarters for a Chinese military hacking unit — inside two Beijing hotels. According to an open-source intelligence report produced by the Army’s Asian Studies Detachment, “the Headquarters/Jintang and Seasons Hotel appear to be located in the same or at least adjacent buildings, both of which are, according to available information, owned by or connected to the People’s Liberation Army 4th Department.” The Fourth Department, known as 4PLA, until recently was part of the military’s General Staff Department and is also known as the Electronic Countermeasures and Radar Department. The unit was reorganized into a new PLA service called the Strategic Support Force. The roll of the department is to conduct offensive electronic warfare and information warfare, including offensive cyberattacks. The electronic and information warfare are among China’s most secret operations, and the location of the headquarters at the hotels appears to be following the strategic dictum of hiding in plain sight. The 4PLA is considered one of China’s most threatening spy agencies because of its mandate for high-technology warfare and intelligence-gathering. Its capabilities extend into space and include disrupting enemy communications, navigation and synthetic aperture radar satellites. “The 4PLA’s cybermission is first and foremost focused on the disruption and denial of enemy computer networks,” according to testimony by John Costello, a former Navy intelligence official, before the congressional U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “The targeting necessary to successfully carry out these missions requires the 4PLA to have a strong network surveillance component,” Mr. Costello added. “This operational targeting in both cyber and electronic domains forms the basis of 4PLA’s role as an intelligence service.” China’s military units have been blamed for the massive hack of 21.5 million records of federal workers from the Office of Personnel Management networks over the last two years. The Justice Department also indicted five PLA hackers in 2014 for cyberattacks against U.S. companies. The OPM hack was strategically significant because it allows China’s intelligence services to conduct more targeted technical and human intelligence operations against American government personnel, especially those with access to secret information and those in charge of managing government computer networks. Chinese military hacking very often involves the use of so-called “spear-phishing” cyberattacks — the use of fraudulent emails to trick unsuspecting computer users into loading malware that allows the penetration of large-scale computer systems. According to the U.S. Army intelligence report, the Fourth Department owns the two hotels in northern Beijing called the Seasons Hotel and Headquarters/Jintang Hotel. The report does not explain why the hotels were used by the Chinese for hacking, although it is likely that it will be used to conduct intelligence gathering. China’s electronic and cyberwarfare intelligence units are considered high-interest targets. The report highlights how internet searches in the digital age often produce valuable intelligence. In the case of the 4PLA headquarters, the Army learned about the connection to the PLA from an online posting from 2012 when a customer stated in a review that the Jintang Hotel was “owned by the PLA General Staff 4th department” and, as a result, was much quieter than other Beijing hotels. Further records’ searches revealed that both hotels are owned by the 4PLA. A company called Beijing Philisense Technology Co., Ltd. stated in a public Chinese documents that the company was leasing the third and fourth floors of the Seasons Hotel from “People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff 4th Department Hotel, No. 2 Zhixincun, Huayuan Road, Haidian, Beijing.” The lease was signed in 2009 and runs through 2023. Another public document stated that the 4PLA has leased the first 12 floors of the adjacent hotel to Philisense Technology from 2012 through 2024. The entire Seasons Hotel is said to be wired for wireless internet access, while the adjacent Jintang/Headquarters Hotel also has wireless connectivity in conference rooms and guest rooms. The report noted that commercial hotel booking websites offer rooms at both hotels. But the Army tried to arrange for a room stay and found doing so was “largely impossible.” Those seeking rooms through online booking sites were met with error messages or notices that the hotel is no longer open. All the hotels were observed to be open as of December 2015, a month before the Army report. Islamic State Targets Indonesia The Islamic State terror group is increasing its activities in Indonesia, a nation with the largest population of Muslims in the world. According to a report by the State Department’s Overseas Security Advisory Council, a public-private partnership, security authorities are detecting more activities by Islamic State. “Recent comments by the Indonesian chief of police indicated that the number of terrorism-related offenses handled by the country’s security personnel in 2016 was more than double that of the previous year,” the report said, noting five terrorist attacks in 2016 with as many as 15 other planned attacks thwarted by counterterrorism operations. “Authorities attribute the rise in terrorist related activity to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant’s (ISIL) efforts to conduct attacks around the world to distract attention from its mounting losses, and suggest that it is likely to persist for the foreseeable future,” the report said. Indonesian National Police Chief Tito Karnavian said last month that 170 suspected terrorists were captured by security personnel in 2016. By contrast, 82 terror suspects were arrested in 2015. “Of the 170 cases, 40 militants were sentenced, six were returned to their families, 36 are facing trial, 55 are being investigated and 33 were killed in clashes with authorities,” the report said. Five terrorists were killed in December during investigations into plots targeting the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Among the Islamic State-related terror attacks in Indonesia, eight people, including four militants, were killed in a January 2016 attack on a shopping area in downtown Jakarta, the capital. It was the first terror attack in Jakarta since 2009. In July, a failed suicide bombing against a police station left a motorcycle-riding terrorist dead but caused no other casualties. All five attacks were linked to the pro-Islamic State group Jemaah Anshorut Daulah, known as JAD, that surfaced in 2015 out of several extremist groups. It is believed to be led by Aman Abdurahman. The increase in terrorism in Indonesia also appears linked to the activities of Syrian-based Indonesian terrorist Bahrun Naim. The report said recent evidence uncovered during counterterrorism investigations indicates the terrorists’ capabilities are evolving toward the use of more lethal explosives for possible use in rice-cooker bombs — like those used in the Boston Marathon bombings. “Despite the continued disruption of extremist plots by Indonesia’s capable counterterrorism authorities, the possibility of isolated extremist attacks is unlikely to disappear anytime soon,” the report said. “This may be particularly true as possible Indonesian foreign fighters find it more difficult to travel to Iraq and Syria and instead are encouraged by Southeast Asian foreign fighters to conduct attacks at home.” The report warned U.S. government and private-sector personnel to use caution while traveling to Indonesia, to avoid demonstrations and to be wary of shopping malls, nightclubs, bars, restaurants and houses of worship. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

Lawmakers urge Pentagon to probe Huawei deal
.B
Three Republican members of Congress are urging Defense Secretary Ash Carter to investigate the security risks to American facilities and military forces in South Korea posed by a Chinese telecommunications company’s role in a new wireless network in the country. “The United States cannot risk having its sensitive or classified information compromised by foreign Chinese spyware that could provide a means for Chinese authorities to access American data,” Rep. Steve Chabot, Sen. Mark Kirk and Sen. John Cornyn stated in the Dec. 22 letter. Mr. Chabot chairs the House Small Business Committee. Mr. Kirk lost his re-election race in Illinois in November, but Mr. Cornyn of Texas is the Senate Republican whip. The concerns are focused on Huawei Technologies, which has been linked to the Chinese military and intelligence services by the U.S. government. According to the lawmakers, South Korea’s government is in “active discussions” with Huawei for a contract to build a nationwide 5G — for fifth generation — wireless network. “Huawei has been under intense scrutiny from the U.S. government given its close ties to the Chinese government,” the lawmakers said, noting a 2012 House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence probe that concluded that “Huawei may have deliberately incorporated vulnerabilities in its equipment that could be exploited by the Chinese military and security services,” according to the letter. Additionally, the federal government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which monitors foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets, was urged by the committee to ban Huawei from government contracts. “The findings of this report have led to a de facto ban on Huawei’s participation in major telecommunications projects in the United States and Australia,” the members said. Huawei’s role in the South Korean network also raises cybersecurity concerns. The network will support “highly sensitive areas” such as U.S. military, intelligence and diplomatic facilities, including an advanced telecommunications network in Jeju-do, an island off the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the congressmen said. The lawmakers warned that allowing Huawei to take part in the network “presents potential security concerns about China’s increasing network penetration across sensitive areas of the East China Sea.” The new 5G network also could give China access to thousands of internet-linked devices called the “Internet of Things” in the region. “As such U.S. military, intelligence, diplomatic or civilian personnel that connect to a Huawei-backed 5G network could have their data compromised,” they stated. The letter also quoted former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden, who warned that Huawei in the past has “shared with the Chinese state intimate and extensive knowledge of foreign telecommunications systems it is involved with.” The congressmen asked Mr. Carter to “investigate the cyber security implications of Huawei’s potential participation in the South Korea’s 5G network” and to raise the security concerns in discussions with South Korean leaders. Huawei spokesman William Plummer said the company is a leading provider of telecommunications infrastructure equipment that is “world-proven and trusted.” Huawei gear is used in over 170 markets, including Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin and North America, he said. “These are demonstrable facts,” he said. “These are not rumors, innuendo, hearsay, or any other type of groundless suggestions that cannot and have never been proven.” New counter-disinformation center The fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill signed into law by President Obama last week contains a provision calling for a new U.S. government program to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. The Global Engagement Center will be located in the State Department and must be established in the next six months. “The purpose of the center shall be to lead, synchronize and coordinate efforts of the federal government to recognize, understand, expose and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests,” the law states. The center will seek to integrate efforts to track and evaluate disinformation, analyze foreign narratives, and disseminate “fact-based” narratives aimed at countering the lies and deception. The center will have an operating budget of up to $60 million for 2017. The legislation also will allow the center to provide funds to civil society groups, media content providers, nongovernmental organizations, federally funded research and development centers, private companies, and academic institutions. The funds will be used to refute disinformation and media manipulation. The center, however, will be temporary and close down on Dec. 23, 2024. The center will replace some functions of the defunct U.S. Information Agency, which was shut down in 1999. Its functions were transferred to the State Department and critics say its effectiveness has been limited by diplomats more concerned with not upsetting U.S. foreign relations than countering foreign lies. The new center was the result of efforts by Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican and Sen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat. “Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies, and so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel,” Mr. Portman said in a statement. “But today, the United States has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive, and destabilizing, foreign propaganda and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas.” The bill follows aggressive Russian influence activities that have included cyberattacks against U.S. political figures and what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was a covert program designed to affect the outcome of the presidential election. Mr. Obama has ordered an intelligence review of the Russian influence operation. The Washington Post reported this week that the president may soon impose sanctions on Russia for the election interference. Europe braced for returning terrorists A State Department security report is warning that large numbers of Europeans who traveled to the Middle East to fight for the Islamic State terror group are set to return to their home countries, posing an increased terrorism threat. “Over the past five years, an unprecedented number of Europeans have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight or train with terrorist groups operating in the conflict zone,” the Dec. 22 report said. “However, since many remain in the theater their eventual return may prolong the heightened risk environment which has come to be known as Western Europe’s ‘new normal.’” A total of 21 of the 50 Islamist attacks in Western Europe since 1994 involved Europeans who received terror training abroad. “The 21 attacks include most of the high-profile, mass-casualty Islamist terrorist attacks that Western Europe has experienced since Islamist terrorism first emerged in the region approximately two decades ago, including the 2004 bombings in Madrid (191 killed); the 2005 bombings in London (52 killed); the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris (12 killed); the November 2015 attacks in Paris (132 killed); and the March 2016 attacks in Brussels (32 killed).” The truck attack in Nice, France in July that killed 86 was carried out by an Islamist with no foreign training or fighting experience. Foreign training “suggests that combat and military training received overseas may increase the lethality of perpetrators,” the report by the Overseas Security Advisory Council said. Syria and Iraq were the main foreign terrorist training grounds with up to 7,000 Europeans traveling there since 2014. The report said European governments are concerned that progress in attacking the Islamic State in its Syrian and Iraqi bases will force more European terrorists back to the continent. Some 2,100 European fighters already have returned home, and to date three attacks were linked to these returning Islamic State terrorists. European authorities have claimed that asylum seekers from the Middle East have not been not used for infiltration by terrorists. But the State Department said “there is evidence that some have, including members of the cell behind the November 13 attacks in Paris.” Asylum seekers in Germany also conducted terrorist attacks, including a July 18 ax attack in Wurzburg, a July 24 suicide bombing in Ansbach, and the December 19 truck ramming of a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin. The danger of attacks in Europe will require increased security vigilance “as the heightened ‘new normal’ risk is expected to persist for the time being,” the report concluded. •Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

U.S. intelligence warned of Christmas-related Islamic State truck attacks
.B
U.S. intelligence agencies issued general warnings around the world that Islamic State terrorists were planning to use trucks in attacks on gatherings of people, according to U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports. Specific warnings were issued to allied intelligence services in Europe and Asia based on information gleaned from the Islamic State, indicating the terrorist group’s sympathizers would conduct attacks using large trucks in Christmas-related killing sprees. That scenario played out Monday in Berlin, where a truck barreled through a crowded market, killing 12 people and injuring 48. The attack is being blamed on a fugitive Tunisian, Anis Amri, a radical with known links to an Islamic terrorism leader, according to German authorities. A U.S. official said the Berlin attack has been linked indirectly to the Islamic State’s entreaties to sympathizers around the world to use trucks in attacks at this time of year. The warning said terrorists would commandeer large, multi-axle trucks and drive them into crowded areas. The Berlin massacre was a copycat of a terrorist attack in Nice, France. The July 14 killings involved a cargo truck driven into a crowd on Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring 434 others. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. The Islamic State is seeking to repeat truck attacks to achieve its goal of seeking a caliphate, a global regime under Islamic rule. The group on Monday declared that the perpetrator of the Berlin attack was a “soldier of the caliphate,” the Islamic State-affiliated Amaq website stated. The truck attacks indicate that the Islamic State continues to move beyond its strongholds in Syria and Iraq and conduct deadly strikes in Europe and elsewhere. Security in the United States is being increased following the Berlin attack. The State Department warned last month that Americans face a heightened risk of attack in Europe during the holiday season. “Terrorist attacks against holiday gatherings (including public Christmas and New Year’s celebrations) have occurred in Europe in the past,” said a State security report. “Jewish interests have also been targeted by Islamist extremists; this year, Hanukkah coincides with Christmas.” WARSHIP RECOVERED DRONE In a clear message to Beijing, the Pentagon this week dispatched a guided missile destroyer to recover an underwater drone snatched by the Chinese navy four days earlier. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Mustin, part of the Pacific Fleet, sailed from a port call at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, to rendezvous with the Chinese in a carefully choreographed handover of the underwater research glider, according to Pentagon officials. During the exchange, sailors aboard the Chinese navy ship tied a rope to the tail of the drone and set it loose in the area of the South China Sea near the Philippines, where it was taken on Dec. 15. A small inflatable boat dispatched from the Mustin sailed to a point midway between the drone and Chinese ship, where one of the sailors grabbed the rope and retrieved the 30-foot research vessel. The underwater glider originally was dispatched by the Navy’s USS Bowditch, an ocean survey ship. No radio communications between the U.S. and Chinese navies took place in the drone recovery. The handover ended the latest incident that has strained U.S.-Chinese relations and highlighted China’s illegal maritime claims over the South China Sea. A senior military officer said the dispatch of the destroyer was deliberate and intended to signal to China that its interference with survey operations was an unacceptable violation of freedom of navigation activities in international waters. China privately has attempted to portray the drone incident as the result of an overzealous naval officer of the South China Sea fleet, a claim met with deep skepticism by the Pentagon and Pacific Command. “We know that no Chinese naval officer would ever conduct something like that without [higher] approval,” a U.S. military officer told Inside the Ring. The vessel that seized the floating drone was a Dalang III-class ship, used in submarine rescues. The drone was identified as an “LBS glider,” or Littoral Battlespace Sensing-Glider, which is capable transmitting ocean data for up to six months. The glider is used in anti-submarine warfare activities as well as anti-mine warfare and special operations missions. The Pentagon issued a relatively mild public rebuke, reflecting conciliatory Obama administration policies toward China. “This incident was inconsistent with both international law and standards of professionalism for conduct between navies at sea,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “The U.S. has addressed those facts with the Chinese through the appropriate diplomatic and military channels, and have called on Chinese authorities to comply with their obligations under international law and to refrain from further efforts to impede lawful U.S. activities.” The Pentagon said it is investigating the incident and insisted that U.S. military forces will “continue to fly, sail, and operate in the South China Sea wherever international law allows, in the same way that we operate everywhere else around the world.” The area where the Navy ocean survey was carried out is a high-interest target for U.S. intelligence agencies that are closely monitoring a covert Chinese military buildup on the islands in the region. Days earlier, newly publicized satellite photographs revealed new Chinese military installations on several reefs, specifically hexagon-shaped naval gun emplacements on several islands and reefs that pose threats to U.S. and allied ships. The Navy has been aware of the short-range naval guns photographed on the Spratly Islands since earlier this year. The guns were spotted on Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs last summer, and recently at smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson and Cuarteron reefs. Each gun emplacement is made up of either large-caliber guns or, on some reefs, a small missile battery along with an adjacent fire control radar. The Pentagon is worried about the gun deployments because of their plug-and-play capabilities. The weapons currently in place have ranges of a mile or two that pose little danger to Navy warships, which have been and will continue to conduct passages near the reefs. However, military intelligence analysts have determined that the guns and missiles can be swapped out for longer-range and more lethal Chinese anti-ship missiles. Adding more deadly anti-ship missiles would provide China with military control over the strategic waterway that China is seeking to gradually take over. The South China Sea military buildup is being carried out gradually by the Chinese to avoid triggering a larger crisis. “It’s like a frog being boiled alive,” the military officer said of the creeping Chinese military buildup. SELF-DESTRUCTING DRONES Military analysts say one option the Pentagon could use to prevent China from more provocative thefts of underwater drones is to outfit the gliders with explosive self-destruct charges. The glider taken last week and returned Monday is under 24-hour remote communication. Adding an explosive charge to its components and announcing that capability would deter thefts. Anyone who improperly tried to steal the drone would be faced with death or injury. The Islamic State terrorist group used a similar tactic in a recent attack in Syria. According to Pentagon officials, Islamic State fighters last summer sent an aerial drone into Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria and made it appear that the drone had landed as a result of a malfunction or loss of remote control. Kurdish militias retrieved the small aircraft and drove it to a nearby base, believing they were about to gain a windfall on Islamic State intelligence-gathering capabilities. But three Kurdish fighters were killed and several others were wounded after taking the drone apart. An investigation revealed that the Islamic State had booby-trapped the drone with a type of improvised explosive device designed to kill leaders or intelligence personnel. The bomb was disguised as a second small battery inside the drone. • Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter via @BillGertz. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

North Korea prepares to conduct new missile test
.B
North Korea is preparing to conduct new missile tests amid heightened tensions in Northeast Asia. U.S. intelligence agencies say Pyongyang will likely conduct a new salvo of missile launches following the latest round of United Nations sanctions against the reclusive communist state. The world organization on Dec. 1 imposed additional sanctions that seek to block North Korea’s revenue obtained from exports by 25 percent. The sanctions bar member-states from purchasing North Korean copper, nickel, silver and zinc exports, and the sale of large statues, a favored purchase for African dictators. The sanctions followed a recent North Korean underground nuclear test. In the past, Pyongyang responded to similar sanctions with provocative missile launches. North Korea’s most recent missile test was a failed launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile called the Musudan in October. The missile has an estimated range of 2,000 miles and its development has set off alarm bells in the Pentagon and in Japan. Officials said the next missile test could be a Musudan launch to counteract the earlier test failure. Military officials said the North Koreans are engaged in an impressive missile development program for systems of varying ranges and launch modes. North Korea has yet to launch one of its new road-mobile KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The new ICBM is deployed on Chinese-made missile launchers that are banned under international sanctions on Pyongyang. North Korea has conducted several tests of a new submarine-launched missile known as the KN-11. The most recent flight test of the missile took place in August. North Korea also has conducted five underground nuclear tests, the most recent one on Sept. 9. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate the North Korean nuclear arsenal includes between 10 and 20 warheads. Chinese military construction China has made major gains in building up its military facilities on newly-created islands in the South China Sea, according to new satellite imagery made public this week. “China appears to have built significant point-defense capabilities, in the form of large anti-aircraft guns and probable close-in weapons systems, at each of its outposts in the Spratly Islands,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported Tuesday. The new facilities have expanded from Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs first spotted in June and July to point-defense fortifications on smaller facilities known as Gaven, Hughes, Johnson and Cuarteron reefs. Satellite imagery posted online by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative shows guns and other weapons systems on several of China’s key islands that the Pentagon has said are part of a covert effort by Beijing to take control of the strategic waterway. Disclosure of new military facilities comes as the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Harry Harris, warned China against further aggressive action in the South China Sea. “We will not allow a shared domain to be closed down unilaterally no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea,” Adm. Harris said Wednesday in a speech in Sydney, Australia. “We will cooperate when we can, but we will be ready to confront when we must.” The comments were the first by the four-star admiral on the maritime dispute since reports surfaced two months ago that he had been muzzled by the White House from making statements critical of China. Adm. Harris said American naval forces would continue to conduct freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea to ensure the strategic waterway remains international waters. Any decision for Australia to conduct similar operations is up to the Australian government, he added. “The U.S. fought its first war following our independence to ensure freedom of navigation,” Adm. Harris said. “This is an enduring principle and one of the reasons our forces stand ready to fight tonight.” China military unrest President-elect Donald Trump’s recent comments about U.S.-China relations are not the only worry facing China’s Communist rulers. Leaders in Beijing are increasingly worried about growing military unrest from tens of thousands of disgruntled former soldiers who can’t find work, according to Pentagon officials. Beijing criticized Mr. Trump for remarks Sunday questioning China’s policy of having sovereignty over Taiwan. The anger in the ranks of ousted People’s Liberation Army soldiers surfaced in a two recent protest demonstrations by tens of thousands of former military personnel who gathered near the Central Military Commission (CMC) headquarters in Beijing in October and November. “There are real security concerns in Beijing about these demobilized soldiers,” said a U.S. intelligence official. “They are kind of being pushed over the edge by the government.” The first protest involved between 20,000 and 30,000 former soldiers on Oct. 11 at the CMC headquarters — the ultimate power center in China whose chairman is President Xi Jinping. The military protesters included older veterans and recently demobilized troops. They came from a dozen cities around the country and were demanding the CMC provide promised pension, medical and social security benefits. A second protest took place Nov. 1 but details of the number of protesters could not be learned. The November protest received far less news coverage as Chinese authorities took steps to prevent reporting, both in China and abroad. The veterans’ anger highlights what U.S. intelligence has estimated is one of China’s most politically dangerous protest movements. The former soldiers have been mistreated by the government and more are being demobilized as part of plans to streamline the Chinese military. The disgruntled soldiers represent a new kind of opposition to the ruling Communist Party and the party-controlled People’s Liberation Army. Chinese internal security troops and police were called out during the protests, and police tried to prevent news reporters from covering the protests. Prior to the November demonstration, barricades were erected near the CMC to keep protesters away from the military headquarters, Radio Free Asia reported from Beijing. “I signed up to the army in 1976 in Beijing, and was demobilized in 1988,” said one veteran who identified himself only as Gao. “It wasn’t too bad to start with, but then they started laying people off in the factories, and we were just given [$58] and told to leave. That was never going to be enough. We have been unfairly treated. I gave my best years to the army, and I have nothing to show for it.” The protesters included both former enlisted soldiers, and officers as well as soldiers who took part in Chinese nuclear tests, and China’s 1979 border war with Vietnam. Chinese internal security forces also have started cracking down on the protesters after they returned to their home districts. Detention facilities have been set up in hotels where former military members are interrogated, beaten and harassed. The protests also have continued on China’s vibrant social media platforms, prompting tighter censorship. The ruling Communist Party leadership regards the military protests as a major threat to stability. “Neither the high-pressure stability maintenance strategy, nor President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign have been able to address the huge inequalities within the system for the distribution of economic benefits,” political analyst Liang Jing Liang stated in a recent commentary for Radio Free Asia. “This will leave more and more people angry and dissatisfied, and eventually all of that dissatisfaction is going to be directed at the government.” ⦁ Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.

At Trump-less correspondents event, focus back on journalism
.B
Will Smith and George Clooney, step aside for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. It’s safe to say that the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner — traditionally the most glittery night on the Washington social calendar, where A-list celebrities sprinkle their stardust as coveted guests of media organizations — will have a different vibe this year. With the current president — highly unpopular in Hollywood — staying away, organizers say the focus will not be on the red carpet but on the bedrock principles of the event: the First Amendment and the crucial role of the press in a democracy. Not that those principles haven’t always been central to the mission of an event that began in 1921, notes Jeff Mason, WHCA president. But, he says, “the focus will be entirely on that this year, and I think that’s a great thing.” The absence of President Donald Trump, who has called the media “fake” and “dishonest” and even “the enemy of the people,” marks the first time a president has declined since Ronald Reagan in 1981 — and he was recovering from an assassination attempt (but phoned in some friendly, humorous remarks nonetheless.) Trump has decided to hold a rally in Pennsylvania instead, and his White House staff will also be absent, in what was described as “solidarity” with their boss. But even if Trump had decided to come, this year’s event would have been different, Mason says, “based on the tension that has existed in the relationship and some of the things he has said about the press. We were preparing for a different dinner either way.” So as opposed to last year, when guests at President Barack Obama’s final dinner included Smith, Emma Watson, Kerry Washington, Helen Mirren, the late Carrie Fisher, and, for a Kardashian quotient, model Kendall Jenner, this year’s big stars seem to be Woodward and Bernstein — not Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, who played the famous reporting duo, but the men themselves, who’ll be presenting journalism awards. Woodward told the Washington Post the two will speak about “the First Amendment and the importance of aggressive but fair reporting.” There will be, as usual, a comedian emceeing the event, which will air on C-SPAN: Hasan Minhaj, of “The Daily Show.” But he will have competition: late-night star Samantha Bee will be headlining “Not the White House Correspondent’s Dinner,” airing at 10 p.m. EDT on TBS (TV stars like Alysia Reiner of “Orange Is The New Black,” Retta of “Parks and Recreation,” and Matt Walsh of “Veep” are among those scheduled to attend the party afterward.) Besides the high-profile after-parties (some of which have been canceled this year), the correspondents’ dinner has spawned a number of annual events the same weekend, like the fundraiser Friday night for The Creative Coalition, an advocacy group fighting for continued arts funding. Tim Daly of “Madam Secretary” (the group’s president), Keegan-Michael Key of “Key & Peele,” Walsh of “Veep,” and many others are scheduled to attend. There’s also a traditional garden brunch co-hosted by media consultant Tammy Haddad — who will be attending the correspondents’ dinner, too, and says she’s looking forward to it. “What you’re going to see Saturday is more journalists per square inch than ever before, united in showing what they do and how they do it,” she says. “Those celebrity spots will now be taken by journalists,” Haddad adds. “There’s going to be more interest in what they do. I mean, look at David Fahrenthold,” she said of the Pulitzer-winning Washington Post reporter, one of the dinner’s award recipients. “He’s the Bono of journalism. Journalists are heroes now.” The dinner didn’t start out as a multi-day celebrity-studded event. Most trace that development to 1987, when then-Baltimore Sun reporter Michael Kelly brought Fawn Hall, the secretary in the center of the Iran-Contra affair. That began a tradition. In 2012, Lindsay Lohan came as the guest of Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, a development that earned scorn from Tom Brokaw. (“Give me a break,” he said in an interview with Politico.) The potentially (to some) uncomfortable glitz factor, not to mention the schmoozing of administration officials and journalists who cover them, led a few news organizations to stop attending in recent years. But other guests have seen it as a good opportunity to get some business done. “There’s always business going down,” says Robin Bronk, CEO of The Creative Coalition. “In Washington, you’d be hard-pressed to find a party that doesn’t have a purpose. It tastes good, but it’s good for you.” Bronk says the WHCA dinner, celeb factor aside, “does a fine job of reminding us why a free press is so important. They always do a great job protecting this great amendment that we have.” Mason, of the WHCA, says Trump may be sending a signal with his absence, but that’s up to him: “The signal that WE are sending is that we will uphold the principles of the First Amendment and we will celebrate that at this dinner.” Still, it won’t be all serious, he says, promising that Minhaj will be using his comedy chops - without “roasting the president in absentia.” “People don’t want to come to a dinner and feel bored or preached at. Hopefully neither of those things will happen.” Bee says she, too, will focus on celebrating the press. “We’re intending our show to really focus on honoring the press for all of the work that we vampire from them, all the hard work that people do that go into making a show like ours possible,” she told the Associated Press at an event this week. Trevor Noah, the “Daily Show” host, said he was excited to see what both Bee and Minhaj bring to the weekend’s festivities. “Maybe there’s something different that we’ll get to see from the correspondents’ dinner,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer John Carucci contributed to this report.

Harvard University uses taxpayer money to create ‘mouse fight club’ 
.B
Harvard University researchers pitted mice against each other in what one observer called a “mouse fight club,” altering one mouse’s genes and then sticking it next to an “intruder” mouse and seeing how long it took for them to go at it. But the university’s researchers forgot to mention in their press release that they’d used nearly $900,000 in federal taxpayer money to fund the study — an omission that violated longstanding federal transparency laws, according to a new report being released Tuesday by a coalition of government watchdogs. Out of 100 Ivy League schools’ projects examined by the coalition in 2016, not a single one complied with the transparency rules, effectively hiding federal taxpayers’ hand in a number of controversial animal research projects. “There’s a whole lot of wasteful experimentation on animals that the public is concerned about,” said Justin Goodman, vice president at the White Coat Waste Project, one of the groups behind the new study. “If they knew exactly how much money is being spent on some of these projects, like forcing dogs to run on treadmills until they have heart attacks, they would give a second thought about whether this is the way they want their money spent.” The transparency rule has been part of spending bills every year since 1989, when it was first inserted by the late Sen. Ted Stevens. In particular, the language governs the more than $150 billion-per-year measure that funds the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services departments. That also includes money for the National Institutes of Health, the federal government’s main research arm. Under the rule, anyone who gets federal grant money and then issues a press release, bid solicitation or other document describing the project must detail how much of their spending is from federal taxpayers and how much is from other resources. Mr. Goodman’s group teamed up with Restore Accountability, a watchdog founded by former Sen. Tom Coburn, and found poor compliance everywhere. They identified 51 noncompliant Harvard projects, 14 projects at Yale, 11 at the University of Pennsylvania, six each at Brown, Columbia and Cornell, and three each at Princeton and Dartmouth. The vast majority of projects examined by the group were funded by the National Institutes of Health, but the National Science Foundation and Defense and Veterans Affairs departments were also listed as the source of some of the money, which came to nearly $250 million in 2016 among the Ivy League. Harvard accounted for some $177 million of that. Harvard’s media relations office didn’t respond to an email requesting comment Monday on how it handles the Stevens Amendment and compliance guidance for its researchers. The problem is so extensive that the Senate’s top five waste-watchers are firing off a letter this week asking the federal comptroller general to investigate the violations. “We believe it is unacceptable for agencies and grant recipients to disregard longstanding transparency requirements, and those agencies have an obligation to spend taxpayer dollars effectively and efficiently,” GOP Sens. Jeff Flake, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, John McCain and Rand Paul said in their letter to the Government Accountability Office. For his part, Mr. Coburn, who was Congress’ top waste-watcher until his retirement more than two years ago, said it was disappointing Capitol Hill had allowed the universities to get away with hiding their ties to federal money for so long. He said outside groups have had to step in. “The report’s findings are an embarrassing, but all too familiar, example of oversight organizations doing the job Congress has failed to do. Transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent is essential for Congress to restore the American people’s trust, and these problems should be immediately addressed,” Mr. Coburn said. Mr. Goodman said there are some universities that seem aware of the policy, and even include guidance for how to comply on their grant websites. But others seem to thumb their nose at the transparency requirement. “It’s a mix of ignorance and arrogance,” he said. “It’s possible that people are not aware of the conditions that govern their accepting of taxpayers’ money, and I think there is a level of arrogance where experimenters often feel they don’t have to be accountable to anybody.” The mouse-fighting project was designed to test whether suppressing serotonin neurons would spark more aggressive behavior. Targeting two particular serotonergic neurons, the researchers concluded that “silencing either of these neuronal subtypes enhanced aggressive behavior in adulthood.” Taxpayers seem to have a penchant for funding aggression studies. The new waster report also identified a project at Northeastern University that took $3.4 million in federal funds to study whether Prozac makes hamsters more aggressive. That school also failed to disclose details required by the Stevens Amendment, the report says. Some of the projects identified by the new report were aimed at combating the Zika virus, while others targeted various forms of cancer. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump’s lawyer launches legal action against BuzzFeed for publishing ‘completely fabricated’ dossier
.B
Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s personal attorney, says he has instructed his own attorney to investigate legal action against BuzzFeed, which posted an opposition research “dossier” that accused Mr. Cohen without proof of a conspiracy with Russian agents. Mr. Cohen told The Washington Times that he also is considering a lawsuit against former British spy Christopher Steele, who wrote the gossipy 35-page dossier that the liberal news website posted on Jan. 10. Mr. Steele was paid by a Hillary Clinton supporter, via the Democratic Party-linked firm Fusion GPS, to gather dirt on candidate Trump last summer and fall. GPS circulated the Steele memos to reporters and Democrats. SEE ALSO: King says he hasn’t seen evidence of Burr ‘slow walking’ Russia investigation But it was not until BuzzFeed posted the dossier that some people named in it learned that they were accused of wrongdoing. In Mr. Cohen’s case, Mr. Steele accused him of traveling to Prague in the last week of August to meet with Russian agents to devise a plan to cover up the supposed Trump-Russia hacking of Democratic Party email servers. Mr. Cohen, the attorney for the Trump Organization for 10 years, immediately denied the accusation in January. He showed his passport to the president, his close aides and reporters to prove he had never been to Prague. He also shared his itinerary for a trip he took to Southern California at the time Mr. Steele said he was in the capital of the Czech Republic. Mr. Cohen is not alone in challenging Mr. Steele. Aleksej Gubarev, CEO of network solutions firm XBT Holding, is suing for defamation. The dossier said he ran a hacking operation to flood Democratic computer networks with porn and bugging devices. Mr. Gubarev, a tech entrepreneur, called the charges “one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern ‘journalism,’” according his libel lawsuit, which was filed in Florida state court. BuzzFeed Editor Ben Smith said he doubted the dossier was true at the time it was posted. His news site responded to the lawsuit by apologizing and striking Mr. Gubarev’s name from its website dossier, but the pages already had been copied and widely circulated. Mr. Cohen’s name remains unredacted. The charges against him continue to swirl in social media even though he has shown that the Prague meeting could not have taken place. In a statement to The Washington Times, Mr. Cohen said: “I believe the entire dossier to be inaccurate, and worse, completely fabricated. I applaud Aleksej Gubarev in bringing legal action against both Christopher Steele and BuzzFeed for creating and disseminating this fake dossier/information without a scintilla of fact checking. I am currently in discussions with foreign and domestic counsel to file similar actions.” The Steele dossier mentions Mr. Cohen more than a dozen times but on just one topic: his supposed trip to Prague to meet with Russians and cover up the supposed Russia-Trump hacking. “The agenda comprised questions on how deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the Clinton campaign and various contingencies for covering up these operations and Moscow’s secret liaison with the Trump team more generally,” Mr. Steele wrote. His final memo in December stated: “In Prague, Cohen agreed [to] contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operations, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary Clinton won the presidency. It was important in this even that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that a cyber  and other operators were stood down/able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces.” Again, Mr. Cohen said this account by Mr. Steele is fiction. He never attended such a meeting. If Mr. Cohen follows through with a lawsuit, he would be following a path paved by Mr. Gubarev in February in Florida state court against BuzzFeed and Mr. Smith, and in a London court against Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence. XBT, which operates more than 37,000 computer servers globally, has an office in Florida, where its web development company Webzilla is incorporated. Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Gubarev, 36, who left Russia in 2002 to live in Cyprus and launch tech companies, was recruited “under duress” by the FSB, Russia’s follow-on to the Soviet KGB spy service, to hack Democrats’ computers with “botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data.” Mr. Gurbarev’s lawsuit, filed by Boston attorney Evan Fray-Witzer and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney Brady J. Cobb, says the Steele narrative is “wholly and completely false.” “Although BuzzFeed and Smith specifically knew that at least portions of the dossier were untrue, they printed the entire document — without meaningful redactions — including those portions that falsely accused the Plaintiffs of participating in an alleged conspiracy to commit crimes against the Democratic Leadership, not to mention a conspiracy to undermine American Democracy and the 2016 election,” the action states. “BuzzFeed and Smith published these allegations without having even taken the most basic step of contacting the Plaintiffs to ask if the allegations had any merit,” it says. “As a result of BuzzFeed and Mr. Smith’s reckless publication of defamatory materials, he has found his personal and professional reputation in tatters.” Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Gubarev used a hacker by the name of Seva Kapsugovich. Mr. Gubarev says he doesn’t know and has never met Kapsugovich. McClatchy News reported that Kapsugovich is a twice-convicted pedophile who has been imprisoned in Russia in a facility where he has no access to the internet or cellphones. The lawsuit says Mr. Smith assigned four reporters to the dossier to try to prove or disprove it, yet none of them contacted Mr. Gubarev. The lawsuit against Mr. Steele was filed in London by the international law firm McDermott Will & Emery. It says the dossier caused Mr. Gubarev to lose clients all across Europe and that Mr. Steele made no effort to contact Mr. Gubarev. “It has caused [Mr. Gubarev] serious financial loss and is likely to do so in the future,” the lawsuit says. Mr. Steele gave interviews to journalists whom he tried to persuade to produce stories about his dossier, the lawsuit says. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Grassley takes methodical approach, follows the money to find source of ‘dodgy dossier’
.B
In February, Chuck Grassley looked out his Senate office window at Washington’s cold, unforgiving winter sky, then shook his head in disgust. The seven-term Republican from Iowa and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman had hit a wall. Spring would arrive soon and with it a torrent of questions about the young presidency of Donald Trump and exactly what happened with the November election: What was the real extent of Russian interference, and did Trump campaign officials know about it? What was the Obama administration’s role in investigating the explosive charges? Were there illegal and targeted leaks of sensitive intelligence? The accusations would fly so fast and furiously that Washington would shake. Mr. Grassley, who has played many a role in high-stakes probes on Capitol Hill, ramped up his involvement. He believed one thread of the story needed a much more muscular tug to see what would unravel — the “dodgy dossier.” With Congress now re-engaging its multiple investigations, the 35 pages of unsubstantiated, salacious opposition research by a former British intelligence officer that almost disrupted Mr. Trump’s campaign is getting a fresh look — and a new opportunity to create mischief. Mr. Grassley wants a more methodical inquiry into how the dossier  came to exist. With lawmakers returning to Washington from a two-week  Easter break, the opportunity is before them. The background behind the anti-Trump report — parts of which have been discredited but parts of which U.S. investigators are still working to verify and parts of which U.K. sources have partially verified — is classic Washington intrigue, political dirty tricks and the industry that has been built up to satisfy the need for dirt on one’s political opponent. Mr. Grassley’s efforts suggest that the dossier and those responsible for compiling and leaking its contents are re-emerging at the heart of the investigation. The dossier In January, less than two weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, CNN detailed that the existence of a graphic classified report, including memos written before and after the Nov. 8 election with compromising financial and personal information on the president-elect, had been shared with President Obama and Mr. Trump in private intelligence briefings. Essentially a data dump of negative campaign research of Mr. Trump, the dossier contended that the Russian government might use the confidential details to blackmail Mr. Trump and that there were links between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign team. It had been raising eyebrows in Washington since last summer. A handful of the city’s top-shelf politicians, intelligence chiefs and journalists claimed it had been privately circulating, but they shied away from airing the accusations because of their unverified nature. CNN also passed on publishing the contents of the dossier. The website BuzzFeed felt no need to hold back, posting its entire contents on Jan. 10. This unleashed a media rush to judgment on the material, which included details on sexual acts, elusive real estate financing schemes and a tangled web of unidentified sources. In a press conference, Mr. Trump immediately dismissed it as “a failing pile of garbage.” Its author also quickly surfaced as former British MI6 intelligence officer and Russia analyst Christopher Steele. Now in the private sector, Mr. Steele’s London-based Orbis Business Intelligence firm had been hired to research Mr. Trump. The day after Mr. Trump denounced the dossier, Mr. Steele went into hiding fearing for his life. Three weeks before that, but unreported for almost a month, a former KGB chief suspected of helping Mr. Steele turned up dead in the back seat of a black Lexus in Moscow. Battles over the dossier’s veracity have simmered ever since, sparking a furious search for Mr. Steele’s Kremlin sources. Former MI6 colleagues vigorously defended his reputation as a credible authority on the Kremlin. Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, said he passed the dossier to the FBI after it was passed to him. Other Republicans were outraged and lined up to trash the document, including Trump campaign foreign policy adviser named in the dossier, Carter Page. Last week, Mr. Page told The Washington Times that the document is “completely false” and “full of lies,” especially regarding his supposed contacts with Russian officials to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “The mistakes are so laughable and humorous they’re beyond words,” Mr. Page said. On Monday, The Washington Times reported that Mr. Trump’s attorney, a campaign volunteer and a tech company CEO, also publicly said that the parts about him in the dossier were fiction. All the while, Mr. Grassley held back judgment. He is 83 years old and has been in the Senate since 1981. His career in Washington began in 1975 when he served in the House of Representatives. During 42 years in Washington, the Iowan has endured Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Valerie Plame and Benghazi. For him, the dossier presented a Washington-style follow-the-money angle that investigators needed to pursue. The real question remains: Who paid Mr. Steele for the material? Fusion GPS Fusion GPS is Washington-based research firm started in 2009 by former reporter Glenn R. Simpson. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Simpson graduated from George Washington University and worked five years at Roll Call newspaper. He then served as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal for almost 14 years. In 1996, he joined forces with University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato to write the book “Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics.” The 430-page book explores voter disgust with the American political system. A New York Times review called it “topical, muckraking, highly opinionated — and sometimes overheated.” Ironically, the review also noted that Mr. Simpson and Mr. Sabato, who equally blame Democrats and Republicans for corruption, hoped to spark enough outrage that people would push for campaign reform. At Fusion, Mr. Simpson tended to work for Democrats. Numerous reports said the firm exploited weaknesses within Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign fundraising efforts and defended an attack accusing Planned Parenthood officials of selling aborted fetal tissue to medical researchers. Then came Russia. Starting in 2015, according to numerous sources including Mr. Grassley’s office, Fusion became involved in Russian efforts to fight the Magnitsky Act, a law created to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009. Mr. Magnitsky served as an attorney for British-American businessman Bill Browder, who has called Mr. Simpson a “professional smear campaigner.” In September 2015, Fusion was hired to conduct opposition research for Republicans battling Mr. Trump in the primaries. Fusion reportedly helped create a searchable database of public information on Mr. Trump, including old news stories and documents — that candidates could tap for opposition research. The New York Times reported that an unidentified wealthy Republican opposed to Mr. Trump paid for the work. Once Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, unidentified Democratic supporters of Mrs. Clinton took over funding Fusion’s work. In June, Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, who began compiling the memos that became the notorious dossier. Confidentiality agreements Mr. Grassley has a three-headed attack plan to learn more about Fusion. Late last month, he asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the firm properly registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act when it worked in 2015 to kill the Magnitsky Act. Mr. Grassley also reached out directly to Fusion and demanded that its principals provide him with details of Mr. Steele’s hiring and who funded the opposition research behind the dossier, including any FBI involvement. Mr. Steele and the FBI enjoy a close relationship, former British intelligence officials said, and have worked together in the investigation into international soccer’s governing body, FIFA, which triggered the resignation of its top officials, including President Sepp Blatter in June 2015. Mr. Grassley wants to know if Fusion knew of any FBI arrangements to pay Mr. Steele. He is also targeting the FBI directly, asking agents what they know about Mr. Steele, specifically if Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had dealings with the former British spy. In a letter from Mr. Grassley to the FBI late last month, the senator noted that Mr. McCabe’s wife received “nearly $700,000 from close Clinton associates during her campaign for Virginia state Senate” and that Mr. Grassley is concerned that “as the FBI’s second-in-command, McCabe could have significant influence over the ongoing investigation into allegations of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia as well.” In that letter, Mr. Grassley pointedly asked if Mr. McCabe was at all involved with Mr. Steele. The Senate probe must be thorough and methodical, Grassley aides say, because the dossier is still being quoted and used across Washington. “When political opposition research becomes the basis for law enforcement or intelligence efforts, it raises substantial questions about the independence of law enforcement and intelligence from politics,” Mr. Grassley wrote in the March 24 letter to Fusion. Just last week, CNN reported that the FBI partially relied on the dossier’s reporting to justify a request to place surveillance on Mr. Page. FBI Director James B. Comey, has also cited the Steele document in recent congressional briefings, officials told CNN. Fusion officials have declined to answer Mr. Grassley’s questions. Earlier this month, lawyers from the Washington firm Cunningham, Levy, Muse LLP, which represents Fusion, cited confidentiality agreements as a reason not to divulge who paid for Mr. Steele’s work. When Mr. Grassley’s staff followed up and asked if Fusion’s clients were willing to waive the confidentiality agreements, the firm’s lawyers replied that the clients have opted not to be known.

Democrats cling to intel dossier riddled with fiction in desperate attempt to take down Trump 
.B
An anti-Donald Trump “dossier” created by a former British spy and financed by Democratic-linked money has significant detractors: the people accused of crimes in a supposed Trump-Russia conspiracy. Three men — Mr. Trump’s attorney, a campaign volunteer and a tech company CEO — have publicly said that the parts about them in the dossier are fiction. A fourth figure — a Russian diplomat whom Londoner Christopher Steele accused of lawbreaking — said via Russia’s Foreign Ministry that the dossier is fantasy. And there is evidence to back him up. The 35-page dossier by Mr. Steele has taken on critical importance in recent weeks for Democrats in Washington. They cite its accusations without corroboration as the reason for a special commission to investigate Mr. Trump and his aides for a supposed role in Russia’s hacking of Democratic Party email servers. Lost in the Democrats’ endorsements are the people who say Mr. Steele’s supposed chronicle of meetings and misdeeds is untrue. McClatchy News reported that the man Mr. Steele identified as spearheading part of the hacking operation was (and still is) in a Russia prison at the time with no access to the internet or a cellphone. Mr. Steele was paid by Fusion GPS, a Democratic Party-aligned opposition research firm that was trying to bring down the Trump candidacy last year. Fusion GPS spread the dossier around Washington to reporters and Democrats. Once it was published in January by Buzzfeed, whose editor doubted its accuracy, the denials started. Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, said he has never been to Prague — the city where Mr. Steele said he met secretly in late August with Russian intelligence to discuss Moscow’s hacking and how to cover it up. When the supposed meeting took place, Mr. Cohen was with his family in Southern California. He has shown his passport to Mr. Trump and aides and provided his itinerary for when he visited California. Carter Page, a volunteer Trump campaign surrogate, said he never met in Moscow with two Kremlin-connected men, an oil executive and a Kremlin figure. Mr. Steele said Mr. Page, who was in Moscow to give two pubic talks, met them and planned Russia’s hack into the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Page, who has done business with Russian energy firms for more than a decade, said he has never met Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager. Mr. Steele said the two conspired as liaisons to Russian intelligence. The CEO of a Russian tech company, Aleksej Gubarev, has filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Steele. Mr. Steele accused Mr. Gubarev’s XBT Holdings of “using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data” against Democrats. Though it has not received a lot of attention, there is another Steele-described conspiracy for which public evidence is lacking. Mr. Steele’s plot line revolves around a Russian diplomat named Mikhail Kalugin. Mr. Kalugin headed the economic section at the Russian Embassy in Washington, where he was posted for six years before returning in August to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow, where he works today. Mr. Steele, in one of his last memos to Fusion GPS that comprised the complete dossier, spins a far more sinister tale. Mr. Kalugin was at the center of an illegal money-skimming operation run out of the embassy. Pensions destined for Russian veterans in the U.S. were diverted to fund the hacking of Democratic Party computer networks. Encounters with Kalugin The alleged Russian hacking brought intense political and media heat on Moscow in August. Moscow abruptly whisked Mr. Kalugin out of Washington, Mr. Steele wrote, in a Sept. 14 memo titled “US: Kremlin Fallout from Media Exposure of Moscow’s interference in the U.S. presidential campaign.” Mr. Steele wrote, “Finally, speaking separately to the same compatriot, a senior Russian [minister of foreign affairs] official reported that as a prophylactic measure, a leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail [Kalugin], had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operation, including the so-called veterans pensions ruse (reported previously), would be exposed in the media there.” The Russian Foreign Ministry denied all of Mr. Steele’s charges involving Mr. Kalugin and pensions. Vladimir Putin’s government also denied hacking Democrats in the face of U.S. intelligence assessments that it did, so a Russian denial of Mr. Kalugin is not definitive. But there is independent evidence that Mr. Steele’s story is wrong. Americans who knew Mr. Kalugin and worked with him on economic projects said he told them months before his departure that he and his family planned to return to Russia as a normal diplomatic rotation. Russian diplomats typically spend three years at an embassy before transfer, but the U.S. is such an important account that diplomats typically serve longer. One of the Americans is Earl Rasmussen — a retired Army officer, West Point graduate and technology consultant in Washington. He is also vice president of the Eurasia Center, which works to create economic ties between the U.S. and European-Asian countries. He had a number of encounters with Mr. Kalugin. Mr. Rasmussen told The Washington Times: “He was definitely not ‘withdrawn on short notice.’ It was a scheduled departure and one where several people that may have interfaced with him and his staff directly knew that he was leaving several months earlier and who his replacement was scheduled to be. Moreover, while many of us know people who work in the clandestine world, I had significant interaction with Mr. Kalugin, and never have I detected any type of covert actions or even an indication of preferences regarding the political campaign. My experience with him was that he was a very good professional in the economic area and sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations.” The Times asked Mr. Rasmussen, who was interviewed last winter by McClatchy, to recall the chronology. “Mikhail was actually on an extension of a typical assignment/tour,” he said in an email. “I knew he was due to leave summer of 2016 probably sometime summer or fall of 2015. I knew the actual month/time period of his rotation (July/August 2016) about 5 or so months out. The topic came up while we were in the planning stages of annual BRICS [a group of five emerging economies] conference held every spring that I am involved with organizing.” ‘Defies logic’ The Washington Times also spoke with a senior former State Department official who had contact with Mr. Kalugin. The former official described Mr. Kalugin as a functioning diplomat who visited the State Department and accompanied the Russian ambassador during meetings dealing with global economics. The former official recalled that when the ambassador needed a statistic to make a point, Mr. Kalugin was quick to provide it. “I have more than a passing acquaintance with the Russian Embassy staff,” the former diplomat said. “I saw him at a lot of events. We had regular normal contact with him doing stuff that typically diplomats do. I can tell you he is quite knowledgeable about the economy.” The former official said Mr. Kalugin’s resume showed a logical progression for a diplomat specializing in economics. He is now back at the Foreign Ministry in a policy shop. “This is not a deep-cover guy,” the former official said. “I dealt with lots of Russians over the past 30 and 40 years, and I can tell you he preformed his duties professionally and competently. Maybe he’s the world’s most super-secret spy.” Of the dossier, the former diplomat said, “There is stuff in there that just defies logic. Lots of it.” The dossier generally was shunned by the mainstream media as it circulated through Washington’s corridors during the campaign. The reason: It could not be confirmed. But elements of it did appear sporadically couched as being from intelligence sources. Today, the Steele creation is cited by Democrats trying to get Congress to appoint a special commission and by some liberal news websites that contend it is true. After reading aloud from the Steele paper at a March 20 hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, said: “I believe that we would benefit from the work of an independent commission that can devote the staff resources to this investigation that we do not have. And it can be completely removed from any political considerations.” Two other Democrats read parts of the dossier into the hearing record. There has been no public, independent verification of Mr. Steele’s charges against Mr. Trump or his aides. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has denied any Trump-Russian collusion. What alarms some Republicans are reports that the FBI relied on Mr. Steele and his Democrat-financed opposition research to open and conduct its Trump-Russia investigation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, sent a letter to FBI Director James B. Comey last month asking questions about the bureau’s reliance on Mr. Steele’s work. No reply has arrived. The senator is concerned about a Washington Post report that said the FBI planned to pay Mr. Steele to continue his investigation into Mr. Trump. This presumedly would mean an opposition research specialist would be investigating the president and paid by the FBI. No Republican asked Mr. Comey about this supposed arrangement when he testified at the House hearing. The New York Times reported Saturday that the FBI offered Mr. Steele $50,000 to continue investigating Mr. Trump and his aides. The Times said the deal never went through.

Air marshal left loaded gun in bathroom aboard transatlantic Delta flight: Reports
.B
A federal air marshal misplaced her loaded service weapon in the bathroom of a transatlantic flight earlier this month before it was ultimately found by another passenger, according to multiple reports. The incident happened aboard Delta Flight #221 on April 6 as the aircraft traveled to New York City from Manchester, England, CNN and the New York Times each reported this week citing several unnamed sources. The passenger who found the weapon in the aircraft’s bathroom alerted the flight crew who subsequently returned it to the air marshal, the outlets reported. Both outlets described the unidentified air marshal as a relatively new hire who failed to notify her superiors about the incident until several days later. She reportedly remains on the job, however. “You can’t have inept people leaving weapons in a lavatory,” former air marshal Craig Sawyer told the New York Times. “If someone with ill intent gets hold of that weapon on an aircraft, they are now armed.” The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said in a statement that it was aware of an unspecified incident on April 6 and is “reviewing the circumstances of this incident.” “These rare incidents must be thoroughly investigated and local managers should take appropriate corrective action,” John Casaretti, president of the Air Marshal Association, told CNN. “A field training officer program and thorough mentorship of new officers can reduce similar performance issues.” “Air marshals work in punishing conditions, labor under poor leadership and have seen their law enforcement functions curtailed by an administration that lacks vision. The problem is not the air marshals, it’s the TSA,” he insisted. A Delta spokesperson declined to comment aside from acknowledging the incident, CNN reported.

Trump turns focus to veterans, signs extension for choice in health care
.B
President Trump took one of his first steps Wednesday to address chronic problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs by signing a bill that extends stopgap services for veterans to go outside the VA medical system for care. After campaigning on the issue of improving substandard care for veterans that dogged President Obama, Mr. Trump signed a reauthorization of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act and announced that he would devote a press conference to veterans issues next week. “The veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long, and it’s time that they are recognized and it’s time that we now take care of them and take care of them properly,” Mr. Trump said. The Choice program was set to expire in August without the legislation and with nearly $1 billion unspent in the account. Congress developed the program after a scandal erupted in 2014 during the Obama administration over wait times at the VA medical center in Phoenix, where dozens of veterans died waiting for care. Veterans groups say the legislation is needed but that Congress and the Trump administration need to do much more. “They need more doctors, they need nurses,” said Garry Augustine, president of the 1.3-million-member Disabled American Veterans. “There’s a lot of things in motion now that are moving in a positive direction. But it’s the second-largest bureaucracy in the government. You don’t change it overnight.” Providing care for the nation’s roughly 21 million veterans has challenged previous administrations and sometimes has caused major political headaches for presidents who don’t adequately address problems within the VA. President George W. Bush feuded with fellow Republicans who accused him of not increasing funding enough for the VA as veterans returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama pledged to eliminate the backlog of disability and pension claims. His administration reduced it from about 600,000 to 100,000 but failed to eliminate the mountain of pending claims by the time he left office in January. Cutting into the claims backlog also resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of appeals, to a current backlog of about 450,000. Mr. Obama fired his first VA secretary, Eric K. Shinseki, in the wake of the scandal over delayed care. The Obama administration also was beset with unresolved problems of whistleblower retaliation, wasteful employee bonuses and the failure to hold accountable managers found to have engaged in wrongdoing. During Mr. Obama’s presidency, funding for the VA rose by about 85 percent, although some of that increase was the result in a rise in the total number of veterans who qualified for mandatory benefits. In fiscal 2017, the VA budget was $182.3 billion, including $78.7 billion in discretionary spending. Mr. Trump campaigned hard on improving services for veterans, saying their treatment by the previous administration was a disgrace. “Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants,” Mr. Trump said in September. The president has proposed a 6 percent boost in the VA budget for fiscal 2018. The VA is one of the few federal agencies slated for an increase in Mr. Trump’s first budget. Some veterans are encouraged by Mr. Trump’s choice of physician David Shulkin to lead the VA. Mr. Shulkin served in a top post at the agency at the end of the Obama administration. “He knew what was being done to improve it because there was improvement going on under [former Secretary Bob] McDonald and [Deputy Secretary] Sloan Gibson,” Mr. Augustine said. “Now he’s continuing the progress that was being made.” Only three months into the administration, there are ample signs of improvements that still need to be made at the VA. About one-third of veterans are going outside the system to private doctors but are encountering delays in paperwork and scheduling, as well as incorrect billing. The Washington DC VA Medical Center, a VA facility, was cited by inspectors in a report this month for its mismanagement of medical equipment, supplies and staffing. “The ongoing inventory practices at the medical center are placing patients at unnecessary risk,” VA Inspector General Mike Missal wrote in the interim report, adding that the facility’s leaders “have been slow to remediate these serious deficiencies.” The VA quickly fired the director of the D.C. medical center, calling it an “urgent patient safety issue.” “We are focused clearly on accountability. No leader or other employee stands above the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of our veterans,” Mr. Shulkin told reporters. Some VA workers say low morale and management problems at the agency have not changed. “The mood in the field is very pessimistic,” said one midlevel VA manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Personally, I am not optimistic. There are not enough resources available to provide same-day access [for patients] and keep the crumbling VA infrastructures running. They cannot meet the staffing levels of the private sector due to the bizarre nature of VA’s funding model. Yet Shulkin is threatening to fire leaders who aren’t ‘focused’ on these areas. Very demoralizing.” Mr. Shulkin said at the White House on Wednesday that the measure extending the Choice program was an example of “how we are making things better” for veterans. “By working together, we’re going to continue this progress,” he said. The Choice law allows any veterans who either have had to wait 30 days for an appointment or live 40 miles or more from the nearest VA facility to visit a private doctor. But bureaucratic problems have prevented many veterans from using the program. Mr. Shulkin has called on Congress to approve a more permanent solution to veterans’ health care. Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America who attended the bill signing, said Congress needs to expand private health care options for veterans. “The Choice program was passed as a quick fix to the wait list manipulation scandal that broke three years ago,” Mr. Lucas said. “While it’s helped, too many veterans still are forced to seek care at failing VA facilities.” Administration officials and veterans advocates portrayed the legislation as a temporary fix until lawmakers can devise long-range solutions. “What we want to do is put the veteran in charge of these choices, not the bureaucracy,” said House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman David P. Roe, Tennessee Republican. “And I think Dr. Shulkin is just the person to see that happen.” A report released Wednesday said more veterans younger than 65 have gained health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are trying to repeal and replace. The study by the nonpartisan Urban Institute found that about 429,000 veterans nationwide gained coverage in 20 states with the largest veteran populations, reducing the uninsured rate among veterans younger than 65 by nearly 40 percent from 2013 to 2015. Mr. Trump held a private meeting at the White House with Mr. Shulkin on Wednesday morning and said the VA secretary “updated me on the massive and chronic challenge he inherited at the VA, but also the great progress that he is making.” “It’s one of my most important things,” Mr. Trump said of veterans issues. “I’ve been telling all of our friends at speeches and rallies for two years about the VA, how we’re going to turn it around. And we’re doing that.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Bill O’Reilly — good riddance to bad rubbish
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Here’s the latest tale from the seedy world of Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly, which broke late Tuesday. “Another woman is telling Fox News her story of harassment at the hands of O'Reilly,” writes The Hollywood Reporter. “Bill O'Reilly used to leer at an African-American Fox News clerical worker and called her ‘hot chocolate,’ according to attorney Lisa Bloom, who helped the woman report the harassment to the network’s hotline. The woman worked for a different broadcaster in 2008 while this was going on, but ‘The O’Reilly Factor’ host’s office was near her desk,” the magazine wrote. According to the woman’s attorney, Mr. O'Reilly “would never talk to her, not even hello, except to grunt at her like a wild boar. He would leer at her. He would always do this when no one else was around and she was scared.” Now, maybe that’s a one off. Maybe this accuser is a gold digger targeting a high-profile personality to make a little scratch. That happens. Oh wait, she’s not. “The new O'Reilly accuser who I represent is not asking for money, just accountability,” Ms. Bloom tweeted. With Mr. O'Reilly, so many shoes have dropped that he’s looking like Imelda Marcos. Just two weeks ago, The New York Times reported that Fox paid out $13 million to five women who accused the bombastic bloviator of sexual harassment. Mr. O'Reilly told The Times that he settled only to avoid hurting his family. Well, that isn’t what an innocent man would do. Accuse me of sexual harassment and we’re going all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to. I’m not paying a dime ‘cuz I’m not guilty. Only guilty people pay out “settlements,” which are better known by this term: “hush money.” Internet provocateur Matt Drudge sees the end coming. “O'Reilly has had tremendous run. Very few in the business get to decide when and how things end. Media is most brutal of all industries,” Mr. Drudge tweeted out minutes after the “hot chocolate” story hit the web. Well, Billy isn’t exactly deciding “when and how things end,” although he can’t be surprised — after his despicable actions — when the hammer comes down. Fox News is mired in sex of late. Former CEO Roger Ailes resigned amid a flurry of sordid accusations. The network paid former Miss America Gretchen Carlson $20 million in hush money — I mean, to keep Mr. Ailes from “hurting his family.” Accusations have mounted that women were treated like sex objects throughout the network — fired for not acquiescing to Mr. Ailes or Mr. O'Reilly, ordered to dress sexier, and worse. The saddest thing is that some women no doubt fell prey to the two predators. You don’t keep asking women to your hotel room, like Mr. O'Reilly is accused of having done repeatedly, if it doesn’t work every so often. Those women are likely far too ashamed to come forward now, and that’s sad. They, too, are victims. Mr. O'Reilly, who took a sudden “vacation” (possibly to keep from “hurting his family”), is nowhere to be seen. And he won’t be seen, ever again. Although his contract was recently upped to $20 million per year, the network is said to be eager to cut its losses and go an entirely new direction without the cantankerous, and rancorous, blowhard. Now, I’ve never seen one second of his show. The last thing I want to do while relaxing in the evening is to listen to some ultracrepidarian spout his meaningless nonsense — yelling at guests and rudely interrupting experts in their field. Who has time for a bullying gasbag? Life’s just too short. Still, he brought in millions for the network, and millions of people tuned in. Fox News would have preferred to sweep the whole matter under the rug and keep the ad dollars pouring in. That’s why they paid off victims of the two predators. In media, like in politics, the end often justifies the means. But nothing could save Mr. Ailes when the story reached critical mass, and nothing can save Mr. O'Reilly now. Where there’s smoke there is always fire — no fire, no smoke. He won’t even be saved by President Trump (who isn’t the greatest character witness himself, having once been caught on tape saying he likes to “grab ‘em by the p–y”). “I think he’s a person I know well — he is a good person,” Mr. Trump told The New York Times two weeks ago. “I think he shouldn’t have settled; personally, I think he shouldn’t have settled. Because you should have taken it all the way. I don’t think Bill did anything wrong.” But that’s what innocent people do. Guilty people try to cover up their crimes — and rich ones sometimes get away with it. Not this time. Mr. O'Reilly is about to disappear once and for all. And to that we say good riddance to bad rubbish. • Joseph Curl has covered politics for 25 years, including 12 years as White House correspondent at The Washington Times.

Atty. Gen. Sessions should empanel grand jury to probe intelligence leaks
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION An extraordinary scenario is taking place right out  in the open, and we all seem to be missing it. The subject is the  utterly incompetent protection our “intelligence community” (as they  like to be called) is providing for the nation’s most precious secrets. It  was bad enough when a young contractor named Edward Snowden could steal  millions of classified records pertaining to the plans, strategies,  surveillance, identities, and reports of all types and pass these files  to WikiLeaks founder, Swedish gadfly Julian Assange, who promptly  disclosed the whole lot to the entire world (2013). But this adventure  foreshadowed the popular response to all the subsequent WikiLeaks. What  happened were cries of righteous indignation — against whom? Against  the keepers of these secret files, who allowed this to happen? Not at  all. The outrage was against the little leaker, Mr. Snowden. The outrage  was so intense and so universal that Mr. Snowden was forced into exile. But  surely, the primary sin was the work (or lack thereof) performed by our  esteemed “intelligence community,” whose responsibility it is to guard  the nation’s secrets against all comers. But they couldn’t even stop a  young contractor. The next big  leak was at the hands of another young American, a transgender Army  corporal named variously Bradley or Chelsea Elizabeth Manning, who  perpetrated the largest public disclosures of military secrets in the  history of the United States (2014). So, who went to jail? Manning.  What about those senior officials up and down the line of command whose  incompetence allowed such a thing to happen? Not one was ever even  accused, let alone indicted, of treason or even dereliction of duty. No  wonder there have been further violations of our national security. This  time (2017), there is a casual admission by the FBI and the rest of the “intelligence community” that the Russians have systematically  hacked into our national security data – although no public evidence has  been produced to that effect. All the Washington wonks are assuming  that the purpose of this intrusion was to trifle with the American  election. Interestingly, that charge seems to assume that WikiLeaks  obtained the Podesta emails from the Russians and used it to damage the  Hillary Clinton campaign. In  the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, this assumption is  so much poppycock. In the first place, Mr. Assange himself maintains that  the data were obtained from a disgruntled Clinton campaign worker.  Secondly, this is not a far-fetched claim, based on the identity and  type of little guys who pulled off much greater and more damaging  disclosures in the past. Thirdly, the disclosures were true. No one has  ever denied the authenticity of the material, damning as it was to  Mrs. Clinton herself. So, this whole house is built upon sand – there is  nothing there but the angry musings of a defeated campaign trying  desperately to blame someone else for their own failures. But  what about the cyber security which protects the nation’s secrets? Are  we being informed that once again, there has been a catastrophic  breakdown of that shield? Who is responsible for that? We know that  Barack Obama, in his last days in office, geometrically expanded the  number of agencies (from one to 17) and people (unknown hundreds) who were  to be given access to raw (unmasked) data.  It has also been reported  that Mr. Obama authorized continued access of Hillary Clinton and six aides  to the same top secret material she had as Secretary of State,  presumably right up to the election. This in spite of her obvious  disdain for the laws and rules governing such access. This  cavalier attitude toward cyber protection clearly does not bode well  for the state of the art. Further, there seems little doubt that the  Obama Democrats spied on the Trump transition team. That is a violation  of the law and Americans would like to see somebody go to jail this  time, someone to keep Manning company. But  no one seems to be talking about these failures of the “intelligence  community.” It is time to clean up the flagrant incompetence surrounding  cyber protection of our national secrets. Those responsible must be  held accountable, and a new team appointed to the task. The  new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, should also empanel a grand jury to investigate  the people and the reasons behind this breakdown to determine whether  laws have been broken. Obviously, the FBI under the perpetually confused  and confusing James Comey can’t handle the job. If the likes of Snowden  and Manning can penetrate our national security, surely the Russians,  the Islamic State, North Korea and who knows who else shouldn’t have any  trouble.

Carter Page rebuts Democrats latching onto ‘completely false’ Russia dossier
.B
Carter Page, the Trump campaign’s onetime volunteer adviser on Russia, views with amazement how much a Democratic opposition research dossier has been increasingly embraced by the liberal power structure in Washington. He told The Washington Times that he is stunned because the dossier is “completely false” and “full of lies” about his supposed conduct vis-a-vis Russia last summer. The FBI, which obtained a copy of the dossier, has been investigating the conduct since July. “The mistakes are so laughable and humorous they’re beyond words,” Mr. Page said of a dossier that has him meeting with Russians whom he insists he has never met. “It’s just so wild that it’s amazing.” Not one of the sensational allegations in the Democrat-financed memos from former British spy Christopher Steele has been verified independently, at least publicly. Yet Democrats are citing the dossier as a reason to achieve their major political objective — an independent investigative commission on Trump-Russia. Democrats say routinely on cable news channels that some of Mr. Steele’s findings have been confirmed, but they do not specify which ones. Mr. Steele’s gossipy, thirdhand anecdotes contain a central allegation: There was an elaborate conspiracy between Trump campaign aides and the highest levels of the Kremlin to hack the Hillary Clinton campaign computers, release stolen emails and spread disinformation. Mr. Page was smack dab in the middle, said chief accuser Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence firm in London. Mr. Page runs investment firm Global Energy Capital LLC in New York City. Before that, he was an investment banker for Merrill Lynch and spent three years in Moscow last decade making deals with Russian businesses. His knowledge of and communications with Russians is part of his livelihood. He has been doing exactly what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged American entrepreneurs to do in 2012 as she stood next to then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. “We are committed to broadening and deepening ties between our two economies,” she said in Moscow. The Steele dossier, written as a series of memos during the summer and fall, hit the streets Jan. 10 via the news website Buzzfeed, whose editor publicly doubted its veracity. The memos contained sensational charges that Mr. Page colluded with Putin oligarchs. In The Times interview, Mr. Page specifically rebutted all of the accusations. There are four main charges concerning Mr. Page: • Mr. Steele wrote that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s summertime campaign manager, and Mr. Page formed an alliance to work with Russian intelligence to hack the Clinton campaign. Mr. Page called this assertion “ridiculous.” Referring to himself as a “junior paid volunteer,” he said he has never met Mr. Manafort. “Steele is saying I’m conspiring with Manafort. It’s so fictional,” he said. • Second, Mr. Steele wrote that during Mr. Page’s July trip to Moscow to give a speech at the New Economic School, he held a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, president of the state-owned Rosneft oil company and a close ally of President Putin. Mr. Page said he delivered an unpaid speech at the university, a talk that was covered by the news media that day. Mr. Page said he has never met Mr. Sechin. “No, I have never met him,” he said. “It’s totally false.” • Mr. Steele also wrote that Mr. Sechin offered Mr. Page a brokerage fee when Russia sold a 19 percent stake in Rosneft to outside investors. In exchange, the Trump adviser was to urge the candidate to end economic sanctions against Russia. Mr. Page said no one ever made such an offer. • In his fourth charge against Mr. Page, Mr. Steele wrote that, while in Moscow, Mr. Page also met with a man named Igor Divyekin, a Russian official. He supposedly told Mr. Page that the Kremlin had compromising information on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, as well as Mr. Trump. Mr. Page said the first he ever heard of Mr. Divyekin was from the dossier. He told The Times: “I had never heard of him. I asked a lot of people I knew in Moscow, all people from the university, some business friend people, ‘Have you ever heard of this guy?’ “I’m very careful that the things I say are accurate. If I’m going to say I did not meet him, I may have said hello to someone, right? So I wanted to be double, triple, quadruple sure that what I’m saying is accurate, right? “Not only had I never heard of him, everyone I asked had never heard the guy’s name. He’s not a known person. He’s like someone in the bureaucracy who may have an important position but not someone who is publicly known and not someone I met with.” Intel committee ‘facts’ The Steele paper, financed by Democrats via the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, has been denounced as inaccurate by some in the news media, by former Obama administration intelligence officials and by the Trump team. James R. Clapper, former director of national intelligence, said his agency could not verify any of Mr. Steele’s sources. Former Deputy CIA Director Michael J. Morell, a Clinton adviser, said he learned that Mr. Steele did not talk to sources directly but with paid intermediaries. “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke but there is no fire, at all,” Mr. Morell said at an event sponsored by security analysis website The Cipher Brief. “There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.” In his most sensational allegation, Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, met in Prague with Russian intelligence officials. Mr. Cohen has presented evidence that he was in Southern California at the time. He said he has never been to Prague and showed the campaign his passport to prove it. In other words, a critical meeting evincing a Trump conspiracy could not have happened, casting doubt on Mr. Steele’s investigative methods and other claims of secret get-togethers. What’s more, Russian tech CEO Aleksej Gubard is suing Mr. Steele for charging that his firm was involved in Russian-sponsored hacking into Democrats’ emails. Yet Mr. Page watched with amazement on March 20 as Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence read portions of the Steele dossier into the record as certified facts. They were led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee’s ranking Democrat. At the committee’s first public hearing in its probe into Russian interference in the Nov. 8 election, Mr. Schiff read Mr. Steele’s version of Mr. Page’s visit to Moscow. He offered no independent verification. Mr. Schiff gave Mr. Steele credit for knowing the precise share — 19 percent — that oil company Rosneft planned to sell, when in fact the Russian government had announced that percentage months before Mr. Steele wrote the memo. It was public knowledge. At the March 20 hearing, FBI Director James B. Comey announced that he had been authorized by the Justice Department to disclose that the bureau was investigating any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The Washington Post reported this month that the Obama Justice Department obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court warrant to surveil Mr. Page as a foreign agent, beginning in July. This was about the same time the FBI obtained the Steele dossier. Questions for the FBI The question some Republicans are asking is: Did the Steele dossier prompt the Obama administration to open the investigation into candidate Trump? And did the administration cite information in the dossier as evidence to obtain the warrant? The intrigue grows deeper. The Post reported Feb. 28 that the FBI reached a financial agreement with Mr. Steele to continue investigating Mr. Trump. If true, the agreement created the odd marriage of a partisan Democrat-paid investigator being hired by the FBI to investigate the future president a few weeks before the election. The deal never went through because the dossier and Mr. Steele’s name had become public, The Post reported. The timeline (the dossier went public in January) would mean that the FBI wanted Mr. Steele to investigate President-elect Trump and ultimately President Trump. The Washington Times asked the FBI to confirm or deny that it had made such a deal. The public affairs office declined. The New York Times reported that Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele spread the dossier to journalists and to the FBI. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, has begun pressing the FBI for answers on what role the dossier played as the bureau made decisions to investigate and surveil Trump aides. “The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for president in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends,” Mr. Grassley said in a March 6 letter to Mr. Comey, the bureau’s director. He demanded a reply by March 20 and asked for documentation of agents’ interviews with Mr. Steele. A subsequent Grassley letter said the FBI had missed the March 20 deadline. A key Grassley question: “Has the FBI relied on or otherwise referenced the memos or any information in the memos in seeking a FISA warrant, other search warrant or any other judicial process?” He also asked: “Has the FBI verified or corroborated any of the allegations made in the memos? Were any allegations or other information from the memo included in any documents created by the FBI, or which the FBI helped to create, without having been independently verified or corroborated by the FBI beforehand? If so, why?” Mr. Grassley on March 24 targeted Democratic Party-linked Fusion GPS, run by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn R. Simpson. “When political opposition research becomes the basis for law enforcement or intelligence efforts, it raises substantial questions about the independence of law enforcement and intelligence from politics,” Mr. Grassley wrote to Mr. Simpson. On April 7, Fusion’s attorneys of the Washington firm Cunningham, Levy, Muse LLP wrote to Mr. Grassley saying the company would not answer the chairman’s questions. ‘Under surveillance’ “The March 24 letter calls for information and documents protected by the First Amendment rights, attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, and contractual rights (e.g., confidentiality agreements) of Fusion GPS and/or its clients,” the letter said. “Thus, so as to preserve those privileges and rights, we will not otherwise be responding to the questions enumerated within the March 24 letter.” Mr. Page told The Washington Times that he, too, would like to know what role the unproven dossier played in the Obama administration persuading a judge to approve a wiretap on him. “When you lie to a court, the FISA court is a court, that is a crime,” he said. The Steele dossier appears to have made its way into intelligence briefings to members of Congress and then into news stories, though the Steele memos were not identified as the source. In September, months before Buzzfeed published the raw Steele memos, a story appeared in Yahoo News. It cited intelligence sources as saying they were investigating whether Mr. Page secretly met in Moscow with Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin — the two names found in the Steele dossier. Again, Mr. Page told The Times that he had never met with those two Russians. Mr. Page said that story spelled the end to his volunteer work for Mr. Trump. Campaign representatives said he was not part of the Trump team. Before the Yahoo story, then-Sen. Harry Reid wrote a letter to Mr. Comey in August. He did not name Mr. Page but referred to a “Trump adviser” who was accused of meeting with “high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow.” The charge appears to come right out of the Steele investigation which had been turned over to the FBI. Mr. Page was an ideal suspect for liberals to accuse of Moscow collusion, given his pro-Moscow stances, his opposition to economic sanctions and his investments in Gazprom, the Russian natural gas firm. Mr. Reid said it was a conflict of interest for a Trump surrogate and investor in Russia to be promoting an end to sanctions. Mr. Page said the focus of his investments since founding Global Energy in 2008 has been the Middle East, Africa, Asia and North America. Mr. Page served as a Navy officer from 1993 to 1998, achieving the rank of lieutenant. He received the Joint Service Commendation Medal as a U.N. military observer in the Western Sahara. He received the Navy Achievement Medal for his work with the USS America aircraft carrier battle group in the Adriatic Sea during the Bosnia conflict. After Mr. Schiff read portions of the Steele dossier at the March 20 intelligence committee hearing, Mr. Page sent a letter to him and committee Chairman Devin Nunes, California Republican. “I would eagerly welcome the chance to speak with the committee to help finally set the record straight following the false evidence, illegal activities as well as other lies distributed by certain politically motivated suspects in coordination with the Obama administration, which defamed me and other Americans,” he wrote. Directly responding to Mr. Schiff’s reliance on the unproven dossier, Mr. Page wrote: “Amongst many other complete lies, this excerpt from the highly inaccurate dossier concocted by the political consultant Mr. Steele remained one of the primary false allegations against me throughout much of last year. “Extensive recent reporting by The New York Times and other news organizations has been built on a foundation of many falsehoods with potential support from members of the Obama administration,” he wrote. In a separate letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last month, Mr. Page described his business routine: He works from an office building attached to the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, dines at the Trump Grille, meets associates in the Trump Tower Starbucks and has attended campaign events there. Thus, he charged, the FBI surveillance of him by the Obama administration amounted to surveilling the Trump campaign. “So if prior media reports may be believed that surveillance was indeed undertaken against me and other Trump supporters, it should be essentially deemed as a proven fact that the American people’s concerns that Trump Tower was under surveillance last year is entirely correct,” he said, a reference to President Trump’s assertion that his office was “wiretapped” by the Obama administration. Asked about the status of the FBI investigation, Mr. Page told The Washington Times, “I’m quite optimistic in the direction this is heading.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

IRS needs a fresh start without John Koskinen
.B
Tax Day is one of the most dreaded days on the calendar for American taxpayers. As Americans are forced to spend hours upon hours deciphering the tax code, and then hand over large portions of their hard-earned income, the day serves as an annual reminder both of how bloated the federal government is, and how unwieldy the tax code is. For conservatives, though, Tax Day is a much more insidious reminder. It is also an annual reminder of how obtrusive - and yes, abusive - the IRS has become. For years, the out-of-control and unaccountable agency engaged in a systematic targeting of tea party and other conservative individuals and organizations - largely without consequence. Nearly four years after the targeting came to light, Lois Lerner - the senior IRS official who did more than anyone else to orchestrate the targeting - has evaded any type of punishment for her wrongdoing, and John Koskinen, the agency’s commissioner, is still in his post, despite having obstructed multiple congressional investigations. The IRS scandal is actually two distinct scandals, and it is important to evaluate each one separately. The first scandal was the years-long targeting of conservatives based solely on their political leanings. Lois Lerner was one of the chief implementers in this Phase One scandal, and she personally made decisions that clamped down on the tea party movement, denied conservatives the ability to exercise free speech and political organization, and created an environment of fear and uncertainty among private American citizens. The second scandal, which began back in May of 2013 when the first scandal became public knowledge and - incredibly! - continues to this day, has been the IRS’s massive cover-up of the first scandal. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is largely to blame for the IRS’s wrongdoing in this iteration of the scandal; Koskinen has been at the helm of the organization as it has engaged in repeated instances of lying to congressional investigators, destroying and hiding critically important evidence, and, in general, making a mockery of our nation’s criminal investigation methods. The casualty of the first scandal was free speech; of the second scandal, the rule of law. The IRS, through its brazen misconduct, ran roughshod over these two cherished pillars of freedom in our country. And, to this day, the IRS and its senior officials, have gotten away with it. Is it any wonder that Americans have lost faith in the system and believe Washington operates under its own special set of rules? With President Trump’s victory in November, there is renewed hope that these two IRS scandals can finally be thoroughly and fairly investigated and those responsible for perpetuating the scandals will be held accountable. Leading the way are two Republican congressmen - Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Peter Roskam, the chairman of that same committee’s tax subcommittee. In a letter, the two congressmen asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to give the IRS investigation a “fresh look” to evaluate whether or not Lois Lerner should face criminal charges. In a separate letter to President Trump last week, Brady and Roskam, joined by many of their Republican colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, asked that President Trump take the much-needed action of firing Commissioner John Koskinen. Firing Koskinen and properly evaluating whether or not Lerner should be criminally charged are both necessary actions. They are also long overdue. President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have the opportunity to do the right thing here and to help restore Americans’ confidence in our institutions and in Washington, DC’s ability to abide by the same rules the rest of Americans must follow. Because of its expansive authority and its access to intensely personal information about every American citizen, the IRS has an obligation to live under the strictest code of conduct. The most feared government entity has been able to get away with thumbing its nose at the law, ridiculing our system of checks and balances, and eroding our individual liberties guaranteed in the Constitution. These actions, commonplace in banana republics, are unseemly in a country that cherishes the rule of law and has been a world leader championing free speech. While GOP House leaders are asking for a “fresh look” into this investigation, Americans are asking for a fresh start at the IRS with new leadership and full and complete resolution of these scandals. President Trump and Attorney General Sessions could deliver that fresh start at an agency badly in need of discipline and oversight. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Trump riles conservatives by reversing campaign stance, embracing Ex-Im Bank
.B
President Trump’s embrace of the Export-Import Bank is a major blow to conservatives, who had been on the verge of nixing what they — and Mr. Trump, until now — called a sop to wealthy corporations. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump dismissed the obscure lending agency as “featherbedding” for politicians and huge companies that don’t need it, enthusing opponents who had squeezed its lending powers and said it should die off. But the president now says he is convinced that the corporate welfare produces jobs — an about-face that irked conservatives who have been fighting for years to end the loan program. “Unless the Trump administration has reforms that can get Ex-Im out of the business of picking winners and losers with taxpayer dollars, then it will be difficult to see any upside in this,” said Doug Sachtleben, a spokesman for the Club for Growth, a conservative group that urged Congress to let the bank expire. Lawmakers came close in 2015, when the bank’s charter expired, but a coalition of liberals and centrists rallied to revive it. Still, conservatives have blocked nominees to the board, denying it the quorum needed to approve any deals exceeding $10 million, hoping to hobble the bank for now ahead of a final death blow when the charter expires again in 2019. Mr. Trump, though, said this week that he now thinks the bank is a good idea. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “But also, maybe more important, other countries give [assistance]. When other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.” The president said he would nominate people to fill the vacant seats on its board, placing pressure on senators to confirm his picks so the bank can begin clearing a backlog of 40 board-level transactions worth $30 billion. As it stands, only two of the five seats on the board are filled, after Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby blocked President Obama’s picks from receiving a vote. Sen. Mike Crapo, Idaho Republican and the panel’s new chairman, hasn’t said whether he intends to act on potential nominees. “We’re not commenting on Ex-Im at this time,” Banking Committee spokeswoman Amanda Critchfield said Thursday. A product of the New Deal, the bank primarily provides financing for U.S. companies looking to sell their goods overseas when private funding is not available. Establishment players like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce cheered Mr. Trump’s change of heart, and vocal Republicans said it was a “huge” turn of events for manufacturers and workers back home. “The Ex-Im Bank makes money for the American taxpayer and allows American manufacturers to compete for business in the developing world on a level playing field. Well done, Mr. President,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican. Mr. Graham had predicted Mr. Trump’s about-face since last year, when as president-elect he intervened to save hundreds of manufacturing jobs at the Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana. The bank said it sends any surplus from the interest and fees it assesses back to the Treasury, resulting in a $5.6 billion profit for taxpayers since fiscal 2007. That appeared to help sway the president. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing,’” Mr. Trump said of the bank’s lending model in the Journal interview. “But actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” Yet conservative pressure groups said they won’t let Ex-Im roar back to life without a fight. “Rather than pursuing policies that subsidize foreign companies and governments,” Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said, “lawmakers should be advancing policies that truly make America great again.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

After campaigning as a disruptor, Trump shifts policies to conform to Republican establishment
.B
Abandoning his tough talk on China and reversing himself on several other campaign themes, President Trump’s 12th week in office could go down as the moment he showed himself to be another establishment Republican, not the unconventional crockery-smashing raging bull he played on the stump. In the past week, Mr. Trump ordered missile strikes against the Syrian military after telling voters during the campaign that the U.S. was involved in too many military operations overseas. Mr. Trump proclaimed Wednesday that NATO is no longer obsolete, after questioning the U.S. commitment to the alliance on the campaign trail. Also this week, Mr. Trump declared that he will not label China as a currency manipulator, after campaigning relentlessly on a promise to do just that. The president also expressed support for the Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans for U.S. companies. During the campaign, Mr. Trump sympathized with conservatives who said the bank is an example of “crony capitalism.” Mr. Trump even called the members of the media “very honorable people” Thursday during a meeting with first responders at the White House. It amounted to at least four major reversals or policy shifts in seven days, which could be a record for a president in his first 100 days. “If there was only one of them, it would be seen as a rather remarkable shift,” said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. “The fact that there are several at once is what’s unusual about the amplitude of the moment. The careening aspects of this are pretty unsettling.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer, asked Thursday whether the president intends to follow up on his tough campaign talk about China’s deceptive practices that contribute to huge U.S. trade deficits, suggested that the election rhetoric was a negotiating tactic. “The president’s tough talk was on a variety of subjects to get results for the American people,” Mr. Spicer said. “That’s what he has pledged to do: to get more jobs here, to grow more manufacturing, to keep our country safe.” China this week abstained in the U.N. Security Council on a resolution condemning Syria for bombing its own civilians with sarin gas in its long-running civil war. The move isolated Russia, which vetoed the resolution, and administration officials said it was a major diplomatic victory for the U.S. that resulted from Mr. Trump’s negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump also said he needs China’s help in pressuring North Korea to curtail its nuclear weapons program. Toward that goal, China reportedly has stopped accepting shipments of coal from North Korea. “At the end of the day, this is always about developing a better situation for the American people, and I think he’s done that,” Mr. Spicer said. Democrats have jumped on Mr. Trump’s flip-flopping on China. “On the campaign trail, Donald Trump loved telling us how tough he would be on China, and many of my constituents believed him,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, Ohio Democrat. “But since taking office he hasn’t taken a single action to stand up to them. President Trump’s weakness on U.S.-China relations and lack of a coherent trade policy will result in more job losses in communities like mine all across the country who cannot compete fairly with Chinese companies who do not have to abide by the environmental and labor standards we have in the U.S.,” Mr. Ryan said. American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said Mr. Trump isn’t moderating his positions as much as seeking pragmatic solutions for the economy and national security. “I don’t see this as a pivot. I see this as governing,” Mr. Schlapp said on MSNBC. “He’s trying to bring change to Washington.” On NATO, Mr. Spicer said the president had not shifted his support for the alliance as much as NATO has moved closer to Mr. Trump’s priorities. “He talked about the need of countries to pay their fair share, to live up to their commitments of 2 percent of GDP,” Mr. Spicer said. “He talked about the need for NATO to focus more on terrorism. NATO has done just that.” A Republican aide who is close to the White House said Mr. Trump’s shift to more traditional establishment party positions reflects an emerging alliance of two factions in the West Wing. The first is presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump. The second is White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who is aligned with Mr. Spicer, and their allies, many of whom worked at the Republican National Committee. “They’ve joined forces, and I think they’re going to get things done,” the source said. “That’s going to be a center/right coalition of policy and ideas that Republicans on the Hill will be able to swallow.” Competing with them is a third faction led by chief presidential strategist Steve Bannon, who pushes the kind of populist “America First” approach that got Mr. Trump elected. “At the end of the day, the president will remind himself and remind his staff that he’s not an ideologue, that he’s not beholden to any constituency and that he wants to get things done,” the Republican source said. “He’s a deal-maker.” Some observers say the evolution in Mr. Trump’s positions is an inevitable result of transitioning from the campaign to governing. “The Bannon voice was the lead voice in the campaign,” Mr. Grumet said. “It’s less effective if one wants to be the president of a divided country in a complex world. The elevation of the folks who want to govern is happening pretty quickly.” He said Mr. Trump’s background as a Washington outsider means that he is “fundamentally unencumbered from predictable ideology, from political debt, from a policy history and from a rigid commitment to consistency.” “You had two strains from the campaign that are fundamentally at odds: aggressive absolutism, and the assertion that the president is a deal-maker,” Mr. Grumet said. “Those are fundamentally contradictory ideas. So he ran on absolutism successfully, and now is certainly signaling that he intends to govern as a deal-maker. It’s a little bit disorienting.” A senior administration official said this week that the administration’s moves reflect a developing agility in the White House, especially with the president’s national security team, on problems including Syria, North Korea and the Islamic State group. “What we’ve been able to do in just a few short weeks is frame those problems and opportunities to understand the situations in each of these areas, to view those situations through the lens of our vital interests and the vital interests of the American people, the security of the American people and the nation’s interest, and then to establish objectives,” the official said. “What you’re seeing is a team now I think that’s able to achieve a much higher degree of agility in the area of foreign relations and the area of national security. And I think it’s going to continue to pay off in the weeks and months ahead as well,” the official said. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

GOP wants Trump to reopen criminal probe into ex-IRS exec Lerner
.B
Two top Republicans asked the Justice Department on Wednesday to take a new look at the evidence against former IRS senior executive Lois G. Lerner to see whether charges should still be brought against her for targeting Tea Party groups and losing key evidence in the case. Ms. Lerner was cleared after an investigation by the Obama administration but Reps. Kevin Brady and Peter Roskam, respectively the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the panel’s tax policy subcommittee, say there are plenty of questions with how that probe was run, and said that a new look by the Trump administration’s Justice Department is warranted. “Taxpayers deserve to know that the DOJ’s previous evaluation was not tainted by politics,” the congressmen said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But William W. Taylor, Ms. Lerner’s lawyer, said she was properly cleared of charges by the previous probe. “Ms. Lerner did not violate any laws. There is no evidence that she did and no new investigation will change that reality,” he said in an email to The Washington Times on Wednesday. The IRS targeting came to light nearly four years ago after Ms. Lerner, seeking to get ahead of bad news from an inspector general’s investigation, planted a question at a conference to reveal that her agency had in fact been singling out conservative groups for intrusive scrutiny. IRS leaders had previously denied any such targeting in responses to Congress. Ms. Lerner was a central figure in the investigation, though her exact role remains in dispute. Republicans say she helped orchestrate the targeting, and released emails showing animus toward conservative groups and the GOP. But the Obama administration not only cleared her of wrongdoing, but said she was actually trying to fix things from the inside, becoming the first official to realize what the agency was doing was wrong. Mr. Brady and Mr. Roskam said their committee’s own exhaustive investigation found that Ms. Lerner did “improperly influence” the IRS to target conservative groups, denying them their right to approval for tax-exempt status. The Ways and Means Committee also determined that Ms. Lerner gave “misleading statements” to the inspector general, and said her use of a personal email to do some government business “risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information.” After the May 2013 revelation of the targeting, President Obama called for an investigation. The Ways and Means Committee issued its official referral of Ms. Lerner to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation nearly a year later. Along the way, though, even as the probe was continuing, Mr. Obama asserted that there was “not a smidgen of corruption” at the IRS. Mr. Brady and Mr. Roskam said that preempted the chance for a fair inquiry from his own employees. “It is clear that when the DOJ announced in October 2015 that it would not bring charges against Lois Lerner, the agency was following President Obama’s signal on how he wanted the investigation to be handled,” the congressmen said. At the time, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik said career prosecutors had decided against bringing charges, saying that while there was evidence of bad management and poor judgment, none of that rose to the level of a crime. Whatever the situation with the Justice Department, the IRS is still facing legal wrangling over the targeting. A class-action lawsuit involving 428 groups that were part of the targeting is still proceeding in a federal court in Ohio, and two cases are still live in a federal court in Washington, D.C. The IRS has been a target for the GOP for years — and the agency, under Mr. Obama, feuded back. Two years ago the agency siphoned money away from taxpayer services, leaving the vast majority of phone calls during tax season unanswered, as the agency tried to angle for more money out of the GOP-led Congress. Mr. Brady has called on President Trump to fire IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, saying his role in that poor customer service, and in misleading Congress about the loss of Ms. Lerner’s emails, has sapped trust in the tax agency. Efforts to impeach Mr. Koskinen had stalled in the House. His term expires in November Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

‘Unmasking’ of Trump aides reveals Susan Rice at center of multifarious controversies
.B
Inside the classical limestone State Department headquarters, America’s diplomats learn statecraft, etiquette and strategy — and generally are discouraged from use of the middle finger as a negotiating tool. Roughly two decades ago, Susan E. Rice, the youngest assistant secretary of state in history, used hers in a meeting with veteran U.S. diplomat and architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accords Richard C. Holbrooke. According to various accounts, the dispute was a classic territorial battle between two volatile personalities. The overachieving Ms. Rice regarded Mr. Holbrooke as a meddling elder. Mr. Holbrooke, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, reportedly didn’t flinch at the gesture and dismissed Ms. Rice as an upstart who lacked respect for her colleagues and the institution she served. SEE ALSO: Brian Babin asks A.G. Jeff Sessions to investigate Susan Rice’s unmasking of Trump aides As history would have it, Ms. Rice went on to play a Zelig-like role in every Obama administration foreign policy controversy, including Benghazi, the Iran nuclear arms deal, the Bowe Bergdahl-Taliban prisoner trade and the deal to disarm Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal. Now, once again, Ms. Rice finds herself front and center in America’s latest international crisis: allegations that Russia meddled in the presidential election campaign last year and the Obama White House leaked what it knew about the Trump campaign’s ties to the Kremlin. To supporters, she is a smart, accomplished woman, a onetime Rhodes scholar who evolved into a fierce advocate for Mr. Obama, often recruited to handle some of her boss’ trickiest assignments. To critics, she is a lightning rod for controversy, an unapologetic partisan who somehow shows up to the scene of every policy crime, the “Typhoid Mary of the Obama administration foreign policy,” in the memorable recent characterization of Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican. Last week, news broke that while serving as Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, she intentionally “unmasked” Trump campaign officials swept up in U.S. surveillance. Ms. Rice battled back against charges her actions were politically motivated or tied to any organized scheme to compile dirt on the Trump campaign. But the damage was already done and, once again, the pugnacious Ms. Rice found herself front and center in a partisan cage match, a recurring role in the saga of her career that has left many across Washington power circles shaking their heads. A fast rise Born in 1964 to a Cornell University economics professor and a Brookings Institution policy analyst in Washington, Ms. Rice had maternal grandparents from Jamaica and displayed serious ambition from the earliest age, dreaming of becoming a senator and excelling as a three-sport athlete and high school valedictorian. After studying at Stanford, she earned a doctorate from Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and won acclaim for a dissertation exploring peacekeeping in Zimbabwe. She quickly leveraged her credentials into a political job, serving as a foreign policy aide to Michael Dukakis’ failed 1988 presidential campaign before latching onto Bill Clinton’s victorious 1992 bid. At the Clinton White House, former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright mentored Ms. Rice until 1997, when President Clinton appointed her assistant secretary of state for African affairs. She was just 33. Often the youngest high-level official in the room, Ms. Rice was noted for slashing through bureaucracy with bold ideas as the White House re-engaged with Africa. The Washington Post quoted colleagues calling her “Wonder Woman” and “brilliant.” But others noted a chip on her shoulder. The Obama years Despite having been given a huge boost by the Clintons, Ms. Rice backed Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, citing early opposition to the Iraq War by the one-term senator from Illinois. The Clinton camp saw her as a defector, but Mr. Obama appointed her United Nations ambassador and later his national security adviser. She became one of his closest aides, but her style attracted serious enemies, reportedly torpedoing Mr. Obama’s plans to name her as secretary of state when Mrs. Clinton stepped down in 2013. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Libya exploded into civil war and Ms. Rice pushed for military intervention to end the Gadhafi regime. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon and Homeland Security Adviser — and later CIA director — John O. Brennan all opposed her. Ms. Rice won the battle, but her negotiating style was criticized as rude and overly blunt. But her real public notoriety began on Sept. 11, 2012, the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, when al Qaeda operatives attacked a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Ms. Rice was the face of the Obama administration’s response to the attack, appearing on five Sunday talk shows in one day to spread the later-debunked claim that it had been carried out not by hardened terrorists, but by a spontaneous mob angry about an anti-Islam video on the internet. Critics say her claims fit with the Obama administration’s larger narrative that al Qaeda was “on the run,” a central theme to Mr. Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. In congressional hearings exploring the deadly incident, Republicans accused Ms. Rice of misleading the American people. As accounts of her abrasive personality and weakened credibility mounted, Obama administration Middle East adviser Dennis Ross partially blamed her for ratcheting up the White House-Israel feud during the Iran nuclear arms deal. In a memoir, Mr. Ross wrote that Ms. Rice had a “combative mind-set” and “non-collaborative instincts.” After the U.S. traded five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an Army soldier who was captured after leaving his post in Afghanistan, Ms. Rice hailed the deal and claimed Sgt. Bergdahl had “served with honor and distinction.” A year later, the Army announced that Sgt. Bergdahl would be tried for desertion. On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump repeatedly denounced Mr. Bergdahl as a “dirty rotten traitor” and criticized the deal that brought him home. By the end of the Obama administration, some say, Ms. Rice, who had once been a contender to replace Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, had become a too-hot commodity within Washington diplomatic circles for more top jobs. A president’s shield Historians are fascinated with Rice-type characters, a shield or “tough guy” to protect the president from scandal or to absorb the attacks in political firestorms. President Kennedy had his brother, Robert, an enforcer unafraid of tackling the administration’s hardiest enemies. “Jack is too soft and forgiving,” their father, Joe Kennedy, once said. “You can trample all over him, and the next day he’ll be waiting for you with open arms. But when Bobby hates you, you stay hated.” The 1993 New York Times obituary for H.R. Haldeman, an aide to President Nixon who served 18 months in prison for his involvement in covering up Watergate, noted that Mr. Haldeman “relished his role in the White House as what he once called “the president’s [SOB].” Craig Shirley, author of four best-sellers on Ronald Reagan, told The Washington Times that Ms. Rice is seen less as an Obama-era enforcer and more as a liability as the administration faced mounting challenges around the globe in Mr. Obama’s second term. Ms. Rice’s ruthless streak finally undermined her career, Mr. Shirley argued. “She’s finding out what many others have found out about Washington,” he said. “They love you, and then they stop loving you.” Mr. Shirley added that in the age of “political correctness,” a female national security adviser gave her a certain protection from criticism, but even that has finally crumbled. “She was never an asset to Obama,” he said. “She was always a liability.” Unmasking Given the repeated pattern throughout her career, both supporters and critics say they are not surprised to find Ms. Rice front and center in the Obama administration’s final controversy, even as Mr. Obama, her boss, prepares his memoirs and appears wholly unconcerned with Mr. Trump’s charges that he personally ordered the tapping of Trump Tower. Last week, Ms. Rice marched into Washington’s MSNBC studio and categorically denied that she committed any wrongdoing by seeking the redacted names of Trump campaign aides, as was reported by The Times and others. Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, first announced the revelation and later stepped down from the probe. At the time of Ms. Rice’s interview with host Andrea Mitchell, she seemed at times to imply that she had, indeed, requested the identities of blacked-out Trump team names in the intelligence reports, but that the requests were part of her job, and she needed to understand the gravity of the reports intelligence agencies were compiling about Russian interference in the U.S. electoral process. “There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to, name not provided,” Ms. Rice said. “Sometimes in that context, in order to understand the significance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to request the information as to who that person was.” To protect national security, Ms. Rice said, her job often required her to learn the identity of masked U.S. officials. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, now conducting an investigation into the Russia election issue, has expressed an interest in hearing more from Ms. Rice; President Trump clearly does not think the matter is settled. In comments to The New York Times, Mr. Trump argued that Ms. Rice’s role will turn out to be “the biggest story” in the Russian hacking scandal. “I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it’s a massive, massive story. All over the world,” the president said. Asked if he thought Mr. Obama’s top security aide had committed a crime, Mr. Trump replied, “Do I think? Yes, I think.” A spokesman for Ms. Rice responded with her trademark feistiness: “I’m not going to dignify the president’s ludicrous charge with a comment.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Senate committee demands answers from United, Chicago officials on passenger’s forced removal
.B
The drama surrounding the forced removal of a United Express passenger and the response by the United CEO came to a head Tuesday, as senators condemned the incident and demanded a full investigation into the matter. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter Tuesday evening to CEO Oscar Munoz and Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation Ginger Evans evening asking for a conclusive investigation to be delivered by April 20. Mr. Munoz earlier announced a company investigation to be concluded by April 30. “The images and emerging accounts of this incident are very disturbing,” the bipartisan committee wrote in its letter. “The last thing a paying airline passenger should expect is a physical altercation with law enforcement personnel after boarding, especially one that could likely have been avoided.” The committee noted that the Chicago Department of Aviation suspended the arresting officer after the incident, but it requested a full account of policies and procedures and a list of violations. The committee wrote to Mr. Munoz that United’s explanation of the incident “has been unsatisfactory, and appears to underestimate the public anger about this incident.” A video showing a passenger being forcefully and violently removed from the plane went viral Monday. In the video, shot by passengers on Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday, a man’s screams are heard as security violently pulls him from his seat into the narrow airplane aisle. The man has been identified as Dr. David Dao. Dr. Dao, who said he had patients to see the next day, is dragged out of his seat and into the aisle. He is pulled by security officers by his arms, and there is blood on his face, his glasses are falling off, and his shirt is pulled up over his stomach. Dr. Dao was one of four randomly selected passengers to be bumped from the flight because of overbooking. The seats were going to airline employees who needed to be in Louisville for the next day’s operations. The Department of Transportation notes that overbooking is not illegal but it does require airlines to compensate passengers who are moved. Other requirements include asking for volunteers at the check-in or boarding area before randomly choosing passengers to bump. Witnesses reported that United did these and even doubled its compensation offer from $400 to $800, but nobody volunteered to delay their trip. “This whole trend of overbooking is really awful,” said Lorraine Abelow, president of Abelow PR, who works with airlines but not United. “It’s a policy they should seriously consider revising.” In addition to the committee-requested investigation, which also sought answers to United’s policy of bumping passengers, Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, and 20 colleagues signed a letter demanding more answers from United, specifically on its overbooking policy. “While it is common practice for commercial airlines to sell more tickets than there are physical seats on an aircraft to account for potential ‘no-show’ passengers, overselling tickets can have severe consequences for the traveling public,” the senators wrote. Adding to the condemnation, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called on the Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao to suspend the federal regulation that permits airlines to overbook flights. “This conduct is abusive and outrageous. The ridiculous statements, now in their third version, of the CEO of United Airlines displays their callousness toward the traveling public with the permission of the federal government,” Mr. Christie, an early Republican supporter of President Trump, said in a statement Tuesday night. “I know the Trump Administration wants to reform regulations to help the American people. This would be a great place to start,” Mr. Christie said. The video of Dr. Dao’s violent removal has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on social media, and the slow response by Mr. Munoz was seen not only as a public relations failure, but detrimental to the business as well. CBS reported that by Tuesday morning, 340 million Chinese users of the social media platform Weibo were aware of the incident. While Dr. Dao is reported to be Vietnamese, Chinese commenters were calling for a boycott of the airline, saying the incident amounted to discrimination, according to CNN. United flies to five cities in China, plus Hong Kong and Taipei, and 12 other destinations throughout Asia. Bloomberg reported that shares dropped by around 5 percent for United Continental Holdings — the parent group of United Airlines — by Tuesday afternoon. The United CEO’s first response to the incident on Twitter on Monday acknowledged the disturbing video but apologized only for “having to re-accomodate” the passenger. His response garnered a Twitter backlash for his choice of words with public relations professionals shaking their heads at the blunder. “This is crisis PR and you need to come right out and say it, not hide behind words,” said a comment by Ms. Abelow, the public relations executive. Further condemnation came when CNBC reported an internal memo by Mr. Munoz that expressed support for the actions of United employees and security personnel. He said that because the passenger was “disruptive and belligerent,” crew members were left with no choice but to call Chicago aviation security officers. “I emphatically stand behind all of you,” the memo says. By Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Munoz was pressured to backtrack on his second statement. “The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment,” the CEO wrote. “I share all of those sentiments, and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened.  No one should ever be mistreated this way. I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right,” he said. Moments before United issued that statement, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the passenger footage showed a disturbing and unfortunate incident but that it didn’t warrant a response from the federal government. “There’s plenty of law enforcement to review a situation like that, and I know United Airlines has said they are currently reviewing their own policies. Let’s not get ahead of where that review goes,” he said. “I don’t think anyone looks at that video and isn’t a little disturbed that another human being is treated that way, but again, I think one of the things people have to understand is when there is a potential law enforcement manner for the president to weigh in, pro or con, would prejudice a potential outcome.” This incident comes on the heels of another public relations disaster for the airline. Last month, two adolescent girls were almost barred from a flight for wearing leggings. The girls were flying as companions of staff on standby, and United policy dictates that staff and their companions dress business-casual in such circumstances. The girls were given skirts to put over their leggings before they were allowed to fly. The power of social media to influence a company was on display just last week when Pepsi pulled an advertisement that critics said co-opted protests to sell soda. The ad featured reality TV star and model Kendall Jenner walking through a protest. She breaks the line between protesters and police to hand an officer a Pepsi, which he accepts with a smile. Critics slammed the commercial for cheapening and commercializing protest movements such as Black Lives Matter. “Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize,” the company said in a statement last week. “We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Sen.

Brian Babin asks A.G. Jeff Sessions to investigate Susan Rice’s unmasking of Trump aides
.B
Republican lawmakers made their first official inquiry into opening an investigation of reports the Obama administration’s national security adviser and others “unmasked” several Trump campaign officials swept up in U.S. surveillance operations against foreign targets during last year’s presidential election campaign. “The astonishing reports that senior White House officials in the Obama Administration, most notably then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, may have abused their powers of office to violate the 4th Amendment protections by ‘unmasking’ the identities of U.S. citizens involved with the Donald J. Trump presidential campaign in intelligence reports gives great cause for concern,” stated a letter Rep. Brian Babin sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday. Ms. Rice finds herself embroiled in allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 election and whether the Obama White House potentially leaked what it knew about the Trump campaign’s ties to the Kremlin. Ms. Rice has denied charges that her actions were politically motivated or tied to any organized scheme to compile dirt on the Trump campaign. SEE ALSO: ‘Unmasking’ of Trump aides reveals Susan Rice at center of multifarious controversies The explosive revelation has touched a nerve in Washington and stirred speculation that she could be called to testify on Capitol Hill about Russian election meddling. On Wednesday Mr. Babin, Texas Republican, asked Mr. Sessions to consider an independent inquiry. “Ms. Rice and any others who may have been involved with these activities should be called to account to explain their actions,” he wrote. “If the facts do show that indeed these powers were abused, those responsible should be held fully accountable in a fair, impartial and independent inquiry.” Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, first announced the revelation and later stepped down from the probe. A review by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides of the intelligence reports that Mr. Nunes initially brought to light has so far found no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, multiple sources in both parties told CNN on Tuesday.

Redskins take center Chase Roullier with No. 199 pick
.B
The Redskins added depth at interior offensive line by selecting center Chase Roullier with the No. 199 overall pick in the NFL draft Saturday. The Redskins traded up to take Roullier, swapping their No. 201 pick with Minnesota for the No. 199 spot. The Redskins also swapped seventh-round picks with the Vikings, giving up their No. 220 pick for No. 230. “It’s a long wait after three days, it definitely starts to get long  but it was a very exciting call. I’m very excited to be a Washington  Redskin,” Roullier said. Roullier had six pressures as a guard in 2015 and eight pressures as a center in 2016 at Wyoming, according to Pro Football Focus. He also earned first team All-Mountain West honors as a senior after moving to center. He thinks the move helped him showcase his versatility, but that he’s best suited to play center in the NFL. “I think I’ll do very well at center. Being up there in front of the rest  of the offensive line, being able to see that defense really played to  my strengths,” Roullier said. The 6-4, 312-pound Savage, Minn., native also has a degree in mechanical engineering from Wyoming. “I think one of my biggest strengths is my consistency in my play,” Roullier said. “I  pride myself on being a pretty intelligent guy, coming from an  engineering background and you know, that really translates well onto  the field. I’m able to think on my feet pretty quickly and my play stays  very consistently throughout the game at that level.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

More Balkan trouble brewing in region famous for mischief
.B
As the old saying goes, history may not repeat itself — but it sure does rhyme. We are seeing this scenario play itself out in the Balkans. The region is a flash point, a world conflict waiting to happen. Consider the charges traded by Albania and Serbia over accession to the European Union. As one reporter from the regional news service Tsarizm stated, it is obvious there is an imposed peace in the Balkans, a peace that right now looks very fragile. Everyone knows about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian assassin in Sarajevo, which touched off World War I. As Russia reasserts itself in geopolitical affairs, steered by the consummate statesman Vladimir Putin, the memory of the bombing of Serbian forces in the Balkan wars of the 1990s is still fresh in the memory of many Russians. To this day, if an American goes to a dinner party in Moscow, the subject of Serbia will eventually come up. Moscow’s determination to reappear on the geopolitical scene can be traced to Russian feelings of impotence in the face of NATO airstrikes against their long-term Slavic ally three decades ago. The tensions between Serbia and Kosovo, which Belgrade still sees as a breakaway part of the country, have been back in the news lately. Serbia wanted to send a train into Kosovo with “Kosovo is Serbia” written all over the outside in multiple languages. The ethnic hatreds and clashing territorial claims are still there, smoldering beneath the agreements and the imposed peace, ready to reassert themselves at any time. Last week, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama angered Serbia by hinting at a greater Albanian state from Tirana to Kosovo. Many Albanians brushed it off as just rhetoric designed to pressure for the EU to speed up the accession process for certain Balkan states. However, Serbia took it seriously, as a Freudian slip revealing the true Albanian agenda. “If I said that all Serbs should live in one state, I would be hanged from a flagpole in Brussels,” said the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic. The caldron of conflicts of interest has a religious aspect that is integral to understanding the tension. The massive influx of Muslim refugees into Europe has heightened the sense of crisis. Serbia and Russia are positioning themselves as the protectors of the Orthodox faith, using the church to justify a conquest doctrine to combat Islamic forces which have attempted to do the same. Macedonia and Montenegro also have large ethnic Albanian populations. The accession of these former Yugoslavian states into NATO has angered Mr. Putin. The Kremlin has encouraged instability in the Balkans, attempting to lure the countries for the region away from the EU and back into Moscow’s orbit. So once again, you have the great powers of the world jockeying for influence in this tiny corner of Europe. The European Union is trying to keep its great globalist experiment alive. Moscow is trying to recreate buffer zones and spheres of influence on its borders. The U.S. State Department is involved, with old Obama administration diplomats balking at the new Trump “America First” doctrine and pushing the open border agenda of liberal billionaire George Soros throughout the region. With the world focused on the North Korean threat, the Middle East mess and Beijing’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, global leaders will be wise to keep an eye on this notoriously volatile corner of the Earth. • L.

U.S. admiral says Hawaii not fully protected from North Korean threat
.B
The top U.S. commander in the Pacific theater, Admiral Harry Harris, said Hawaii may not be protected from the North Korean nuclear missile threat.  North Korea has been steadily growing its nuclear arsenal and testing the ability to deliver a miniaturized warhead to far off targets via ballistic missile.  Adm. Harris stated the U.S. needed more radars and more interceptors in the Pacific. “I don’t share your confidence that North Korea is not going to attack either South Korea, or Japan, or the United States … once they have the capability,” said Adm. Harris while testifying in front of Congress today, reported Reuters. The contiguous U.S. territory, or CONUS, is also at risk, Adm. Harris testified.  “I do believe that the numbers could be improved. In other words, we need more interceptors.” The entire United States Senate has been invited to the White House to hear a briefing on the North Korean threat. Adm. Harris also called out China for its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.  “We should encourage China and be appreciative of what they are doing with regards to North Korea and we should also be willing to criticize them for their aggressiveness and coerciveness in the South China Sea.” The admiral also commented on Pyongyang’s threats to United States military forces in the region. “The weapons that North Korea would put against the Carl Vinson strike group are easily defended by the capabilities resident in that strike group,” he said. “If it flies it will die, if it’s flying against the Carl Vinson strike group.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Serbia warns of another Balkan War

Serbian officials warned of another war in the Balkans, an infamous historical flashpoint for human conflict, if Albania moves forward with moves to create a ‘super-Albanian’ state for Muslims on the Balkan Peninsula, namely Kosovo. Serbia fought a war with Islamic members of Kosovo in the ‘90s who wanted to secede from greater Serbia and form their own state. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, bombed Serbian forces to prevent the genocide that was happening during the conflict and to force peace. Serbia’s Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist turned pro-EU reformer, said that the unification between Albania and Kosovo “will remain only wishful thinking” and called on the EU to react. “If I said that all Serbs should live in one state, I would be hanged from a flagpole in Brussels,” Vucic said, The Associated Press reported. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said an interview with Politico journal that a union between Albania and ethnic Albanian-dominated Kosovo cannot be ruled out if European Union membership prospects for the Western Balkans do not materialize. Serbian government minister Aleksandar Vulin publicly stated he expected the European Union and NATO to forcibly renounce such statements to prevent another Balkan conflict. Vulin said that another war in the region would include Macedonia and Montenegro which have large ethnic-Albanian populations. This would force Serbia to align with the smaller ethnic Serbian country, Bosnia. World War I was started in the Balkans with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

With U.S. distracted, Russia warms to opportunities in ‘frozen conflicts’
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION With the Trump administration focused on other hot spots of the world, from Iran and Syria to North Korea, Russia is stealthily making carefully coordinated moves to bring several “frozen” conflict zones closer to the Motherland. Transdniester, a part of the tiny former Soviet republic of Moldova lodged between Ukraine and Romania, has long had the “honor” of hosting lots of Russian troops (since the early 1990s) and essentially has become a territory of the Russian Federation. The Kremlin seems to be using this model for other regions where Moscow has had to “protect” Russian speakers living in lands beyond its present borders. The most recent examples of this phenomenon are the two occupied, former territories of Georgia in the Caucasus. I’m speaking of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, both “reaccommodated” from Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War of 2008. There have been multiple actions in these areas that make it obvious Russia is making plans to eventually fully bring them under Kremlin control. There have been several border closures in the recent months — for instance during elections that were held in South Ossetia, which included a proposal to change the name of the region to the state of “Alania.” The Georgian government protested vigorously against these measures, of course, and NATO condemned the elections as illegitimate. Three Georgian citizens were recently taken into custody in South Ossetia as they were attempting to visit the graves of their relatives during Easter holidays. Over 30,000 Georgians were evicted from their homes during the war and are restricted from taking care of their loved one’s resting place. In another overt gesture, Russian Foreign Secretary Sergey Lavrov recently paid a visit to the other occupied Georgian territory, Abkhazia, during which he opened a Russian embassy in the state, which is only recognized by Russia and a few other nations, like Venezuela and Nicaragua. “When we speak about diplomats, embassies are like the second home for us. So I would like to congratulate all our diplomats and the Russian Foreign Ministry on the opening of the new building of our embassy in the Republic of Abkhazia,” Mr. Lavrov said during the ceremony. “I am confident that the embassy will be the second home not only for our diplomats but also for our Abkhazian friends, as well as for friends from the diplomatic corps.” Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree earlier in the year which brought several of the best military units in the disputed territories under the control of the Russian armed forces. Other troops were disbanded and disarmed. In eastern Ukraine, there have been repeated attempts to also legitimize Russian control over the Donbass region controlled by pro-Russian separatists battling Kiev. Russia has begun to accept formal, government-issued documents from the Luhansk and Donetsk “People’s Republics” as valid documents for marriage certificates, passports and other functions. Moscow is laying the groundwork for use of the ruble and the legal tender in the disputed areas of Ukraine. All of these moves have happened as the Minsk agreements, signed by Russia, Ukraine and several Western powers, have yet to be implemented and now look impossible to see put into place. It is obvious Moscow has been financially supporting its allies in eastern Ukraine for some time. Perhaps the Kremlin has decided to make permanent the status of the frozen conflicts, at a time when the West seems powerless to stop them. Sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea do not look to be lifted soon either. Moscow may have decided it has nothing to lose by pulling these areas closer to Mother Russia. ⦁ L.

North Korea won’t talk to China

As tensions rise over the North Korean nuclear program and its aggressive behavior toward the United States and its allies, the leader of the communist regime, Kim Jong-un, is not even talking to his long-term benefactor, China.  This may be the reason that President Trump and Chinese President Xi got along so famously with each other at their meeting a Mar-a-Lago recently in Florida, and maybe one reason why China seems to be working with Mr. Trump to dampen the North Korean threat. China has made recent requests for its diplomatic officials to meet with their counterparts in the North, including the Chinese foreign minister; however, these requests were denied.   In addition, China’s special envoy for the North Korean nuclear issue, Wu Dawei, was also refused a response to his meeting request, reported Bloomberg, naming an unidentified source. In the last few weeks, China has refused coal shipments from North Korea and has made public comments regarding its unhappiness with Kim Jong-un’s policies.  President Trump has said he would like China to deal with the issue but if they cannot or will not, America ‘will take care of the problem. President Trump and President Xi have also made public their many recent phone conversations which they described as fruitful and that progress was made.  In all likelihood, it seems that the hermit leader of the North cannot back down as the personal consequence for losing power is most likely death. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Russia undermining U.S. in Afghanistan by supporting Taliban
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: While the United States has been distracted by the 2016 election and the political upheaval that followed, Russia has been quietly aiding and abetting America’s enemy in her longest war, the Taliban in Afghanistan. After the disastrous term of Barack Obama, United States policy in the region foundered, like an ancient ship on the rocks.  Russia has taken advantage and the Pentagon is worried.  President Trump has a lot on his plate but he has to make room for Afghanistan. Russia has “begun to publicly legitimize the Taliban,” and recent Russian and Iranian actions in Afghanistan “are to undermine the United States and NATO,” the top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson Jr., said in Senate testimony in February, reported the Washington Post. Russia most likely wants to exact some type of karma for the defeat of Soviet forces by Afghan mujahadeen during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1970s.  The CIA supplied sophisticated arms to the Islamic fighters who eventually aligned with Osama Bin Laden after America abandoned the region after the Soviets withdrew. Evidence is emerging of Russian and Taliban high-level contacts and possible armaments like shoulder-fired RPGs and night-vision equipment. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

‘Old Europe’ sinks under the weight of secular progressivism
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: This week the existential problems facing the European Union came into stark relief as Belgium threatened Poland and Hungary with legal action if they did not agree to commit cultural suicide by letting in hundreds of thousands of “refugees” from the Middle East. This comes on the heels of Facebook-livestreamed rapes in Sweden, truck attacks in France and other Western European capitals, and jihadist bombs targeting the buses of famous soccer teams in Germany. This is not normal; it’s not acceptable; and the EU bureaucrats’ indignation is severely misplaced. “If member-states do not increase their relocations soon, the Commission will not hesitate to make use of its powers  for those which have not complied,” the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement aimed at Budapest, Warsaw and other restive East European capitals. The EU’s eastern members are more conservative and more religious — Christian, that is — than the countries in the west, as “old Europe” sinks under the weight of secular progressivism. The easterners value their heritage and their culture. They don’t want thousands of mosques built while churches close. They don’t want the violence that is inherent with letting these migrants in. They don’t want the cost. They don’t want the terrorism. This is not racist. It’s simple self-preservation. Nowhere in the annals of Western democracy does it say a nation must commit seppuku in order to meet some culturally Marxist ideal. It didn’t say that in the Magna Carta, the U.S. Constitution, or the foundation documents of the European Union. If Brussels keeps pushing its ultimatum, the Union will break apart. This was one of the main reasons behind Brexit, but the globalists in Brussels, living in their guarded lakeside chalets, either don’t understand or they don’t care. Yes, Russia is aiding and abetting the East Europeans’ resistance, perhaps hoping to help these former Soviet satellites see their way back to Moscow’s influence. However, the Kremlin is just jumping on the gift horse the European Union has given it. And why wouldn’t Russia do this? The West would do the same thing if given the chance. The EU and Hungary are also at loggerheads over Budapest’s measures against a university opened by American liberal billionaire George Soros in Budapest after the fall of the Soviet Union. Mr. Soros has been active in undermining governments, pushing open borders and legalizing drug use across Eastern Europe. His large bank account has funded a plethora of NGOs and other entities pushing his agenda. His influence extended to the Obama State Department, and U.S. diplomats were actively taking measures against certain governments and political parties in Eastern Europe that do not follow, or propagate, the progressive line. Governments in Albania and elsewhere are accused of turning a blind eye to the drug trade or worse, being complicit in pushing opioids and other drugs on their citizens. In essence, the U.S. government has been aiding and abetting the opioid epidemic in Europe, through its questionable decision to support Mr. Soros’ initiatives. Anti-Russian hysteria has reached full force in the West, but what’s been overlooked how liberal globalists are using that hysteria to shirk accountability for their own actions and policies. Why take responsibility for the consequences of your agenda when you can yell, “The Russians are coming!” There’s no excusing Russian interference in Western democratic institutions, but there’s also no way to justify the globalists refuse to acknowledge and refuse to correct the horror, terror and cultural dislocation they have put their populations through. Russia doesn’t need to expend treasure to topple the European Union. The EU is doing a fine job all on its own. • L.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte offers to sell disputed islands to China 
.B
Erratic Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte offered to sell disputed islands in the South China Sea, a move certain to alarm American military leaders.  He made the comments Tuesday and the remarks seem to have been intended to relieve Chinese anger over the Philippines stationing military personnel and infrastructure on land both countries claim. “We do not mean harm to China. We are friends, as a matter of fact. Maybe when we get rich, very rich, I can sell the land to you for—inyo na when the spectacle of a war is gone and nothing is dangerous to the Philippines,” reported GMA News Online. “So, for the information of China, we are not going to place there any offensive weapons, not even one gun. We are just there to claim the island for us because that is really ours,” Duterte said.  “And I have ordered the Armed Forces to build structures there to signify to all na atin ito ang lagyan ng flag and structures. We do not mean harm to China. We are friends.” “China can relax. We are friends. We will not go to war with you. We’re just trying to maintain the balance of the geopolitical situation there.” Last year, the Philippines won an a verdict at a U.N. tribunal over the issue, which China declared they would ignore.  China has militarized many of the man-made islands in an attempt to control international sea lanes in the region. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Russia won’t intercept U.S. missile strikes 
.B
The Russian government said today that it will not shoot down further U.S. missile strikes against Syrian targets; however, they left open the possibility for Syrian anti-aircraft forces to do so.The head of the Russian Federation Council’s Defense and Security Committee says Russian armed forces based in Syria, Senator Viktor Ozerov, told the news agency Interfax, “Our armed forces are in Syria to fight terrorism — not to defend against external threats. That’s not our mandate, and we’re not going to intercept anything.”  He added that Syria has every right to attempt to do so, reported The Moscow Times.It has been reported that Russia is beefing up the Syrian air defense network with state of the art S-300, and S-400 systems that Russia has on the ground in-country already protecting Russian air bases and troops.  It is possible that any Syrian system could actually employ Russian operators as the Soviet Union did in the past in the Korean War, as well as Vietnam.  However, that seems like a big risk to take of a U.S. strike actually hitting Russian forces on the ground.  Moscow could also very likely used mercenary troops as they have in Syria and East Ukraine, which gives them plausible deniability of Russian forces in theater.

Trump’s brilliant move turns tables on Putin and the world
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Donald Trump has told us he likes to be unpredictable.  This art of the deal was on full display Thursday evening in Syria. I have been writing for some time now about how Trump out thinks and out plans his rivals.  He is a master chess player on the geopolitical stage, rivaling, or surpassing, the KGB spymaster, Putin.  He prepares the battlefield before fighting.  By the time he gets to the negotiation table, the deal is already done. Vladimir Putin has needed an enemy to focus his people’s ire, to take their minds off their economic problems.  This enemy, for the last decade, has been the United States.  Enter Donald Trump, stage right. Trump has been talking about working with Russia for two years.  He has been offering an olive branch, saying “nice things” about Putin, to the derision of the Left and the Obama media.  He has taken the arrows, and kept pressing, not reversing his course of wanting to have better relations with Russia, in spite of Chris Wallace and others making fun of him on their Sunday morning shows. Now we know why. Russia has been taking advantage of the lack of leadership in the Middle East under Barack Obama.  They have pushed and pushed and pushed.  The Kremlin secured a nuclear deal for Iran and are now the recipient of billions in weapons sales.  Moscow has established a permanent beachhead in Syria.  Even Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has flown to visit Putin in Moscow several times, needing a friend after he lost trust in the United States under Hussein. Now Trump has taken decisive action that most likely caught the Kremlin off guard.  How can Putin credibly blame the U.S. after Trump has made nice for all this time?  How can Trump be the enemy when the Kremlin was ecstatic he won over Hillary? The narrative coming out of Russia now on the chemical weapons story is not believable.  How can Trump be lying when he was made out by Russian state media to be the anti-Obama? In one brilliant stroke, Trump put Assad on notice, called out Russia’s support of this barbarism in a very public way, and frightened Iran, North Korea and China at the same time.  Trump also drove a stake in the heart of the “Trump’s a Putin puppet” narrative. And oh yeah, he made Assad pay a price for using chemical weapons, which only enhances American security long term.  This is not about the U.S. trying to get involved in Syria.  It is strictly about using weapons of mass destruction, which  are still very dangerous, which are an existential threat to the United States. The world is going through an adjustment period.  We are moving from a time when the United States was adrift, having lost its focus and intentionally weakened by its former president.  It will take the world some time to get used to the new reality. America is back.  She is once again led by a credible, effective leader who will unflinchingly stand up for America’s people and her security.  This is a good thing but will take the dictators of the world some time to get used to. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

South Korea badly in need of a little Trump attention
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: There’s been a lot going on in recent weeks with the Stalinist regime of North Korea and its quest for a nuclear arsenal to threaten the world. It is obvious the Trump administration intends finally to stop talking and start doing something about this festering geopolitical sore. As Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said this week after the latest North Korean missile test, “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.” President Trump, who is talking about the crisis on the peninsula with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, summed up his expectations for Beijing thusly: “China will either decide to help us with North Korea or they won’t. … If they do, that will be very good for China, and if they don’t, it won’t be good for anyone.” Mr. Trump has also heavily focused on assuring Japan of America’s commitment to its allies in the region. The president played golf, twice, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and made sure the world saw a robust Japanese-American relationship. This greatly reassured the Japanese public that their American ally was still to be trusted. However, you get a gold star if you can figure out the one critical ally that the Trump administration has so far reassured about the solidity of the bilateral relationship. In fact, no American ambassador has been named yet and this longtime friend will not be privy to this week’s talks between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Yes, I’m talking about that other Korea, the Republic of Korea. That would be South Korea — you know, the country whom we fought a war to preserve and a land where tens of thousands of Americans died in a war with North Korea that, technically, still hasn’t ended. Yes, the United States is deploying the THAAD missile defense system in the South. However, this is a long-range, high altitude defense against ballistic missiles. This system is more likely designed to protect Japan and American assets in the region, such as Guam and other American outposts. By contrast, the immediate threat to the South, and Seoul in particular, is artillery from just across the DMZ. There are thousands of North Korean artillery tubes embedded in the mountains only a few miles from the South Korean capital. The North routinely has advertised its intention to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire” if war breaks out again. The South has paid a price for agreeing to host THAAD on its territory. China really doesn’t like it, worried about a U.S. missile defense program in the same way the Soviets once did. Infuriated by THAAD, the Chinese are targeting South Korean economic interests such as tourism, where package deals to the South have been banned. South Koreans in China have been assaulted and South Korean businesses boycotted. The communist government insists these events are just ordinary Chinese citizens expressing their anger, but obviously the violence is state-inspired. So the South Koreans wonder: Why are we not being included in the debate when we are paying a price for standing up to Beijing and Pyongyang? Why hasn’t a U.S. ambassador been appointed to one of its critical friends in the region? There is also the historical animosity between Koreans and the Japanese that dates back to WWII (and before) that must be taken into account. Perceptions in this debate are extremely important. When Seoul sees the Trump administration paying extra attention to Japanese security and the relationship with the Japanese prime minister, it has knock-on effects back home. South Korea would like the U.S. to pressure China to end its economic pressure campaign. They would like to be included in the regional discussions about their future. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. will “go it alone” if need be regarding the North Korean threat, and his outreach to Japan have plainly worried the South. This is most likely just the result of the new Trump administration getting its geopolitical sea legs. However, it is a slight that needs to be rectified. • L.

The outer islands of the Philippines have long been hotbeds for insurgencies, especially the communist type. Back in the days of the American installations of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, the island of Mindanao was always talked about in terms of communist rebellion and training of fighters. Now it seems the isolated areas could become popular for the training and recruitment of ISIS fighters as well, the new scourge of the modern age.“Currently, IS is moving towards creating a territory in the southern Philippines. The most recent communication issued by IS has announced that they have formally declared an East Asia division of IS in the southern Philippines,” Singaporean counter-terrorism analyst Rohan Gunaratna said at a security conference in Singapore. “Our forecast for 2017 is that the threat in this region will grow because of the creation of an IS nucleus in the southern Philippines,” reported Newsweek.Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, said the southern majority-Muslim region of Mindanao was “becoming an area that is difficult to control despite the best efforts of the Philippine government.” The region could serve as a “sanctuary for returning fighters from the Middle East,” he warned.In addition to killing drug dealers, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has declared war on the Islamic insurgency brewing in Mindanao, particularly the group calling themselves Aby Sayyaf. The ISIS-linked militants recently beheaded a German national who had been held captive for some time. The group is located in the Sulu region of Mindanao.

World leaders worry Trump might solve N. Korea problem
.B
It seems the world outside of the United States is becoming worried that newly minted President Donald Trump just might actually solve the North Korean problem on his own. Global leaders from Chinese President Xi to British Prime Minister May have voiced their displeasure at President Trump’s claim that if China doesn’t solve the North Korean problem, the United States would.  The prospect of an American leader actually taking care of American security seems too much for the globalist world to take. After eight years of bowing, appeasing and retreating, having an alpha male in the White House, and one that gets results at that, is just plain frightening.  Having more “discussions” in the United Nations Security Council seems to be the globalist preferred route.For Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May acted this way, “I think what is crucial - and where we have been working, and will continue to work through the United Nations Security Council, through resolutions which we have supported there, and with the United States - is to encourage China to look at this issue of North Korea and to play a more significant role in terms of North Korea,” she said.  “I think that’s where our attention should focus,” reported The Telegraph. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said this on the Sunday news circuit,  a war with North Korea would lead to “an intensity of violence” not seen since the Korean War.  That may be true.  However, former CIA chief James Woolsey recently stated that one single EMP nuclear weapon expended in an air burst over the United States would completely wipe out the American power grid and kill up to 90 percent of Americans through starvation. I guess our former globalist leaders would prefer that ‘intensity of violence’ over actually dealing with the North Korean threat.  The liberal narrative is that Trump is not credible and the comments should be ignored.  However, behind closed doors, they worry he is really way too credible for their liking.

.T
Ukrainian corruption casts nuclear pall over Europe
.B
In 2016, the No. 1 tourist destination of Ukraine was the lifeless town of Pripyat, evacuated after the deadly reactor meltdown at Chernobyl in 1986. Today, Ukraine relies on nuclear power for 53 percent of its power generation, but is risking another nuclear accident on a scale greater than Europe — and the world — could imagine. The problems facing Ukraine’s nuclear power industry are multi-faceted, but the main issue is the same one plaguing the whole of the former Soviet republic — corruption, which is breeding a lack of accountability and mismanagement of the sector’s critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s nuclear power plants are supposed to be regulated by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), which by law is an independent regulatory body. In recent years, however, it has become standard practice for the leaders of SNRIU to be appointed by the state nuclear power plant operator, Energoatom, instead of through a rigorous, independent selection process. This, perversely, subjugates the regulator to the whims of the operator. If Energoatom cannot meet certain safety standards or deadlines, its bosses simply inform the regulator of such, and the deadlines are extended or eliminated, public safety be damned. In addition, many positions at the regulatory body remain empty. For example, the position of the chief state inspector of nuclear and radiation safety has been vacant for three years. Other key posts of the Ukrainian nuclear regulator remain vacant. It gets worse. Operating in such a permissive environment, Energoatom no longer feels any pressure to observe the best domestic regulatory or international practices in its procurement operations. Instead of adhering to the procedures of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and hiring companies with a proven track record, Energoatom started using dubious firms that do not possess the necessary experience and expertise to do work. International inspections are pro forma and only carried out infrequently. All this corruption has led to extremely dangerous decisions putting the safety of Ukrainians and people across Europe at great risk. For example, the life spans of two units of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, were extended, while seismic safety measures were ignored. An inspection found that the emergency diesel generators, which are responsible for cooling the reactors in the event of a power loss, were virtually incapable of doing so. Failed standby generators were the cause of the meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima plant after the tsunami destroyed the electric grid support for the reactor. There is a geopolitical twist to this story. The West has been pushing the Japanese-owned Westinghouse as an alternative source to Russian nuclear fuel for Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe. This is being done not for safety or market reasons, as often stated, but to damage Russian interests in the region. However, there is a problem: The reactors using a combination of Russian and Western fuel had to be shut down about almost every month due to safety concerns. The Westinghouse product is simply not as good as the Russian fuel made for the Russian-designed reactors, creating a highly dangerous situation where the reactor could fail. In addition, parent company Toshiba has announced that Westinghouse, its money-losing U.S. subsidiary, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That filing brings into question the long-term viability of Westinghouse’s fuel supply to Ukrainian reactors. The original manufacturers have advised they will not take responsibility for Ukraine going against their advice and using another fuel supplier. This may be a Chernobyl waiting to happen. Unfortunately, the procurement process has also succumbed to time-tested, Soviet-legacy corruption methods. The Ukrainian anti-corruption agency, NOBU, recently uncovered bribes paid by the Czech company Skoda JS to officials at Energoatom. Illegal withdrawals of public funds for cable products, working with offshore companies that sponsor terrorism worldwide, and overpayments by Energoatom of hundreds of millions of UAH, have all been uncovered by Ukrainian anti-corruption officials. One would hope that Kiev will soon realize that the nuclear industry is not only a risk to the country’s energy security, but also that the country’s overall  security cannot be ensured without a fully independent and functioning nuclear regulator. This is bigger than just Ukraine alone. The future of Europe is at stake. ⦁ L.

China fortification of South China Sea nears completion
.B
Images taken by the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) earlier this month provide evidence that the fortification of the South China Sea islands claimed by the Chinese government as sovereign Chinese territory is nearing completion.  The photos show large aircraft hangars, missile batteries, and radar facilities nearing completion.  The three main islands which show this militarization are Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs, all of the Spratly Islands chain. The hangars built can protect up to 24 fighter jets, bomber or reconnaissance aircraft.  “I mean, you don’t build facilities like that and then not use them,” Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Yusof Ishak Institute, told CNN. “Whether we decide to deploy or not deploy relevant military equipment, it is within our scope of sovereignty. It’s our right to self-defense and self-preservation as recognized by international law,” said Hua Chunying from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “China’s three military bases in the Spratlys and another on Woody Island in the Paracels will allow Chinese military aircraft to operate over nearly the entire South China Sea,” AMTI said in a statement. The United States and its allies in the region fear that China will eventually declare an air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, in the area, preventing adversarial military forces from entering the region.  The U.S. in particular has said it will not allow this to happen, that the area is in international waters, and the U.S. Navy will continue freedom of navigation transit and flights through the area.

N. Korea using hackers to rob banks to fund regime
.B
It is estimated North Korea has a hacker army numbered in the thousands.  The regime is becoming increasingly bold in its quest for foreign currency and is using this hacker army to attack banks around the world and steal money, lots of money. The targets of this illicit campaign have steadily become more formidable, showing the confidence the cyber force has in their anonymity and their ability to defeat even the largest financial institutions in the United States and around the world. According to the New York Times, targets have included the World Bank, the European Central Bank, and big U.S. companies, including Bank of America, State Street Bank and Trust, and the Bank of New York Mellon. North Korean hackers have recently tried to break into Polish banks and investigators gleaned from that attempt the regime’s desire to hit over 100 financial institutions around the world.  Two successful attempts include the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh and the hack of Sony pictures. “We found multiple links, which gave us reasonable confidence that it’s the same group behind Bangladesh as the Polish attacks,” said Eric Chien, a researcher at Symantec, which studied both attacks, again reported the New York Times. The hacker army typically lives abroad in China, Southeast Asia and Europe to take advantage of the outside world’s Internet infrastructure, which is minimal at best at home. They are constantly monitored for defection. The cyber force is also used to spread disinformation, or “fake news,” and to prevent real news about the hermit kingdom from getting released. They also attack the regime’s perceived enemies with harmful propaganda and data theft. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

London reveals — again — the poverty of the globalist vision
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: As we once again see the multiculturalists in London do the things globalists do after their friends and countrymen get slaughtered — light candles and offer up thoughts and prayers — it may be worth coming up for air and taking a hard look at where Western society is as a growing concern. The first thing we should realize is that the European Union is breaking apart. Historians will look back on 2016 as the tipping point, the year Donald Trump was elected, the year Brexit went through, the year more populist leaders came to the fore and the year Eastern Europe started to turn away from Brussels. Poland is in open warfare against European Union Council Chairman Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who was just accused of treason by his own country. The new government in Warsaw is enraged that Mr. Tusk was re-elected as head of the council, since they perceive him as attempting to delegitimize nothing less than Polish sovereignty. Hungary is enraged at Brussels and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for attempting to stop Prime Minister Viktor Orban from shoring up his own borders, for attempting to prevent the unleashing of hordes of refugees on his own people. By the way, Hungary is now building a big, beautiful, double-barrier, electrified wall, complete with a force of “Border Hunters,” and — guess what? — it’s working. French nationalism is on the rise. Sweden no longer exists as we knew her. (Mr. Trump was right again on that one, by the way). Germany is irrevocably changed — its culture extinguished by unchecked immigration. Turkey is now actively pushing its own politics into countries throughout Europe, backed by growing Muslim populations in a string of European capitals. The second Ottoman invasion of Europe is almost complete. The globalists, forever bowing to the god of mindless generosity and the agenda of open borders, free drugs and the destruction of the Christian religion, refuse to stand up for the rights of their own people. If ordinary Europeans want to live in freedom and security, they will have to take matters into their own hands. Most likely, it is too late. The damage has been done. For, you see, globalists don’t care. They’ve got their corporations, their hedge funds, their offshore accounts in the Channel Islands and elsewhere. The fight for freedom really has morphed from one between capitalists and communists to between a clash between globalists and nationalists, between those who have no loyalties and those who treasure the safety and security of their own country. Yes, Vladimir Putin saw this coming. And yes, the Kremlin has gone along for the ride, fanning the flames of the inevitable nationalism that comes from seeing a loved one butchered by another tribe. The blame for Brexit doesn’t fall on Moscow. The blame for Mr. Trump doesn’t fall on Moscow, either. The blame for the future populist leaders who will be elected in Europe won’t fall on Moscow. You can be a nationalist and an American patriot without being a pro-Russian flunky, no matter what the corrupt mainstream media try to tell you. The blame for the breakup of the European Union lies at the feet of those very globalist leaders who let down their people. It lies with those who put the religion of cultural Marxism above their own citizen’s safety. It lies with those in Europe and America who don’t believe that their culture and the future of their children are worth saving. It lies with the willful denial of the “progressives” who are inexorably killing their own people for some magical fulfillment that will never come from Islam or from any other secular god. • L.

Globalist media trying to twist Putin-Russian agenda their way
.B
I received a tweet the other day that was blocked, informing me that  the material was “possible insensitive and offensive.”  After clicking  to unmask the tweet, the supposedly dangerous content read, “It’s no  longer capitalist versus communist, It’s nationalist versus globalist.” This  was just one example of many where the Left-wing, “progressive” media  apparatus is attempting to brand anyone opposed to their agenda as “In  Putin’s pocket.”  The latest broadside in this increasingly coordinated  and aggressive campaign from our Marxist mainstream propaganda outlets  was a piece this morning in Politico. The article starts with  this— As Lee and other senators put it in a March 14 letter to Secretary  of State Rex Tillerson, Soros’ Open Society Foundations are trying “to  push a progressive agenda and invigorate the political left.”  The piece  goes on to basically say the entire thing is engineered by Russia and  nationalist politicians like Lee, Trump, or Cruz are simply puppets for  the Kremlin and doing Moscow’s bidding. This narrative is  dangerous if not confronted as nothing could be further from the truth.   The facts are Soros has been pushing a Marxist, globalist agenda in  Eastern Europe as well as here in these United States.  American  ambassadors, appointed by and doing Obama’s bidding, have overstepped  their bounds, picking one side of the other in a sovereign nation.  They  have done this by cancelling visas of the opposition in once case in  Albania.  Of course, liberals always point to the ends justify the means  for this type of improper behavior. For Politico, the Soros  agenda is all puppies and ice cream, open societies and all.  They  mention nothing about the destruction of Europe’s culture and security  by the massive migration that Soros has championed.  As terror attacks  unfold in London, they willfully ignore the consequences of Soros’  actions.  They also mention nothing about the thousands of deaths caused  by the drug trade that Mr. Soros supports by pushing legalization.  In  fact, in Albania, where the Soros- and Obama-backed American ambassador  sided with the leftist government, the regime has been accused of  running the lucrative drug trade in-country. Politico goes on  to denigrate news outlets that don’t push their narrative, such as Fox  and Alex Jones, using the words conspiracy, right-wing, and so on. The  fact is it is ok to be an American nationalist.  It is ok to want  secure borders.  It is OK to want a State Department that doesn’t push a  cultural Marxist agenda.  It is OK to want to prevent your tax dollars  from being used overseas to push the Leftist cause. This  doesn’t make you a Russian puppet.  It doesn’t put you in Putin’s  pocket, anymore than liberals who wanted government-run healthcare  during Soviet times put them in Brezhnev’s pocket. Yes, the end  goal of getting Mr. Soros off the international stage my align with the  Kremlin’s but that doesn’t make nationalist Americans traitors. The  simple fact is, the fight is now between globalists who want to destroy  America as we knew her and those who want to fight for our national  identity.  That is not offensive or insensitive content.  It is the  truth. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Russia to train YPG Kurds in northern Syria
.B
Russia continues to expand its influence in the Middle Eastern region, especially in what remains of the Syrian state. Today, parts of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, along the Turkish border have declared they will be trained by Russian troops.  “An agreement was signed between our units and Russian forces operating in Syria that will train us in modern military tactics,” YPG spokesman Redur Xelil said, reported AFP. “This is the first agreement of its kind, although we have had previous cooperation (with the Russians) in Aleppo city.” Turkey considers the Kurds and the YPG “terrorist” groups.  Russia seems to be walking a fine balancing act between making friends with Turkey, to pull them away from NATO’s orbit, and in assisting Turkey’s sworn enemies.  The United States military, which assists certain YPG fighters who engage the Islamic State, says the units Russia will be training are not those American supports. As the Islamic State recedes from northern Syria and Iraq, the Kurds are becoming more influential in the region. This trend is the most likely reason Russia wants to get involved, to attempt to dictate what happens on the Turkish border and in any new Kurdish territory that might arise.  Russian President Vladimir Putin is showing now sign of making the same mistake President Obama did after American forces won the battles of the 2nd Gulf Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, by staying engaged in the area and attempting to influence future events and alliances.

From North Korea, a Dr. Evil update

The North Korean News Agency announced Sunday morning that the communist regime had ground tested a new high-powered, high-thrust rocket engine to be used to launch satellites into orbit.  The North’s “Dear Leader,” Kim Jong-un, said the test was a ‘great, revolutionary victory’ for the country and its space program.  The test was conducted at the Sohae launch site and meant to gauge the thrust power, and the safety and control features of the new engine design.  North Korea is prohibited by the U.N. from testing ballistic missiles but space research is acceptable under international sanctions.  The regime declares it will place navigation and other systems into orbit and eventually make a shot for the Moon.KCNA reported Kim called the test “a great event of historic significance” for the country’s indigenous rocket industry, wrote the Associated Press.  He added, the “whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries” and claimed the test marks what will be known as the “March 18 revolution” for the regime’s space efforts.  American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in Asia meeting with the Chinese and U.S. allies and this test was obviously meant to show that the North will continue to develop a nuclear ICBM capability and has not been deterred by any Western actions to date.  Tillerson famously commented recently that, “The era of strategic patience is over.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

U.S. strike on Syria ends hopes of new era with Russia
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION The U.S. missile strike on Syrian territory spells the end of a long and strange period of speculation, of hopes for a new era of U.S.-Russian relations, of prospects for a “major deal” between the two countries and, in general, of any possibility that President Trump is, as alleged, a “pro-Russian” leader. Incidentally, it is amazing how that allegation — that the Hillary Clinton campaign created but failed to translate into an election victory — has since taken on a life of its own and become a political factor not only in the U.S., but even in Russia. Given the way Mr. Trump constantly referred to himself as an unsurpassed “master of the deal” with long years of business experience, it was only natural to anticipate that Washington would try to strike some sort of “major deal” with Moscow. The buzz about such an agreement began with Mr. Trump’s election in November and continued until February, when it became clear that no “special” relations between the two countries were in the offing. In theory, had Mr. Trump taken the nontraditional step of meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin before or immediately after his inauguration, it might have altered the entrenched thinking and opened a window of opportunity for improved relations. Though providing no guarantees, it would have created a chance to use this atmosphere of mutual interests between the two leaders. When that did not happen, institutional inertia kicked in. What’s more, with Russia now a major point of contention in U.S. politics, the Trump administration finds that its hands are tied for improving relations with Moscow, even if it wanted to. However, even if Messrs. Trump and Putin had met early on, it is unlikely any deal would have resulted. In fact, certain factors make such an agreement almost impossible, regardless of who sits in the White House and Kremlin. The first and most all-encompassing reason is that the 21st century is not the time for major powers to conclude pacts determining the fate of smaller states. The big players are unable to impose their will on even the most fragile and failing states, much less on those that function more or less normally. The great powers simply lack any leverage over a world that has grown far more diversified. The Yalta Conference and Congress of Vienna were held in the aftermath of major wars that left no doubt as to who was in control. Any modern attempt at such a deal would run up against the reality of a world whose affairs are now very nebulous — and likely to remain so. Second, the history of U.S. relations with other states — and not only with Russia — convincingly proves one thing: that Washington almost never concludes deals on equal terms, but always from a position of strength. The arrangements made following World War II were unique in that an absolute balance of power existed for what, in historical terms, was a very short period. Nothing like that is possible now, meaning that Messrs. Trump and Putin will not strike any “major deal.” Third, any hypothetical deal between Moscow and Washington would come at the expense of both countries’ other foreign policy interests. Does it make sense for Russia to place limits on its relations with China and Iran — both of which are strategically important to Moscow over the long term — in order to conclude certain agreements with the United States? Should Washington send its European and Asian allies into a frenzy, knowing that they bristle at even the mention of a U.S.-Russian deal? Of course not, especially because any such arrangement would necessarily be situational and short-lived, as the whole history of their mutual relations shows. In a sense, the recent developments in Syria actually bring some clarity to the situation by underscoring that no such deal is in the works and that the “game” between the major powers will now resume with renewed vigor. In the past couple of months, the decision by the United States to absent itself from the region created the impression that it would be possible to resolve the Syrian crisis without Washington. Now it seems that the United States under Mr. Trump wants to play a decisive role, although toward which end remains even more unclear now than it was under former President Barack Obama. And, of course, the United States and all the other outside players in the crisis care more about their own interests than they do about the fate of Syria itself. From this point onward, U.S.-Russia relations could go in a variety of directions, up to and including a sharp escalation in tensions and a military clash in Syria. For now, though, it looks as though neither side wants that. In a best-case scenario, the Trump administration would take this opportunity to express a desire for serious interaction with Russia on Syria. There is a certain logic in this. After all, prior to the missile strikes, the U.S. operated from a position of weakness, as a country that had relinquished its initiative in the region. Now Washington can take a more proactive stance, something Mr. Trump needs both as a leader and as a would-be negotiator on Syria. For now, Russia should wait to ascertain Washington’s real intentions — that is, if it has actually formulated any. ⦁ Fyodor Lukyanov is research director of the Valdai Discussion Club and chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy.

Forget grand U.S.-Russia bargain
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION What’s a grand bargain? Since Donald Trump’s election last November, there has been much speculation about a U.S.-Russia grand bargain, although it has faded dramatically in recent weeks amid far-reaching U.S. investigations of Russian interference in U.S. elections last year and possible collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Kremlin. It was never clear, however, what the content of a grand bargain would be.In Russia, the hope appeared to be that Washington would accept Moscow’s views on the Syria and Ukraine crises and lift the Ukraine sanctions in exchange for Moscow’s cooperation against Islamic State in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. That was precisely what many in Washington feared. Such a deal was never really in the cards. Few in Washington believe that Russia is intent on fighting Islamic State. Its military operations appear more focused on supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad against U.S.-backed moderate opponents with legitimate grievances against his brutal regime. The U.S. military and intelligence services, deeply distrustful of their Russian counterparts, would have pushed back aggressively against any White House plan to deepen cooperation. Meanwhile, the Ukraine crisis concerns much more than the fate of the Donbas. At stake are the fundamental principles of European security and world order, disagreements over which cannot be swept away with a presidential handshake. Moreover, even a deal on Syria and Ukraine would have left much of great import and contention unresolved in U.S.-Russian relations. The hard truth is that divisions between the two countries are deeper now than they have been since the later stages of the Cold War. They involve questions of world order, strategic stability, regional conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia — and values. The two countries espouse sharply different interpretations of sovereignty and self-determination, as demonstrated by the U.S. and Russian approaches to Kosovo and Crimea. They diverge on when the use of force is legitimate: Look at U.S. condemnation of Russian military action against Georgia in 2008 and Russian questions about NATO operations in Libya in 2011. Russia claims a sphere of privileged interests in the former Soviet space, which the United States categorically rejects. Similarly, Russia and the United States trade accusations over which side has violated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and argue over the implications of the U.S. missile defense system and conventional strike forces for strategic stability. To Ukraine and Syria, add opposing positions on other conflicts in the Middle East and approaches to Iran’s and North Korea’s nuclear programs that are out of sync, even if both countries endorsed the Iran nuclear deal and support sanctions against North Korea. The ideological divide might not be as great as during the Cold War, but the two countries do not share a commitment to democratic values, and each side interferes in the domestic affairs of the other, even as it insists it does not. There is no easy resolution to these outstanding problems, and certainly no truly grand bargain that would resolve most, if not all, of them. The best that can be hoped for is a mutual commitment to manage the differences in a way that avoids falling into a confrontation that would benefit neither side and risk catastrophic damage given each side’s arsenal of nuclear, cyber and advanced conventional weapons. At a time of deep acrimony, what is now called for are small steps. At the top of the list is reopening the channels of communication that were shut down with the eruption of the Ukraine crisis three years ago. Russia and the United States need to be engaged in constant discussion of the contentious issues between them to better understand each other’s interests, perspectives and goals so that they do not misread the other side and overreact at a time of crisis or mistake an accident for a deliberate attempt to harm. Eventually, these discussions might lead to deals, to the resolution of one or another problem or identify important areas for cooperation, but that will take time. Each side could improve the atmosphere for such discussions by ratcheting down the hostile rhetoric about the other side. That would carry benefits not only for U.S.-Russian relations but for the domestic situation in each country. The demonization of the other side deflects attention from the hard truth that the main domestic problems each country confronts are largely home-grown and aggravated by poor policy. They are not the work of some dark conspiracy by the other side. In short, forget about grand bargains. Small steps are the order of the day in U.S.-Russian relations. The sooner the two sides get on with the hard work at hand, the better off both sides will be. ⦁ Thomas Graham, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, served as the senior director for Russia on the U.S. National Security Council staff (2004-07).

Washington, Moscow can be allies on key world issues
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION Great power politics is an art in managing adversarial relationships on the international stage. Ideas floated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, suggesting that Russia and the United States could form a strong and lasting alliance, defied geopolitical logic. However, that does not mean Moscow and Washington cannot maintain a relationship based on mutual respect and find common ground on resolving at least some of the core problems facing the international community today. The end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union’s swift dissolution created an atmosphere of exuberant triumphalism and instilled a victory culture in the American foreign policy and defense establishment. In the 1990s, Washington’s power elite came to believe that American political, economic and military predominance in the world was permanent and irreversible. In 1992, Francis Fukuyama posited in his “The End of History and the Last Man” that the global ascent of the American liberal order will bring about an end to ideological competition as we know it. SEE ALSO: Russia can be an ally to patriotic Americans Promises made to then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev guaranteeing that NATO will not expand beyond German borders were almost immediately discarded. Successive Democratic and Republican administrations paid lip service to friendly relations with Moscow, while pushing the envelope of NATO expansion further east toward the Russian border, finally incorporating the three former Baltic republics of the USSR and calling for future membership in the military bloc for Ukraine and Georgia. Further inflaming the tensions, the Bush administration took upon itself to unilaterally abrogate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which for decades served as the cornerstone of strategic nuclear balance between the two countries, starting on an ambitious program of building missile interceptor sites positioned on Russia’s borders. Moscow’s objections on both counts were plainly ignored. The seeds of mistrust currently hampering the ailing Russian-American relations were sewn back then. If the words of American leaders could not be trusted, and if Washington did not see a place for a strong and successful Russia in its New World Order, then Moscow had to act to protect its national sovereignty and assure the security of its citizens by means that were available to it under the circumstances. What happened next set the stage for the rampant hysteria concerning Russia’s role in the world and in U.S. politics Washington is experiencing today.In 2013 Russia became the first country to successfully prevent an already planned out U.S. military strike against a third country. Moscow’s dramatic diplomatic intercession allowed chemical weapons stocks to be removed and destroyed in Syria, without a single American missile being fired off U.S. naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The Obama administration, striving for the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, proceeded to provide covert military, communications and economic assistance to various rebel opposition groups of questionable repute. Russia’s success in protecting its ally in Syria stunned the Obama administration and Washington’s foreign policy managers. After all, it seemed just two decades before, in their formative years, that Russia was the sick man of Europe, that Moscow was firmly on a trajectory of political and economic destabilization and collapse. For the American political class, which allowed itself to believe that Pax Americana was forever, any successful move to defy Washington’s will in the world was not just a geopolitical, but an ideological and even psychological blow. Instead of seeking compromise, Washington doubled down. The old order had to be preserved at all costs, whether it was providing support for more and more radical Islamic fundamentalist groups fighting against government forces in Syria or extreme nationalist forces in Ukraine, unleashing a bloody civil war against their nation’s own Russian-speaking populations. Russia’s attempts to negotiate a lasting truce in Syria with then-U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry were knocked down by the Pentagon and CIA. At one point in late 2016, in a bout of anger and apparent helplessness, officials at Foggy Bottom even announced that it was ceasing negotiations with Russia on the topic of Syria altogether, only to resume them a few days later. Despite the successful outcome of multifaceted negotiations with Tehran, in which Moscow worked together with Washington, cooperation on other topics of mutual concern was purposefully limited by the Obama White House. During the 1970s and 1980s, Cold War tempers flared from time to time, but geopolitical competition was an expected and accepted part of the international scene. It was certainly not a surprise to anyone and did not elicit hysterical or unpredictable reactions from either side. During the years of detente, Soviet leaders had cordial and at times even overtly warm summits with their American counterparts. American astronauts docked in space with Soviet cosmonauts (“Soyuz–Apollo”). American tourists visited Soviet cities and were frequent travelers on Soviet cruise ships. This did not make Washington and Moscow allies, but it helped make their adversarial relationship more manageable and predictable. The hysterical reaction of significant and influential sections of the American political establishment to the election of a new U.S. president, who simply stated his willingness to seek compromise with Russia, shows how unprepared Washington still is to accept the fading of the American-dominated New World Order of the 1990s and the transition to a multipolar world. The sooner Washington accepts the new reality on the ground, the sooner it would be possible to rebuild health, constructive and productive relations between two great powers that have a common stake in assuring global political and economic stability.⦁ Viktor Olevich is a political analyst, lead expert of the Center for Actual Politics.

Russia can be an ally to patriotic Americans
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION The Kremlin and its current leadership have long memories. The Russian attempts to hurt Hillary Clinton in her presidential race against Donald Trump hark back to when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to get Vladimir Putin thrown out of office at the turn of the decade. Mr. Putin holds grudges. But the biggest grudge he yearns to satisfy, and in many ways partially has, is the collapse of the Soviet Union at the hands of the West. That would be the West we all used to know: the one that stood up for freedom, American values, liberty, peace and capitalism. SEE ALSO: Washington, Moscow can be allies on key world issues Yes, Russia aims to delegitimize the West and its former quest for all of the aforementioned attributes. This is what really brought down the USSR. It wasn’t just the arms race. It wasn’t just Ronald Reagan and NATO. It wasn’t just Soviet top-down management. It was that the West was different — the West stood for a better way of life for human beings. The fact that America has stepped away from these values has not stopped Mr. Putin from continuing to attempt to drive a stake through the heart of our political system and to reduce American and European power globally at every turn. The Kremlin is destabilizing governments in Eastern Europe to pull them back toward Moscow’s influence. It is supporting populist leaders in the West who disagree with the culturally Marxist, “progressive” agenda of Western leaders for the past several decades, which also happens to align with Moscow’s agenda. Russia is building military power around the world, and Russia is not afraid to use it to satisfy certain cravings like a foothold in the Middle East for the new Russian state. In short, Russia will continue to undermine America and the rest of the West at every opportunity. However, I do not believe Russia wants to defeat or destroy America. The Kremlin just wants to shape the West’s influence to its liking so it can do what it wants without interference to rebuild the Russian empire’s influence around the world. We are moving back to the future to a dangerous time in human history, where the conquest theory has taken hold again, where might makes right, where freedom is a fleeting concept, not even remembered or understood or appreciated by the new generations of the West. The death match between communism and capitalism is a thing of the past. No one really believes in communism anymore, except American college students and their tenured profs who can spew Marxist dogma without fear of consequence. No, today the struggle is between those who value their own culture, their own national identity and their own personal freedom versus the globalists who want to destroy all of the above. To the globalist, no lie, no falsehood, no deceitful campaign against a gas that is required for life but treated as a pollutant is too diabolical. Whether it be global cooling, nuclear winter, the population bomb or climate change, they all fit a pattern of control — the control of flyover country. The globalists want control of your money, your life, even your children. Nothing is sacred or off limits. It is here that Russia can be an ally to patriotic Americans. Here we can find common ground with Moscow to defeat the scourges that threaten both our motherlands. Whether that be defeating the jihadi armies in the Middle East or combating the Islamic State’s minions in our capitals, these are areas where we can work together. The leftist politicians and their corrupt media want to lump all right-wing news outlets together as being Russian propaganda outlets. I would say that in many ways, the Marxist, no-lie-is-too-big, fake news media simply despise the truth when it is told. It is much easier to call Breitbart a Russian outlet than to deal with the uncomfortable facts that the media outlet reports on a daily basis.Very simply, when patriotic American interests to defeat the usurpation of our freedoms align with the Kremlin’s in countering the globalist media’s narrative, we can be allies. Calling the Islamification of the West what it is, an invasion sponsored by globalist powers, is one such instance. Where Russia continues to attempt to undermine American security around the world, we will continue to be adversaries. In these instances, the Kremlin has to be confronted.It will take a special type of leader to navigate this swamp of conflicting priorities and dangers that freedom-loving people in the world now face. Donald Trump just may be that type of leader.L. Todd Wood writes a column and blog for The Washington Times. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Trump takes call from Putin, talks cooperation to fight ISIS
.B
President Trump spoke by phone Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, engaging in a wide-ranging discussion that included how the two countries can work together to combat radial Islamic terrorism, according to the White House. The call, which the White House described as a congratulatory call from Mr. Putin, lasted approximately one hour. Mr. Tump and Mr. Putin specifically talked about working together to fight the Islamic State, also know as ISIS or ISIL, and ending the civil war in Syria, said the White House. The first call between the two leaders was hotly anticipated by Washington watchers, as Mr. Putin loomed large over the presidential election because of allegations that Russia was responsible for email hacks that hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and therefore benefited Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump also came under fire during the campaign for praising Mr. Putin for his strong leadership. The White House characterized the call as positive and a significant start to improving the relationship between the U.S. and Russia. Mr. Trump’s critics has speculated that he intends to lift sanctions on Russia, which include financial sanctions, imposed because of the country’s annexation of Crimea and other military interference in eastern Ukraine. In response to U.S. intelligence linking Russia to the email hacks, President Obama last month expelled 35 Russian intelligence officials and shut down two Russian government compounds in the U.S. The White House statement on the call did not mention sanctions. In the call, Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin expressed hope that their two countries can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern, according to the White House.

Putin reaches out to Trump for cooperation, calls Democrats sore losers
.B
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked to “restore the framework of bilateral cooperation” with the U.S. in a letter to President-elect Donald Trump — a note the transition team released Friday, the same day the Kremlin leader called American Democrats sore losers. The letter, written earlier this month, offers Christmas and New Year’s wishes. Mr. Putin then suggests that the two nations find a way to get beyond the loggerheads of the past few years. “I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able — by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner — to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level,” Mr. Putin said. Mr. Trump, in a statement, called it “a very nice letter” and said “his thoughts are so correct.” “I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path,” he said. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump had positive things to say about each other’s leadership style. Democrats and the Obama administration have accused Mr. Putin of meddling in the U.S. election to try to sink Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state tried but failed to earn better relations with Russia. But answering questions Friday from a group of journalists assembled for his annual end-of-year press conference, Mr. Putin said Democrats were wrong to blame “outside factors” for Mrs. Clinton’s loss. Democrats “are losing on all fronts and looking for scapegoats on whom to lay the blame,” Mr. Putin told reporters, as translated by the Kremlin. “I think that this is an affront to their own dignity. It is important to know how to lose gracefully,” he said. Asked specifically to comment on accusations that Russia used state-sponsored hacking to influence results of the election, Mr. Putin denied responsibility before noting that arguments about “who did it” are less important than what the hacked emails showed. “These days, it is very easy to designate a random country as the source of attack while being in a completely different location,” Mr. Putin said of the hackers. “But is this important? I think the most important thing is the information that the hackers revealed to the public,” he said. He also said the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz over the information vindicates its authenticity. “What is the best proof that the hackers uncovered truthful information? The proof is that after the hackers demonstrated how public opinion had been manipulated within the Democratic Party, against one candidate rather than the other, against candidate [Bernard] Sanders, the Democratic National Committee chairperson resigned. This means she admitted that the hackers revealed the truth,” Mr. Putin said. Security analysts believe state-sponsored hackers penetrated the DNC and the email accounts of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign manager, John Podesta, before passing along their contents to WikiLeaks for publication before the Nov. 8 election. President Obama said last week that he has “great confidence” in intelligence reports that links those hacks and others to Russian actors and that their actions were aimed at having Mr. Trump win the White House race. “This happened at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Mr. Obama said last week. “Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.” A day earlier, CrowdStrike, a security firm hired to examine the DNC breach, said the perpetrators used a specific strain of malware used exclusively for nearly a decade in cyberattacks attributed to Russia, including a previously undisclosed hacking campaign in recent months against the Ukrainian military. The letter was released and the Moscow news conference was held a day after Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump suggested that they might push to expand their countries’ nuclear capabilities.

Russia’s deep culture of fatalism gives it an edge in the carnage of Syria
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Several years ago, an airliner crashed in Russia because of pilot error, killing scores of people on board. At the crash site, a Western aid worker asked one of the government officials at the scene how something like this could happen. The response: “This is Russia.” Human life in Russia is an uncertain proposition, which everyone knows could end early and unexpectedly. There is a pervasive fatalism, a belief that the end is coming and it won’t be good, so enjoy things while you can. This has permeated Russian culture for centuries. From Ivan the Terrible killing his own son to the executions of the Romanovs and the aristocracy by the Bolsheviks, Russians have believed a single human life is worth much less than the success of the state. A friend in Moscow recently told me that Russians look down on the commercial movies of the West where the superhero saves the day. I asked what is a good Russian movie. “In the end, the worst thing happens and everybody dies. This is life,” I was told. You could see this fatalism even on a trip to Moscow or St. Petersburg in the go-go 2000s. Russians were spending their newfound oil wealth as fast as they could: traveling, eating expensive meals and buying luxury cars. It was as if they knew the good times would not last and they had to spend their rubles before they were taken away. During “The Great Patriotic War,” as the Russians call it, if the Nazi lines stood firm and Russian troops retreated, they frequently would be shot as they returned to friendly lines. This tended to sharpen the courage to take on the enemy, no matter the odds. Russian artillery units bombed their own villages as the enemy advanced so the Nazis would not enjoy the spoils of their victory. Stalin famously starved 20 million Ukrainians, who sat in the breadbasket of Europe, so he could feed the Soviet workers in the cities. Flash forward to 2016, and ask Muscovites how they feel about Russian soldiers dying in Syria. The typical response goes something like this: “They took the job to earn more money than we can here in Moscow, so they can die. I have no sympathy for them.” Human life is not sacrosanct in Russia. The culture does not wail and gnash its teeth over civilian deaths, if those deaths advance the needs of Mother Russia. Russia has adopted the same attitude in Syria. Civilian deaths do not matter and may in fact aid the cause by hastening the ultimate Russian and Syrian victory. Western elites have forgotten what victory means. Secretary of State John Kerry famously chastised Russian President Vladimir Putin when he annexed Crimea by saying modern nations shouldn’t act as if it were the 19th century. Mr. Kerry was also famously wrong. Russians don’t value some nebulous, high-minded globalist agenda. They value victory, whatever the cost. Civilian deaths do not matter, especially if they are on the adversary’s side. No amount of hand-wringing and preaching from the White House press room will change that. I’ve often wondered where this attitude comes from and how it was integrated so thoroughly into Russian culture. I think a lot has to do with centuries of living under the control of the Mongolian hordes from the East, always paying tribute to the local warlord. It comes from centuries of conquest and survival, an attitude you can still see in eastern Ukraine. Russia never experienced the Enlightenment. The society developed away from the intellectual currents that came to dominate the capitals of Europe, followed its own track, and was sheltered from the ideas and values that helped create the European Union. But as the EU implodes in a spasm of nationalist fury, it raises the question of who actually has the more successful model for the long-term survival of a nation. In any event, don’t look for the Russians to hold back in Syria. They will bomb hospitals, schools and civilian enclaves if they need to. Combined with President Obama’s incompetent machinations in the Middle East, that approach has proved to be the road to victory in Aleppo and elsewhere in the region. • L.

Worries over American ascendancy 
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Consult any long-term American statistical compilation (say, on the economy or on the crime rate) and one might be forgiven for concluding that the trend lines look quite positive for Americans’ sense of security and prosperity. Yet aggregate numbers mask much deeper worries — among both business and political elites as well the mass of average citizens — about the future of the United States. A palpable sense of insecurity has cast a shadow over American politics, and helps to explain the unprecedented twists and turns of the 2016 U.S. election cycle. Moreover, this sentiment is not easily localized around one or two core issues, such as in the 1980 campaign, when fear that the Soviet Union was gaining ascendancy and concerns about a stagnating economy at home were the two principal concerns. (Moreover, in that election, voters had two very clear policy approaches between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.) Today, the anxiety is much more general — that familiar landmarks denoting American power and prestige are being washed away and the institutions which in previous years safeguarded American strength at home and abroad have been hollowed out or corrupted from within. Sixteen years ago, the 2000 elections took place in a world where the United States had triumphed in the Cold War and appeared to be the indispensable hub holding the global order together. The U.S. economy was capable of regenerating itself to create a new wave of prosperity that could sustain the middle class aspirations of the bulk of the citizenry. Today, even though Americans might disagree as to the causes and possible solutions, the majority of voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and there is a growing, palpable fear that both the American Dream and the American Century may be headed for a close. One broad wave of insecurity is what might be termed systemic insecurity. For 60 years, the United States played the leading role in creating military, security, political and economic institutions that safeguarded a liberal, globalized world order and which cemented American leadership. Even a few short years ago, there was high confidence that the United States, in developing two broad free trade arrangements — one for the Pacific basin, the other for the Euro-Atlantic world — had positioned itself as the fundamental keystone for world trade, while also extending and expanding the reach of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and cementing its various security partnerships in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2016 there is growing concern that America may lack the capacity, the will or both to see through any ambitious agenda of global leadership, while other American partners, starting with the Europeans, are similarly engulfed in crisis. The fear that the world may be transitioning from an American-led order to what Ian Bremmer has termed a “G-Zero” world — where no one country or group of countries can set and enforce a worldwide security and economic agenda — leads to concerns that the gains that have been achieved over the last 30 years could be reversed. For some, the concern is that America will be shoved aside by Russia, China or some other set of rising powers who will overturn a liberal system; for others, it is that an America exhausted by the burdens of “running the world” will withdraw into a more isolationist pose. In either case, for elites whose position rests on continued American primacy, the world is now much more uncertain than it was even a few years ago. Elite concern that the U.S.-led order is eroding is paired with a growing sense among many ordinary Americans that they have been denied the rewards they ought to reap from the American role in sustaining the current global system. Americans were promised that the forces of globalization would aid and abet their prosperity. Instead, a more open system allows for jobs, technology and capital to leave at a moment’s notice while lowering barriers and exposing the homeland to new threats (from migration to pandemics) while entangling Americans in a myriad number of conflicts around the world. The notion that the United States ought to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine or push back against Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea — even at the risk of heightened conflict with Russia or China, in order to defend abstract principles of the international order makes little sense to voters who do not see how the Russian flag flying over Sevastopol or the Chinese choice to expend resources to build artificial islands impacts their job prospects, what they pay at the gas pump or their sense of day-to-day security. A curious confluence of some parts of the American right and left has come together to question what benefits Americans derive from extending security guarantees to growing numbers of states or crafting massive free trade pacts. Candidates George W. Bush and Barack Obama, respectively, promised an end to nation-building abroad and a focus on nation-building at home, yet the cumulative result of their 16 years in office has, in the eyes of many Americans, eroded the economic and physical security many felt they enjoyed in 2000. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Clinton campaign explicitly plays on American nostalgia for the peace and prosperity of the 1990s while Donald Trump proclaims “Make America Great Again.” In addressing the systemic and personal insecurities that grip the American body politic, the next U.S. president may face an impossible task: how to increase U.S. influence in the world while minimizing American commitments, and how to shift more of the burdens of maintaining the international system to others while reaping a greater share of the rewards. • Nikolas K.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Russia is the largest country in the world, with very low population density and an intricate interplay of neighbors. Its vast territory makes Russia a self-sufficient universe containing everything it might need for development. On the other hand, low population density and permeability of borders make it internally fragile and heavily exposed to the influence of its neighbors. Since Russia’s key possibilities for development lie within the country, its main foreign policy goal is to block external negative influences and avoid being drawn into confrontation with opponents. Historically, the outside world and internal political stability, which are closely interrelated, have always been the principal condition for utilizing Russia’s advantages. Russia has existed within its present borders (excluding the North Caucasus and Khabarovsk Territory) for more than three centuries since the time of Peter the Great. Creating and preserving the world’s largest state amid fierce competition is undoubtedly an achievement of the Russian people. But the Russian state has a number of vulnerabilities. Historically, Russia has been known for large distances between towns, the absence of natural defenses against external invasions, exposed lines of communication, a harsh northern climate and a short growing season. Many regions of the country are not suitable for farming, and the main industrial centers are far away from energy sources. The government has to ensure security and maintain uniform health service and education standards across 11 time zones from Magadan to Kaliningrad. All of the above makes the country fragile, value-added production complicated and social changes slow. Keeping the large Russian state running is a monumental and truly unprecedented task. That is why internal weakening and social implosion always were and remain the main threat for Russia. In most cases internal implosions threw countries back decades in their development and sometimes jeopardized their very survival. Russian authorities try to address the country’s fragility and permeability by strengthening military security and stimulating steady population growth. By so doing, they try to increase the vitality of the state and make it more resilient to external and internal stresses. Russia’s foreign policy is a direct continuation of the domestic one. Over the past three centuries, Moscow has been the dynamic core of Eurasia and a major attraction for its neighbors. Russia was among the first to have brought the fruits of European culture to the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Far East. But in the 21st century the future of Eurasia will not be shaped entirely by Russia, which will have to compete with China, the European Union, the United States, Turkey and Iran. Russia should secure its place among great powers at the negotiating table in order not to become an item on their menu. Key external threats to Russia come from Islamic extremism in Syria and Iraq, drug trafficking from Afghanistan, a possible escalation of conflicts in post-Soviet countries around North Korea or Iran and the civil war in Ukraine. The imperative of maintaining strategic stability with the United States requires that Moscow modernize its armed forces, military-industrial complex and global navigation and space communication systems. Unresolved problems in Europe’s security and bloc-based approaches to it leave Russia no choice but view NATO as a potential military adversary. Of all the post-Soviet states, it is Russia that benefited the most from the disintegration of the Soviet Union. But Russia lost critical infrastructure facilities (pipelines, railroads, seaports, military bases, spaceports and production capacities) which remained in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. For 20 years, the main purpose of Russia’s policy was to remove major Soviet infrastructure facilities from under the influence of hostile neighbors, while building preferential relations and alliances with friendly states such as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Russia also tried to reduce its dependence on Ukraine by laying alternative pipelines bypassing Ukraine, building a new base for the Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk and relocating defense contracts from Ukrainian enterprises to Russian ones. Following the reincorporation of Crimea, Russia has no more vital interests left outside its borders: neither the rocket launch site in Kazakhstan, nor cargo ports in the Baltic States, nor the railroads in Belarus can serve as a pretext for Moscow’s claims. Russia will have to interfere in the internal affairs of post-Soviet states only if ethnic Russians living there are subjected to repression. In all other instances, Russia will avoid getting involved in conflicts along its borders. Russia seeks to become a leading world power along with the United States and China, but with no success so far. By waiting and building up its strength, Russia becomes a strategic balancer which should be interested in remaining independent in pursuing its own policy and assessing international events. A key international threat to Russia will stem from the need to stray from the role of balancer and join one of the centers of global competition in the 21st century — the U.S. or China. • Andrei Sushentsov is program director at the Valdai International Discussion Club, Head of the Foreign Policy Advisory Group and Associate Professor at the MGIMO University of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

US RUSSIA CROSSTALK: Middle East stability talks
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION After a year or so following the entry into force of the Iran nuclear deal, it is possible to draw some conclusions about the controversial agreement and arms control in general. First, despite the Israeli government’s strong opposition to the deal and the heated debate it generated in the Republican-controlled Congress, it has become increasingly clear that there was never any real alternative to the arrangement. With the Obama administration under pressure from Israel, the congressional Republicans could have held out for more far-reaching constraints on Iran’s nuclear bomb-making capabilities, but this step would have been strongly opposed by the other participants in the negotiations — Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain. The result would not only have been a negotiating stalemate, but the rapid erosion of the multilateral economic sanctions that brought Iran to the table in the first place. Under these circumstances, Iran would have been able to freely proceed with its development of a nuclear weapon. The other alternative open to Washington would have been to undertake, perhaps with the assistance of Israel, a military strike against Iran’s hardened and decentralized nuclear infrastructure, an attack that would have probably required hundreds of bombing missions. In the light of today’s turmoil and conflict in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, the idea of an American-Iranian war seems almost unthinkable. A second conclusion is that had the United States and the other major powers launched their negotiating effort a decade or so earlier, it probably would have been possible to reach a better deal with Tehran. Arms control agreements, including the famous U.S.-Soviet strategic arms accords negotiated during the Cold War, tend to ratify military facts on the ground: They reflect, but do not fundamentally alter, the prevailing balance of power. Thus the Iranian nuclear deal reflects the fact that the Tehran regime spent billions over 20 years to develop and build over 20,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium. Even with the pressure of an international sanctions regime, Iran was not prepared to destroy these centrifuges as a price for reaching agreement. But in 2003, following the American invasion of Iraq, the regime signaled to Washington that it was prepared to enter negotiations over the nuclear issue. At that time, Iran possessed only a few hundred centrifuges. Had this occurred, there was the real possibility that an accord limiting Iran to a far smaller centrifuge could be reached. In retrospect, the failure to engage earlier with Iran on the nuclear issue looks like a major blunder. A third conclusion is that while agreements can enhance stability and predictability, they do not transform political relationships. The major achievement of the Iran nuclear deal is that for the next decade or so, we can remain confident that with adequate verification of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), the regime will not be able to surprise the world with the sudden deployment of a nuclear arsenal. Among other things, such a development would destabilize the region, triggering a nuclear race with other regional powers, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. But the agreement, despite the gradual removal of sanctions, has not transformed Iran’s political position in the region or the wider international system, including the United States. Indeed, sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia groups in the region are fueling a bigger rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the quiet hopes of some in the Obama administration that the deal would lead to a new “detente” between Tehran and Washington have not come to pass. This conclusion also extends to the Russian-American relationship. It is frequently noted that Washington and Moscow worked closely in reaching the deal, the suggestion being that U.S.-Russian cooperation on Iran can somehow be extended to issues where real differences are at play, such as Ukraine. This appears doubtful. Both Washington and Moscow share a common interest in curbing Iranian nuclearization and heading off nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. In the case of Ukraine, both powers appear to be approaching the conflict as a zero-sum game. Despite these conclusions, there are still some important open questions. One is the longer-term evolution of Iran itself. Will Iran, over the life of the agreement, gradually shed its revolutionary political character and evolve into a “normal” state? There are conflicting signs. On the one hand, the country’s younger, urban population clearly yearns for Western-style modernity, and this will be reinforced by the end of sanctions, greater international contacts and economic growth. On the other hand, Iran’s theocratic leadership has shown itself to be tenacious and tough in holding on to power. A bigger question concerns the tumultuous regional environment. Iranian normalization will be harder to achieve in a region that is in the midst of violent sectarian turmoil, what Richard Haass of the Council of Foreign Relations has called a new “Thirty Years War.” If the current turmoil, including the Syrian civil war, the fragmentation of Iraq and the rise of the Islamic State, worsens and spreads, incentives for Iranian nuclearization are likely to grow. Over the longer term, this would not be in Russia’s or America’s interest. Thus, there are real reasons for Washington and Moscow and perhaps others, such as China, to engage in deep discussions on Middle East stability and security. A place to begin might be to develop a common strategy for defeating Islamic State. Iran would be an important component in such an effort. • Richard Burt served as assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs in the Reagan administration and as chief arms control negotiator in the George H.W.

Iran nuclear deal: One year later
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: A year ago, on July 14, 2015, the P5+1 agreed with Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It was a compromise outlining principles and stages for achieving a comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue in order to decrease tensions that had been mounting for years. The global community recognized that Tehran had a legitimate right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and promised to lift international sanctions in exchange for a substantial reduction in Iran’s nuclear activity with specific deadlines and more intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. If Iran fully delivers on its commitments under the deal, it could be entitled, in the future, to develop a peaceful nuclear program without any restrictions as a full member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although the deal resulted from many years of intense negotiations involving the six countries and Iran, it was made possible primarily by the pragmatism and common sense of the U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Vienna agreement prevented the Iranian nuclear issue from growing into another regional conflict in an otherwise restive Middle East and helped strengthen the nonproliferation regime. This past year has shown that the parties to the agreement are responsible and committed to fulfilling their obligations. The IAEA said Tehran cooperated proactively by voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol to the IAEA safeguards agreement. Russia is working with Iran on practical issues related to converting the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant into a production facility for heavy isotopes that will be used for medical purposes. Russia and Iran are taking practical steps in another area related to implementing the joint comprehensive plan. They are working bilaterally on removing excessive stockpiles of low-enriched uranium from Iran in exchange for deliveries of natural uranium. All international sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program have been lifted, which makes it possible for Tehran to step up trade and economic cooperation with the international community, import technology and innovation, attract foreign investment, and increase hydrocarbon production and exports. There is no doubt that this will enhance political and economic stability in the region. That said, the prospects for successfully implementing the joint agreement will depend to a large extent on the willingness of the U.S. and Iran to further honor their commitments. It is no secret that mutual distrust and suspicion are still strong between the two countries. The constructive and bold steps by the Obama administration and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to hammer out the nuclear deal did not dispel the serious problems in the relations between the two countries and the major differences in their worldviews. Just as the conservative wing of the U.S. establishment, mostly Republican, that constantly calls for a review of the Vienna agreements and for tightening the requirements regarding implementation of the joint comprehensive plan by Tehran, Iranian conservatives and radicals warn of a possible withdrawal from the deal if Washington fails to abide by its terms and imposes new sanctions on Iran. By stepping up political rhetoric and propaganda against each other, Washington and Tehran could destroy the favorable atmosphere in which the agreement has existed so far. In fact, if the next U.S. administration moves toward reviewing the plan to impose stricter requirements, this will certainly lead to a sharp response by Tehran, as has already been the case during the tense negotiation process. From a pragmatic standpoint, neither Washington nor Tehran is interested in the failure of the nuclear agreement. Iran desperately needs to bolster its social and economic development by fulfilling its immense potential and to have a more stable domestic political landscape, and the lifting of sanctions creates a favorable atmosphere for doing just that. Washington, it must be assumed, does not need another escalation in the Middle East that would result from Iran’s withdrawal from the Vienna deal and may lead to unpredictable consequences. For this reason, all parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action should calmly implement the existing agreements, step by step, without whipping up alarmist hysteria and by discussing and resolving the issues that could arise within the Joint Commission that has been established to deal with contentious questions. In addition, it is important not to add elements that are not directly related to the agreement. Russia attaches great importance to the implementation of the Plan of Action. At all stages of the Geneva talks, Russia was eager to find solutions to the issues and is now prepared to fulfill its obligations in good faith by facilitating the implementation of the deal in a comprehensive manner. The deal resulted from a compromise, but it remains the only way to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and helps diffuse tensions in the conflict-ridden Middle East, offering opportunities for mobilizing joint efforts to fight international terrorism and extremism, which should be the key aim for the international community. • Alexander Maryasov is ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

Turkey as a mirror of the New World
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION The policies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are typically viewed as the determining factor for everything that happens within or in connection with Turkey. And, doubtless, a president with such a single-minded desire for power, glory and a place in history does have a significant impact on a country’s course. However, Turkey is an example of how the world is changing in general, and objective factors play a no-less-crucial role than subjective ones in that process. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire 100 years ago, Turkey began searching for a new place in the world and a different identity. It seemingly achieved those goals in the 20th century by forming a secular nationalist republic, joining NATO and forming an alliance with the West in the 1950s. What’s more, Turkey played a crucial role in NATO as the country situated on the southern flank of the main line of confrontation. The end of the Cold War gave rise to new opportunities, ambitions and risks. The Atlantic bloc won that struggle but lost its raison d’etre — and, in truth, has yet to find it even now. The U.S. began losing interest in the regions where NATO had previously focused, leaving other member states more room to maneuver. The collapse of the Soviet Union left what seemed to be a valuable prize up for political grabs, and Turkey was the first to begin eyeing it. Although the idea in the early 1990s that Ankara could become the leader of a vast Turkic community from Ashkhabad to Kazan encountered economic limitations, it clearly showed that Turkey would not be pigeonholed as a “loyal member of NATO” and would strive for greater status in the world. This rethinking contributed to internal changes. The era of nondemocratic — and especially, military — regimes, came to an end everywhere, and new forces came to power on the wave of democratization. The practice of imposing certain forms of government on the people went out of fashion and lost force. The rise of the Justice and Development Party with Mr. Erdogan at its head was a natural result of the general trend toward politics that reflect the views and opinions of the majority of citizens. And, for some reason, it came as a surprise for Westerners who supported “the promotion of democracy” that the same trend meant the rise of political Islam in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Turkey under Mr. Erdogan has become an example of how a country with the traditions of a strong culture and a great power, with good economic prospects and a strategically important geographic location, can set the wrong priorities and “choke” on its overabundance of opportunities. The new push by Ankara is very understandable — the Turkish leader no doubt realized that the age of superpowers had passed and that countries belonging to what Parag Khanna called the “second world” are coming to enjoy greater opportunities for global influence. However, having “greater opportunities” does not mean that “everything is possible,” much less that leaders always know how to use those opportunities correctly. Turkey achieved the opposite of what it wanted by attempting to play the new game on all fronts at once: by trying to join the European Union, hoping to become the leading power in the Middle East, testing the waters for participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Eurasia and by positioning itself as a world player with the intention to actively participate in resolving the Iranian nuclear problem. The result has been major tensions at both the regional and global levels. Turkey illustrates several key trends in today’s world. The first is “the return of history” to practical politics. Many more countries are incorporating policies from their past than did so during the Cold War or immediately afterward. Turkey, for example, has clearly stepped up its focus on the pre-republic period of its history. The second trend is the gradual erosion of relations between members of political blocs. The ordinarily strict discipline within NATO suffers as member states pursue divergent priorities. Turkey serves as a vivid example. Increasingly at odds with its closest allies, it characteristically attacked a Russian combat aircraft without first consulting its Western partners. Third is the realization that, contrary to the expectations of the 1990s and 2000s, economic interdependence does not guarantee political unity. The rapid breakdown in Russian-Turkish relations following the downing of the Russian bomber last November showed that it was naive to hope that the globalization process was, of itself, necessarily beneficial. And last is the recognition that the long-awaited multipolar world differs from expectations. In place of the anticipated balance of power between several of the most powerful states, a whole range of political players of varying calibers has emerged, each convinced they can play the game according to their own rules. What’s more, these new players are not particularly concerned with achieving overall stability and order because their priority is to satisfy their own needs and improve their status in the regional and global hierarchy. Thus, Turkey is not an exception but the rule. It is not the fruit of personal ambition, but a reflection of general trends; not a deviation from the norm but the “new normal.” Both the United States and Russia will have to give up hope of achieving “normalization” — at least, as they have traditionally understood that word. And as strange as it might sound in the current situation, both countries might very well find common ground on that basis. ⦁ Fyodor Lukyanov is director of Research at the Valdai International Discussion Club and editor of Russia in Global Affairs journal.

Mideast still needs Turkey
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION Turkey once was looked to, with good reason, as a model for the Middle East. It was a well-established republic, more stable and more democratic than much of the rest of that region. The legacy of modernity of Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic, has given his country a lasting advantage over most of the Arab world. Straddling two continents, Turkey was well-suited to be a cultural, economic and political bridge between Europe and the Middle East. Turkey also is predominantly Muslim and, as such, all the more equipped to be a model for majority Muslim countries of the Middle East. The rise to power 14 years ago of the Justice and Development (AK) Party, generally described as mildly Islamist, enhanced the model. The party demonstrated how it is possible not only for such a party to assume power through peaceful democratic means in an avowedly secular republic, but also, as AK-led governments did in their first several years in office, to compile a solid record of good governance and economic growth. The tough neighborhood in which Turkey lives gives Ankara an incentive to reach out to the countries to its south, if only to help prevent their troubles from spreading northward, and AK-led governments have done exactly that. Even the longstanding problem of Kurdish separatism seemed to become less of a problem, as Ankara made overtures to Kurds within Turkey while also taking a more positive attitude toward the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq. Within the past few years this favorable picture of the Turkish role has fallen apart, largely for two reasons. One is the increasingly authoritarian ways of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former prime minister moved to the presidency with the intention of transforming that office into a strong executive, but any such constitutional change matters less now than a disturbing erosion of basic civil and political rights. The press is being muzzled, and courts are being hobbled. The latest move by Mr. Erdogan to crush any challenge to his accumulation of power has been to declare a former ally, the influential movement led by exiled preacher Fethullah Gulen, to be a terrorist group — a groundless charge. The other major reason that Turkey’s role has changed has been the civil war in Syria, on Turkey’s southern doorstep. The fluctuating relationship between Ankara and the Assad regime in Damascus has settled into one of strong antagonism, with Mr. Erdogan’s determination to oppose the Syrian regime getting in the way of efforts by others to counter the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS. The Kurdish problem has flared anew, with Ankara opposing any cooperation with a Kurdish militia in Syria that others have found to be an effective opponent to Islamic State, but one that the Turkish government considers to be an arm of a rebellious Kurdish group in Turkey. The effects of these developments on Turkey’s relations with outside powers have been profound and uniformly negative. To the West, the same Turkey that has been a valued partner on many diplomatic and security matters (and still has the second-largest army in NATO) now presents a significant human rights problem. The main reason Western relations with Turkey have not gotten any worse than they have is European dependence on Turkey in stemming the flow of migrants from the Middle East to Europe. The downturn in Turkish-Russian relations has been even sharper. A decade ago that relationship was warming significantly, notwithstanding the historical enmity that included several wars between the Ottoman and Russian empires. The Syrian civil war, with Moscow and Ankara backing opposing sides and with fierce fighting very close to the border with Turkey, has thrown the relationship back into the freezer. The worst episode came last November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane that had flown briefly into Turkish airspace during a mission against Syrian rebels. A recent poll shows that the Russian public now considers Turkey to be one of Russia’s three most significant adversaries, along with the United States and Ukraine. The Russian government insists that Turkey must take responsibility for the November incident before relations can get back to normal. What all outside powers should remember is that, however difficult their relations with Mr. Erdogan’s government have become, Turkey is still an essential player in the Middle East. Its active participation certainly is critical to any de-escalation and resolution of the highly destructive war in Syria. Ankara also has a major role to play in the stabilization of Iraq. Turkish cooperation is important in countering Islamic State and other forms of Islamist extremism and terrorism. As one of three major non-Arab states, along with Iran and Israel, in the area, Turkey is a key part of any balance of power in the Middle East. And Turkey still can set an important example as a modern, democratic, majority-Muslim state. Other powers need to work hard, despite understandable disagreements with the Turks, to respect the fears and sensitivities that are prevailing in Turkey today — and that go far beyond Mr. Erdogan’s ambitions — while looking for avenues for practical cooperation with Ankara. For the West, this does not mean overlooking the infringements of civil and political liberties, which debase the very good example that Turkey could and should be setting for the region. It does mean not focusing narrowly on the migration problem and instead actively engaging with Turkey on other aspects of instability in the Middle East. For Russia, this kind of engagement will require greater flexibility in getting past the shootdown of the Russian jet. It is expecting too much for Turkey to take sole blame for an incident in which the plane did enter Turkish territory. Russia and Turkey need to get back, and soon, to a normal relationship. Too many important interests of both countries are at stake. ⦁ Paul R.

Eurasian unity vs. zero sum
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION One year has passed since Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed a joint statement linking the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) on May 8, 2015. It was a strong and decisive step toward eliminating even the most hypothetical possibility of a conflict between the two powers and served as a formal framework for establishing extensive cooperation and joint development in central Eurasia. Immediately after that move, the remaining EAEU member states announced their support for the agreement and their willingness to establish a system of cooperation with China as well. Investment in transportation and logistics looks especially promising in this regard, as well as opportunities for expanding the industrial manufacturing chain from China westward to include the Central Asian states and Russian Siberia, with its major scientific and natural resources. Beijing has always viewed the SREB as much more than simply a transportation project. China needs economic expansion and is therefore developing investment and new industries in countries to the west. Those plans dovetail nicely with Russia’s goal of establishing stable socio-economic conditions in the countries of that region. The Russian labor market currently absorbs the surplus workforce from three of the most populous and poorest Central Asian countries – Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This represents a significant contribute to regional stability. After all, if those workers were to return home for an extended period, they might fall under the influence of radical jihadists and an explosive situation could develop as a result. But if at least a percentage of that workforce finds employment with Chinese businesses, Russia will have an easier time controlling the movements of those workers. At the same time, Russia remains the most important military power in the region: its forces are stationed in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Moscow also has a presence at the Kant Air Base near Bishkek and the 201st military base near Dushanbe. That balance of forces provides a certain sense of security for the countries of the region. Two of the five countries are EAEU member states and can thus coordinate their cooperation within the framework of supranational institutions. Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia already form the Eurasian Economic Commission and are empowered to deal with foreign trade and other issues. In fact, EAEU leaders decided at their meeting in October 2015 to grant that body the authority to develop a trade and cooperation agreement with China. This is not to say that efforts to link the EAEU and SREB have not faced difficulties. For example, Chinese experts emphasize that political leaders must exercise greater control over the process and force their officials to work more effectively. The national bureaucracies of the EAEU member states continue to make very slow progress in developing a road map for cooperation with China. For its part, China is preoccupied with domestic challenges and also responds slowly. In fact, Beijing still lacks even a tentative vision of which concrete benefits the SREB would produce. The recent slowing of the Chinese economy has also had a negative impact. Some sectors, such as transportation, have been particularly hard hit, with the Chinese state railway system reporting that freight shipments have fallen for the past 26 months. External players such as the United States and Western Europe have the potential to make a positive contribution to regional cooperation. It is a straightforward matter in the case of the latter. European companies – primarily in the mining industry – are already investing in a number of sectors of the regional economy, but have so far been unwilling to invest further. And because many European states face their own financial difficulties at home, they do not exert a significant influence on regional policy or stability. Nonetheless, Europe remains a very important partner for Russia and an integral part of the SREB as its western terminus. As for the U.S., it has always played an ambiguous role in the region. On one hand, Washington has taken an active role in Central Eurasian affairs since the early 1990s, especially following the start of its military operations in Afghanistan. Washington has also made great efforts to strengthen the sovereignty of the Central Asian states that succeeded the former Soviet republics in the region. Russia and the United States occasionally worked together to promote military and political stability in the region and Russia has done a great deal to stabilize Afghanistan – the main potential source of instability in Central Asia. However, fearing that its nightmare of “geostrategic encirclement” might become a reality, Beijing has never been happy with U.S. involvement or the existence of regimes friendly to Washington in the region. Consequently, Beijing has been guarded in its reaction to what experts describe as Washington’s proposal in May 2015 to build the SREB on an equal partnership basis with China. Some experts suggest that current U.S. policy seems to be pushing China westward. The creation of such organizations as the Trans-Pacific Partnership creates completely different conditions for China to cooperate with Southeast Asian states. Many observers even suggest that the U.S. specifically promotes such an arrangement in anticipation that it will lead to direct Sino-Russian competition. But unbiased analysis shows that no grounds exist for such competition to arise. The presence of Chinese money in the region can only serve to strengthen local regimes, add to the security of Russia’s southern flank and enable Moscow to focus greater attention on domestic development and to reinforce security in Europe.  While Beijing never wanted to take responsibility for regional security, it is far away from its perception of Chinese role and interests.Surely, the cooperation in Central Eurasia that Messrs. Putin and Xi agreed to pursue last May is beneficial to everyone. It is to be regretted that geopolitical instinct of the U.S. most likely will be traditional – emerging of a new architecture in Eurasia has to be prevented. Unfortunately, it will mean that zero sum game, which brought so many troubles to Europe trough centuries, will be reproduced in Eurasia.

China transforming into global Rorschach test
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION The combination of China’s growing power with its complexity — and, indeed its inscrutability to outsiders — seems increasingly to be transforming the country into a gigantic global Rorschach test. Because it is possible to see almost anything in China, observers often see what they want to see, sometimes revealing more about themselves than about China itself. Unlike a psychological test, however, China reflects objective realities independent of the viewer. And policymakers in the United States and elsewhere are obliged to make important decisions based on what they discern in this massive messy inkblot. Doing that effectively seems likely to require considerably greater effort in examining key assumptions. China’s potential role in shaping — or breaking — the international system makes American and Russian policy choices especially significant. As the principal architect of today’s international structures, rules and norms, Washington has the most to lose if Beijing actively and directly challenges U.S. international leadership. As the major power most frustrated with the same structures, rules and norms, Russia has the most to gain. Needless to say, many others have a great deal at stake as well, especially China’s neighbors, who have vital security interests, and U.S allies in Asia, Europe and elsewhere, who support, contribute to, and benefit from the existing order. The most problematic assumptions about China relate to its future capabilities and intentions. Assumptions about China’s future capabilities generally rely upon projections of China’s past economic growth and increases in military spending for decades ahead. Conversely, they can rely upon similar predictions about mounting economic and social problems that make China look doomed. In the United States, these contrasting sets of assumptions lead to either great anxiety or relative calm about Beijing’s future military power. In Russia, more optimistic assumptions about China’s growth make it an appealing security and economic partner — particularly when facing a possibly enduring confrontation with the United States and its NATO allies. The range of assumptions about Beijing’s future intent seems considerably narrower in America, particularly after years of tension in the waters surrounding China’s coasts. In the United States, China appears determined to assert its claims in the South China Sea and, as Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump argues, to maximize its economic gains at others’ expense. On the surface, Russia’s leaders appear to see China’s intent quite differently. President Vladimir Putin has energetically pursued a closer bilateral relationship with Beijing throughout his time in office. He has also cooperated with China to create and expand multilateral institutions like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS group. This has included a host of summits, trade deals, joint military exercises and other projects. At bottom, Russia’s policies seem founded on assumptions that China shares its deep reservations and the U.S.-led international system and will act accordingly. Nevertheless, the last few years demonstrate how quickly assumptions can change. In America and the West, for example, most had assumed until 2008 and 2014 that Moscow would not dare to use force in the broadly defined territory of “Europe.” Today, by many contrast, many assume that Russia could be planning new military operations. At the same time, prior to the Ukraine crisis and despite rhetoric by senior leaders, Russia’s military force posture and deployments seemed to assume that armed conflict on Russia’s western borders was rather unlikely and that the greatest military threats lay elsewhere. This rapid change in assumptions illustrates two useful lessons. One — which is obvious but merits explicit recognition — is that unpredictable events can powerfully influence decision-making by global great powers. If Ukrainians had been somewhat less frustrated with their former President Viktor Yanukovych, the world could be a different place. This doesn’t mean that U.S.-Russian relations wouldn’t be tense, as the erosion of the reset began well before the Maidan protests. But it does mean that Western and Russian leaders might still be thinking differently about employing military power in central Europe. Another lesson is that capabilities can change more rapidly than expected and that changing capabilities can influence intentions. U.S. and Western policy toward Russia since the 1990s has assumed that Moscow’s relative weakness would constrain Russia’s foreign policy. Yet the surge in energy prices in the early twenty-first century facilitated rearmament programs and post-2008 reforms that dramatically increased Russia’s capabilities, expanded Moscow’s definition of its interests, and empowered Mr. Putin to advance those interests. Western perceptions of Russia’s power lagged behind these processes. Russian leaders have simultaneously held flawed assumptions about the constraints that U.S. and European leaders would face due to weak Western economies and frustrated publics. Thankfully, while the consequences of these mistakes have been serious, they have not yet become grave — while Russia has a large nuclear arsenal, its economy is quite small relative to America’s and particularly to the combined U.S. and European Union economies. Similarly, while Russia’s conventional military forces are powerful, especially compared to its western and southern neighbors, Moscow remains weak relative to the United States and NATO. Confronting them militarily would require making a very risky political bet. The question that American and Russian leaders should be asking themselves today is whether they hold any questionable assumptions about China. At the same time, they should consider how to improve the accuracy of Chinese assumptions about the United States and Russia. Misjudgments in the complex triangle between Washington, Beijing and Moscow could be quite costly for all concerned. Paul J. Saunders is executive director of the Center for the National Interest.

LONDON (AP) — It helps to have friends in high places when you’re promoting an athletic event. That’s certainly the case for Prince Harry, who released a video Friday promoting the upcoming Invictus Games for wounded veterans. The cast includes his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II as well as Barack and Michelle Obama, who Harry and his brother Prince William had over for dinner last week in London. The video starts with Harry and the queen looking at an Invictus brochure when they get a video phone message from Mrs. Obama. It shows the Obamas accepting Harry’s challenge to the Invictus Games, with a man in uniform behind them saying “Boom!” PHOTOS: Boom! Queen & Harry answer Obamas' Invictus Games challenge The queen, bemused by the Americans, says, “Oh really? Please.” Harry then says “Boom!” with a wicked grin.

Syrian settlement as a precondition for routing international terrorism
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION Six years ago this spring, the mass protest movement in the Middle East reached Syria. But the Syrian crisis, even though it is part of the disease that has affected the region, is somewhat different. Syria is the Arab ignition point where many wires of global confrontation of the early 21st century connect. The Syrian conflict has aggravated the fundamental Russia-West differences that developed over the change of governments in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and, recently, Ukraine. The Syrian conflict has highlighted new global and regional challenges, such as international terrorism and its obsolete caliphate ideology, waves of migrants sweeping across Europe, the use of chemical weapons for the first time since WWI, and growing Sunni-Shia hostility, echoing religious wars in Islam’s history. At this turning point in the development of the Middle East, Syria has become the battlefield of Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two leading centers of confrontation in the Muslim world. Because of alarming developments in Syria over the past five years, Russia-U.S. relations have changed several times. Initially, they waged fierce battles in the U.N. Security Council and at other international organizations on the issue of internationalizing the internal Syrian conflict. The West proposed resolutions that would have prodded events in Syria under the Libyan scenario and the external Syrian opposition pinned its hopes on this. In that difficult situation, Russia continued to insist on resolutions that comply with international law and did its best to prevent a military intervention. Direct military interference in Syria — not the same as Libya by a long way — would have resulted in the worst possible consequences for the region and the rest of the world. Over time, the political effects of the attempts to demonize Russia have fizzled out. As hostilities dragged out and Syria was rapidly turning into a breeding ground for international terrorism, Russia’s arguments sounded more and more rational. Shortly before she resigned as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton warned of “extremists” trying “to hijack the Syrian revolution.” This marked the transition to calmer and more businesslike discussions on the scale of challenges facing both Russia and the United States. But the gap between admitting certain facts and making concrete foreign policy conclusions was still very large. The United States and the European Union made a big mistake when they recognized the foreign group of Syrian opposition as the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and denounced the government of President Bashar Assad as illegal. This encouraged the ragtag opposition to believe in their military victory. But this also limited the U.S. ability for diplomatic maneuver and for influencing the opposition, including those armed opposition groups which were rapidly yielding to Saudi influence. Meanwhile, Russia maintained its realistic stance in the Syrian conflict, which was aimed at preventing the further destabilization and the possible spread of violence and destruction to neighboring countries. The Geneva Communique of June 30, 2012 created the foundation for intra-Syrian negotiations. But this potential was not realized at the Geneva conference in 2014. The Syrian National Council, a Syrian opposition coalition, was not fully prepared for the talks and kept advancing preliminary conditions. The Syrian government was overconfident and sometimes contemptuous of its negotiating partners, describing all of them as terrorists. It appears that at that time Russia overestimated Damascus’s abilities and gave it too much leeway. The failure of the second Geneva meeting was followed by a political lull period, although Russia more than once urged its American partners to back the provisions of the 2012 Geneva Communique with a U.N. Security Council resolution and to also engage a regional track. Meanwhile, fighting escalated and was becoming more violent. This increased violence almost ran out of control as it acquired a deadly dynamic of its own and nearly pushed the Syrian state to the verge of destruction. Mr. Assad’s secular government was about to be replaced by a motley crew of Islamic militants, who were managing to join forces in their fight to overthrow Mr. Assad despite their differences. Developments in Syria reached a critical moment by the fall of 2015. It became obvious that the regional partners of Russia and the United States were exploiting their masters’ differences in order to achieve their own goals in this dangerous game. Russia’s direct involvement in Syria and its call for creating a broad counterterrorist coalition boosted international coordination, no matter what form it assumed. The Russian Aerospace Forces’ operation in Syria helped balance internal forces, and this in turn created the right conditions for a joint search for compromise political solutions. Despite a crisis in their bilateral relations, Russia and the United States were the first to sense that the time was right for a cease-fire. By that time, they had also coordinated their approaches to the Syrian settlement. Russia and the United States agree on many fundamental issues, including that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict, that the Islamic State must be defeated and that Syrians themselves must negotiate the political future of their country with international assistance. They also agree that there is a direct link between reaching agreements in Syria and routing international terrorism. Russia and the United States stand for preserving Syria’s territorial integrity and for implementing political reforms that will not affect state institutions. In other words, the Syrian government should not be overthrown in the manner of Iraq and Libya, but should be reformed on the basis of national reconciliation. Another important element is that the ongoing efforts to restore peace must be based on international law, a stance which Russia has always advocated, including the joint statements that were adopted at the multilateral meetings in Vienna and formalized in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254. These documents include not just the guidelines for the settlement and subsequent rehabilitation of the Syrian state but also a detailed road map for a transition period. Moreover, the work of the International Syria Support Group now involves influential regional countries, including Iran. And lastly, the intra-Syrian talks are being held under conditions of a successful cease-fire, which appears to be holding. These positive trends in Syria are encouraging, but there are many problems ahead that can cut this fragile process short at any time. Provocations can be staged by the many armed groups that have not committed themselves to honor the cease-fire, primarily Jabhat al-Nusra, which is closely connected with some members of the so-called Riyadh Delegation at the Geneva talks. A settlement is also hindered by the fact that the external parties cannot agree on who should be considered terrorists and with whom they can discuss the future of the Syrian state. Obviously, Syria cannot remain as it was in 2011. But neither should it become an Islamic state based on a scenario that has been rejected in Egypt. Syria is one of the few Arab countries that has had a secular government for centuries. Can the jihadis actually attain politically the goals in Syria that they have not been able to attain militarily? The answer to this question can only be given in the course of negotiations. At the same time, the conflicting parties and regional players, on whom the Syrian opposition depends too strongly, can fail to correctly assess the military and political situation in Syria. After an agreement was reached on Iran’s nuclear program, Saudi Arabia abandoned its shadow diplomacy in favor of a more aggressive policy in the region, just at a time when the departing U.S. administration cannot seriously influence it. And for this reason Turkey may emerge as the spoiler. And lastly, Damascus’s actions are not entirely predictable. It has attempted to violate the international agreements sealed in Resolution 2254, for example by setting parliamentary elections for April 14 and by announcing plans both for early presidential elections and for the drafting a new constitution. Under the international agreements that have been reached, these issues must be coordinated during the intra-Syrian talks and should be overseen by a transitional government. Nevertheless, there is a degree of optimism regarding the mission of the U.N.-appointed international intermediary, Staffan de Mistura. There is hope that he can enjoy greater success than his predecessors, especially if he relies on international support further backed by U.S.-Russian mutual understanding and close military-political coordination. Only by settling the Syrian crisis will the international community be able to focus on routing international terrorism at the heart of the Arab world. ⦁ Alexander Aksenyonok, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, is an expert in Arab studies, a member of the Expert Council of the Federation Council’s International Affairs Committee, and a member of the Russian International Affairs Council.

Russia, the U.S. and a great power peace in Syria
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION The Middle East has been a source of significant security problems whose obvious manifestations are terrorism and extremism. Several factors feed this trend: the crisis of Islamic civilization arising from disagreements over cause of decline since its peak a millennium ago; the sectarianism-fueled rivalry between the three main regional actors—Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey; rising ethnic Kurdish nationalism, and the divergent views of current and rising global powers regarding the region’s future, and in turn their backing of rival regional powers. The Syrian civil war is a stark example of these dynamics. Although Russia has withdrawn much of its forces from Syria, it continues to support the Assad regime with arms and diplomacy.  Despite increased engagement between Moscow and Washington, the gap between U.S. and Russian views on Assad and other issues such as Ukraine are exacerbating the broader great power relations and sectarian divisions of the Middle East, which in turn are fanning Syria’s civil war.  How Russia and the U.S. manage their differences on Syria will be an important test of whether they can cooperate in facilitating a more stable order in the region. What does Russia want in the Middle East? I gained some insights into this question during my tenure as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 2008-2009 – a period that coincided with a series of aggressive steps by Russia.  Over long conversations with my counterpart, Vitaly Churkin, I concluded that Moscow in fact felt threatened by many of the same concerns animating U.S. policy, such as regional rivalry, sectarian conflict and state collapse.  Russia also feared a regional order in which normalizations of relations between regional states and the U.S. would come at Russia’s expense.  Russia concluded that hostility between the Middle Eastern states and the West was an acceptable if imperfect status quo. While I do not think Russia’s fundamental orientation toward the region has changed, the Syrian situation, in my view, has deteriorated to the point that a new U.S.-Russian understanding cannot be ruled out. The key to securing genuine Russian cooperation on Syria is for the U.S. to make a broader diplomatic push, not only to end the Syrian crisis, but also to facilitate a broader regional understanding and promote common concepts that stabilize the region and also safeguard legitimate Russian interests. The fundamental solution is to promote a regional balance of power, strengthen moderate states, and undertake with Russia the heavy lifting of fostering an internal political settlement in Syria. The U.S. can show Russia and other regional actors that it does not have a stake in the overall sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias by expanding relations with all states that are backing sectarian forces, including Iran.  Concurrently, the U.S. will need to strengthen the military capabilities of the Gulf States to ensure that there is a balance of power in the region.  Only then will Saudi Arabia, Turkey and its Sunni allies have the confidence to move toward far-reaching negotiations with Iran or Russia. Just as the religious wars of Europe eventually provided an impetus for a rules-based order through the Westphalian system, Washington and Moscow should deliberate on whether talks to end the Syrian stalemate might lay the groundwork for a broader architecture for the region. Above all, Washington and Moscow should jointly press for regional powers to accept three points: ·      A principle of mutual acceptance, resolving that the beliefs of all Muslims are equally valid·      A program to promote unity and end sectarian conflicts·      A commitment to cooperate on common practical challenges such as freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. A new Middle Eastern understanding could allow the U.S. and Russia to steer regional dialogue toward an internal political settlement in Syria.  The key is for regional players to think through power-sharing arrangements, with buy-in from all of the major communities, that can create durable peace.  Decentralized, federal or even confederal arrangements – in which the national government has limited functions and each community governs areas where its people predominate – would likely work best. The status of the Kurdish region in Iraq, which has its own laws and security forces, but participates fully in the national government, might be a model to protect the Alawites, preserve Russian bases and give Moscow enough confidence to abandon Assad. To facilitate such an agreement among the regional parties, the U.S. and Russia should work within the Security Council to convene a conference of all competing local groups and regional allies.  A precedent for that is the 2001 Bonn conference, where Washington and Moscow overcame their pre-9/11 differences on Afghanistan and catalyzed agreement on a post-Taliban government for the country. The time has come for the U.S. and Russia to understand that the civilization crisis in the Middle East is a problem every bit as large as those faced by Europe and East Asia in the darkest periods of the 20th century.  If the world’s powers do not undertake the work of normalizing the Middle East, the externalities of the region’s conflicts will impose an enormous cost on the U.S. and Russia alike.

Russian ambassador sees U.S. ties at post-Cold War low

Russia’s top diplomat in the U.S. said in a briefing with reporters Monday that relations between Washington and Moscow are in “a deplorably difficult state” and have fallen in recent years to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. “The dialogue we used to have has slowed down significantly,” Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador in Washington said, during a rare roundtable discussion with reporters on Monday. “We were able to end the Cold War, but most probably we weren’t able to build post-Cold War peace,” he said. “We’ve failed to create a real tissue of our relations and that makes these relations very, very vulnerable.” But in wide-ranging comments, the Russian ambassador rejected the idea that a new kind of Cold War is in the offing. “We ought to work together and we are perfectly open to doing so,” he said. At the same time, he accused the Obama administration and the U.S. military of mischaracterizing Russia as an aggressor and adversary that needs to be isolated on the world stage. He said relations began breaking down well before Washington and Moscow took opposing sides over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and pointed to NATO’s years-long expansion in Eastern Europe and Washington’s support for it as the top catalyst for friction between the two nations. “We see the expansion of military infrastructure of NATO moving closer to our borders,” he said.

Russia-U.S. mutual investments have a future 
.B
The argument that Russia-U.S. trade and economic relations have no solid foundation has long since become commonplace. However, such statements are far from reality. Our business cooperation still has a certain base, since for many years we’ve been a major importer of U.S. grain and poultry, and these factors have always weighed in on our political relations. Even now, despite a significant drop in bilateral trade, there are several areas that haven’t been affected by the sanctions, and where our cooperation is fairly broad. The aviation industry is one such example. Russia is the largest supplier of titanium to Boeing and Airbus. In addition, Russia is a significant market for Boeing aircraft, both used and new. Regarding titanium, we have recently moved from supplying raw titanium to exporting titanium parts and components, which brought our partnership to a new level. We have good ties in metallurgy, which include not only Russian supplies of steel blanks to the United States, but also ​​investments. Russian companies buying US assets have opened doors to cooperation in the sphere of manufacturing high-quality pipes that are used, among other things, for producing shale oil and in other projects. Space exploration is a traditional sphere of our relations. Let’s not forget that Russia and the United States top the world in this sphere. Not surprisingly, this area of our cooperation was not affected by the sanctions. This also applies to supplying Russian space engines to the United States and ISS cooperation. In addition, negotiations are underway to launch commercial satellites using Russian booster rockets. Such American business juggernauts as Ford and General Electric are heavily invested in Russia. Unfortunately, some U.S. companies have decided to shut down their operations in our country, also because of the crisis on the Russian automobile market. However, I think that U.S. investments in Russia and Russian investments in the United States have good prospects. In general, even though the sanctions have held back Russia-U.S. cooperation, they haven’t curtailed it. On the one hand, a serious blow was dealt to promising projects related to non-conventional oil sources. On the other hand, American business can still return to these projects if sanctions are lifted. I believe that the key Russian companies will be willing to revive these projects under different circumstances. Sanctions against the Russian financial sector hit its key actors, such as Sberbank, VTB and Vnesheconombank, and are an important factor. Lifting the sanctions, including in the sphere of ​​finance, would facilitate resetting relations between Russia and the United States, which Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state and leading Democratic Party presidential candidate, mentioned a few days ago. For us, a reset is, in fact, an opportunity to return to normal relations, not gain access to some preferential mode of partnership and cooperation. Although, as I mentioned earlier, we remain key partners in space and aviation. I can see an objection coming. Some may argue that even when our relations were “normal,” the volume of trade and economic cooperation between our countries was fairly modest. However, several factors need to be taken into account. First, if you take the size of the Russian economy, it is 10 times smaller than the Chinese economy. This explains the significantly smaller volume of our mutual trade. Second, the European Union has always been our key partner. Also, let’s not forget about the quality factor: our partnership covers strategic areas, such as the aviation, the aerospace and the nuclear industry. It remains to be seen whether Russia can in the future become a partner of the United States in multilateral U.S. trade and investment initiatives, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that Russia can join the TPP if it wants. It’s premature to discuss prospects and forms of Russia’s participation in it, as these projects were designed without Russia in mind. However, we have solid and deep relations with many countries that have become parties to the TPP, including, in addition to Japan and South Korea, Vietnam, with which we have recently signed a free-trade zone agreement. Russia is interested in expanding mutual trade and contacts, not creating new barriers. The policy of “turning to the East” recently proclaimed by Moscow does not mean that we are turning away from the West. Of course, the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine led to a major reformatting of our relations with the European Union and the United States. However, no matter what disputes or conflicts we may have, we must work together to come up with development models that would really bring our nations closer despite our differences. We need to cooperate to promote development, not enmity or forceful imposition of values. In closing, the economy may have been victimized by politics, but it can still be a foundation for promoting political cooperation. ⦁ Andrei Klepach is chief economist of Vnesheconombank.

Putting Metro back on track
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Paul Wiedefeld, the man hired to put the D.C., Maryland and Virginia mass transit system back on track, delivered a three-pronged plan Thursday to begin the long arduous process. The proposal is simple: Spend and squirrel away money for capital needs, spend money to fix today’s and tomorrow’s operating needs, and spend money to maintain the system. The total cost of the proposal is $15.5 billion over 10 years. It also would pull from federal, state and local coffers, as public transit systems do. Of course, where Metro’s money comes from and how it’s spent are part-and-parcel of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The District, where Metro is headquartered, has its financial and political needs, as do Maryland and Virginia. For example, each jurisdiction has non-Metro mass transit needs to tend to, especially Amtrak, and commuter and private rail and bus lines. Maryland also has Baltimore’s urban systems, and Marc and feeder rail, and local and regional bus systems. Virginia is similar, having to consider Virginia Railway Express, a handful of local bus systems, and five individual public transit bus systems. Meanwhile, D.C. officials also spend public funds on the Circulator bus system and the D.C. Streetcar, a light-rail that rolls only along a portion of H Street NE. In addition, D.C., Maryland and Virginia transportation wallets have to reckon with Amtrak, our nation’s public choo-choo train, which always needs tokens from the federal coffer. Mr. Wiedefeld’s Metro plan does not take all of the above into consideration, but it is nonetheless practical because it offers opportunities for federal and state transit officials to plan — something politicians are often hesitant to do. The Wiedefeld plan includes: • Labor reform: Metro would outsource some jobs and cut its own workforce. This is smart business sense in Virginia, a right-to-work state and home to Metro’s under-construction Silver Line in Northern Virginia. Mr. Wiedefeld also wants new Metro workers to participate in a 401(k)-like program. Metro’s chief union is not pleased, to say the least. ATU 689 called the overall plan “bad for riders, bad for workers and bad for the region,” and (to no one’s surprise) it took special exception to outsourcing jobs. As things stand, Metro is facing a $1 billion unfunded pension liability, as well as $1.8 billion in other retiree benefits. Metro clearly needs to consider a new business model for its overall fiscal health as more and more unions push for minimum-wage increases. • Funding: Tax-and-spend is the cog in the Wiedefeld plan for the outyears. Some supporters want a regional sales tax, some want a tax on transit-oriented properties that developers would pay. It’s still a tax, and neither Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe nor Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is in the mood to raise taxes. The tax-and-spend gimmick for Metro’s outyears is called a dedicated funding source, and it may be a low rate at the outset, but rest assured it will never be enough to satisfy the needs of Metro. There are, however, politicians, such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who already have blessed such public pickpocketing. Mr. Kaine is “open to any solutions that meet the main criteria of ensuring a reliable funding source and making positive changes to safety and governance.” Mr. Wiedefeld, whose plan includes other funding proposals, is a smart enough political haymaker to know he’s got to please most of the people most of the time. He’s also smart enough to know that while Metro is indeed the backbone our region’s mass transit network, it is but one link in our regional transportation system. Metro used to be D.C.-centric, but no more. Putting Metro back on track means board members must view the system through different lenses as they weigh the 10-year, $15.5 billion proposal. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com.

D.C. budget needs these 3 things
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: The opening salvos on D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s fiscal 2018 spending plan were frighteningly tame, considering there’s nothing on the chopping block, nothing bolstering parents’ cries for school choice and nothing that declares a war on strenuous oversight. Seems the Bowser plan is begging for a fight. If members of the D.C. Council want to prove themselves worthy of being labeled lawmakers and not rubber stampers, here’s what they must do: 1) Prove support for the city’s young people by boosting per-pupil spending in public charter and traditional schools. The city’s public school’s chief, Antwan Wilson, said he is “confident that we have what we need.” That’s baloney. The mayor’s own advisers recommended a 3.5 percent increase, but the proposal she released on Tuesday came in at 1.5 percent, which means the kids, through no fault of their own, draw the short straw. Explains Ramona Edelin, executive director of the D.C. Association for Chartered Public Schools: “Half of District public school students are defined as ‘at risk.’ Nearly three-quarters live in economically disadvantaged homes — almost 80 percent in D.C.’s charters. The District’s tax base and public school enrollment are expanding, so must its investment in D.C.’s children.” Bazinga! 2) Stop the streetcar project in its tracks. This is a hard line, for sure, but the city and the Trump administration could save millions (reportedly $280 million) by focusing on the needs of motorists and Metro instead of progressive pipe dreams. Mary Cheh, the council’s Transportation Committe chair; Charles Allen, the Ward 6 rep, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao should engage in a triple-threat match: Hop onto the streetcar near Union Station (in the dark of night) and ride it to tracks’ end in nowhere land (in the dark of night). (I’m willing to wager they’d call Uber and Lyft in the name of safety.) The streetcar project is a waste of public dollars, public resources and public planning. Junk it now, and focus on meaningful projects, such as moving residents, truckers and buses from Point A to Point B without being jammed by gridlock. 3) Beef up oversight. Lawmakers must remember this: It is their job to legislate and dispose and it’s the mayor’s job to execute and propose. When neither branch performs its lawful responsibilities, accountability disappears — and that’s where the city stands right now. Surely all programs for D.C. stakeholders are not effective and efficient. The council should investigate as much. For example, are so-called workforce programs actually training and hiring D.C. residents? No. D.C. unemployment rates are staggering in Wards 7 and 8, 10 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively. Put another way, lawmakers must stop allowing the mayor’s crew and their advocates from merely saying “We served X amount people during fiscal year such and such.” Poppycock. Oversight means asking the tough questions and getting reliable data to explain to stakeholders precisely how agencies and nonprofits spent taxpayer money. Think of it this way, too: If lawmakers do their job, the mayor would be forced to do the same. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com.

D.C. parking, red-light ticket sham
.B
Hip, hip, hooray! D.C. officials want to give folks who get parking and red-light tickets a break. Well, some folks. And, well, a measure of a financial break. Oh, and it’s a sham, too. So, a celebration is not in order. The facts first: The D.C. Council is considering legislation that would exempt residents from fines on certain traffic tickets, such as those that double in parking tickets, speeding tickets and red-light running tickets. (A breather for sure.) The legislation, titled the Traffic and Parking Ticket Penalty Amendment Act of 2017, means that if a, say, $300 speeding ticket isn’t paid within the 30-day grace period and is paid, say, 10 days late, the ticket would not double to $600. Introduced by freshman Council member Trayon White, bill 22-0204 also would not exempt commuters in neighboring Maryland and Virginia, nor residents of other states who motor into the nation’s capital for work. Tourists who drive themselves or rent cars would not be exempt either. For sure, the rollback in ticket fines is a poke in eye to Maryland and Virginia in the name of a commuter tax. Understand, the city is not permitted to levy a commuter tax for tending to other states’ residents who tend to their jobs in the city. Indeed, the genesis of the District’s convoluted anti-parking apparatus was designed in the 1970s to sock it to commuters anyway. The so-called residential parking permit, which residents who own vehicles have to pay annually to park on their own block, is a perfect example of the parking Nazis’ policy reasoning. That’s why it’s so daggum interesting that one of the explanations for the exemption is that poor people cannot afford it. “The average person in D.C., especially in Wards 7, 8 and 5 and parts of [Ward] 4 don’t have extra money to give to the government.” Well, neither does the ordinary working schmo who’s living on minimum wages or a fixed income, or a college student who lives on $1 cups of caffeine from Mickey D’s and Ramen noodles from Family Dollar. What’s more, D.C. Council members decades ago exempted themselves from parking tickets. (There are extreme circumstances, such as a council member growling at Fido over a fire hydrant.) And here’s another rub: The real scam is that how in the Dickens going to exempt a driver from the doubling of a red-light, parking or speeding ticket when the vehicle — not the driver — is the offender? Is the city going to ask that we plaster our driver’s license and insurance cards on our rear windshields so cameras can snap them, too? The sanctuary from the city’s anti-driving Nazis should be given to the D.C.-registered vehicle and the D.C.-licensed motorist. When and if city officials can get with that program, an update will be in order. Until then, this, too, is worth repeating: Nobody has “extra money” to give to the D.C. government.

Our children are starving — for food, for protection, for parents, for hope.
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Our children are starving — for food, for protection, for parents, for hope. There are all kinds of public service announcements, commercials and efforts urging us to help feed hungry children and their families. In all, a record 70 million are in need of one of life’s necessities — food. We can argue and debate until the cows (don’t) come home about why we’re allowing our children to starve, but that won’t change the bottom line that we are facing the broadest and deepest global humanitarian crisis since the United Nations was established in 1945. Indeed, an estimated 100,000 people in South Sudan are dying of starvation and 7.5 million South Sudanese need food. Moreover, their hunger pains have spread to the lands of their neighbors, including Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia, where another 16 million people are at risk of starving in the coming months. Closer to home, DoSomething.org says 49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table, and Central Americans say they are undernourished and starved because of the quadruple threats of civil war, violence, politics and poverty. Children, mostly through no fault of their own, always get jammed in the crossfire, eh? Consider, the teens who attend Rockville High School in Montgomery County. Rockville High is a traditional school in one of the wealthiest county’s in America. Yet despite the metal detectors, electronic surveillance and other peepers in the school, a young girl was raped inside the school and another was beaten inside the school because the grownups weren’t doing what they were supposed to do — protecting their charges. The schoolhouse violence was incomparable to the kidnapping and rape of the school girls in Nigeria. Remember that headline grabber in 2014? About 270 girls at Chibok school in northeastern Nigeria, and while it’s certainly good news that scores of them are now accounted for, 195 have yet to return. Missing children. Quelle horreur! Scores of children and adults have been reported missing in America’s capital, and the kids’ disappearances are treated like a political football. When it comes to missing children in D.C., the numbers don’t lie. Officials spin the news, for certain, saying there is no uptick in missing kids, when statistics provided by the Metropolitan Police Department prove the exact opposite. Under the heading “Currently Open Cases,” the MPD website says there were no juvenile critical cases in 2012 and 2013, there was one in 2014, none in 2015, and three in 2016. But in 2017, there are already 14. That is an uptick. As for non-critical juvenile cases, there were none in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 or 2016. So far in 2017, there are three. That is an uptick. There was one adult critical case each year in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. There have been six so far this year. That is an uptick. As for adult non-critical cases, there were none in 2012 and 2013, one in 2014 and one in 2015, two in 2016, but eight so far this year. Of all those cases, 31 remain open as of Thursday — one from 2012 and 2013, three from 2014, two from 2015 and six from 2016. That, too, is an uptick. In its eagerness to push solutions to a growing problem, the Bowser administration patted itself on the back with a six-point missing persons initiative and a letter to members of the Congressional Black Caucus extolling its position as a national leader on preventing young people from running away from home. If there were such a preventive measure, the late Dr. Benjamin Spock, a leading authority on children and family dynamics, would have patented and bottled it, and we’d be mandating that adolescents and teens continue to suckling at that teat. As it is, children have become after thoughts when it comes to parenting them, protecting them and feeding them because we have turned those responsibilities over to governments and nongovernmental groups.

Banita Jacks tragedy illustrates shortcomings of government ‘home visit’ policies
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Jan. 9, 2008: U.S. marshals knock at the door of a house in Southeast D.C. at about 9:30 a.m. A woman in a white T-shirt lets them in. She sits on the steps, and the marshals are hit with a stench. While minding the woman, they discover something upstairs even more overwhelming than the odor. Four corpses. Young corpses. The woman’s daughters. SEE ALSO: D.C. residents baffled by lack of attention over missing children The mother, Banita Jacks, said they “died” in their sleep. They were “possessed” by demons. “I am not insane.” Those comments are among the most compelling facts in the Jacks case, a stunning murder that practically left D.C. Superior Judge Frederick Weisberg few choices in 2009 but to convict her with several repetitions of “guilty.” Nobody was peeking under her bed or the girls’ bed. Nobody peeked into the fridge to see if it was stocked with fruits and veggies. Lots of folks knocked, got no answer and simply walked away. Chalk it up to liberal roads leading to Satan’s place. The Jacks case left the public-at-large asking variations of the same question, “What in Hell went wrong?” — a question that government and social services advocates rarely answer truthfully. They’d rather try to legislate an issue away or rewrite policy than solve a real problem. Consider the D.C. missing girls crisis. Mayor Muriel Bowser and her political cohorts say there is no “crisis,” yet on Friday her political cohorts (and some members of the media) saluted her for establishing a task force and other initiatives on missing children. Oy vey. Today, nine years after the discovery of those decomposing corpses, the question is, “What is going right?” The short government answer is not enough, according to a just-released report by D.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson. According to the report, there’s not enough personnel, there’s not enough funding and there’s not enough, well, tack on any noun you prefer. Without doubt, the auditor’s report will help rejuvenate interest in policies now being bungled as “home visit.” The policies are a throwback to old-school health, education and welfare programs that urged and even mandated that case workers peer into families’ homes to check on everybody’s health, education and welfare. (These days, they can snatch blood samples and DNA along the way.) Will the “home visits” solve Americans’ problems or create new problems? Well, both. However, because the laws, the rules and the regs were one-size-fits-all, they also discouraged single parents from dating or remarrying, and they gave families a false since of security (with other policies like summer youth jobs, free-style abortion, public housing “projects” and affordable housing). (Google the word Negro and the name Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the same time and read for yourself.) Would a bolstered “home visit” program have saved Banita Jacks and her four girls? That is doubtful. See, in the Jacks case, housing folks did not intervene, social services did not intervene, police did not intervene, school authorities did not intervene, neighbors did not intervene, family did not intervene. Even her public utilities were shut off. They all knocked on the door for a “home visit.” Nobody answered, but each could say they had visited the home. Seemingly, everyone suspected something wasn’t quite right after Jacks‘ husband died of cancer in early 2007. One problem, a huge one, is that mayors, lawmakers, advocates, school authorities, social service/welfare agencies and law enforcers are designed to operate in their own silos. Nobody aggregates. (Hence, no missing girl crisis.) That D.C. tentacles reached deeply into every aspect of the Jacks family is a testament to them becoming prisoners as reclusive as their mom and the blind ambition of government overreach. That the District is considering making its “home visit” policy anew regarding infants, children and parents (who may live separately) is frightening enough. To label them all “at-risk” is a terrifying prospect. To peep first and ask questions later would be not only an invasion of privacy but also racial and socio-economic profiling of the first order. Sure, the sick and the shut-ins need to be checked on sometimes. But that’s not who the government wants to target. The government and its health, education and welfare advocates played an awful, awful hoax on Banita Jacks‘ girls and, frankly, their mom. Don’t let the government leave its fingerprints all over your family like it did the Jacks girls. Sometimes, when the government comes a knockin’ • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Bad news on minimum wage front
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Well, the results are in: D.C. residents are going to be whacked by the minimum-wage bully stick. The  wage increases begin kicking in on July 1 and by the time they hit the  $15 mark in 2021 new analyses offer several apolitical realities,  projections that should have been highlighted during legislative and  City Hall deliberations. Here’s the reality of the crapper situation from none other than the D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer. 1) D.C. residents lose jobs because out-of-staters, i.e. commuters, already have the upper hand. “The commuter  effect is the main reason that DC residents will lose 82% of all jobs  lost in DC due to the minimum wage increase. Our model predicts by the  year 2026, 2,489 total jobs will be lost, with 2,046 of those jobs  previously being held by DC residents. Without the commuter effect, our  model still estimates that there would be job losses as businesses and  consumers react to changes in prices due to the minimum wage increase,  but the commuter effect concentrates the losses on DC residents.” 2) Who wins, who loses? “Most of the impacted District  residents (those earning between $8.25 and $18) will see an increase in  their wages over the baseline of up to $5,100 in 2021 (one year after  the policy hits the $15 per hour mark). “About 1,200, or 2% of the 61,000  residents, however, may face job loss by 2021. This number increases to  (and caps out) at around 2,000, or 3.4%, by 2026.”For all DC residents impacted by the  minimum wage policy (including those who lose their job), net total  earnings in the city increase by about $140 million in 2021.  There’s  about $190 million generated in new earnings by the higher wage, but $40  million is offset by those who lose their jobs and another $12 million  is lost by those earning above the minimum wage who see a slight  slowdown in subsequent wage growth as employers try to shift some of the  new, higher labor costs.” So the next time elected  D.C. officials start spewing the benefits of higher minimum wages,  remind them for whom the ka-ching tolls. Oh, and that next time is imminent as City Hall ponders rolling back tax cuts. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

D.C.’s missing children
.B
That’s  the take comic-commentator D.L. Hughley tweeted Monday morning  after he learned that scores of D.C. children have gone missing this year. Humanizing the  victims and the need for urgent law enforcement action have become the  driving force in the city of late. Indeed, some members of the D.C.  faith-based community see it as an affront for Mayor Muriel Bowser and  newly minted Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham to deny there is an  uptick in missing kids. That the media played along is unfortunate as  well. Sure, they’re interested  in getting the statistical facts about missing persons cases, but they  also want to know what can be done to drive the numbers down and what  can be done to solve open cases. The overwhelming majority of young  D.C. victims are black and brown, and many of the very people drawing  attention to these crimes suspect human trafficking for sex to be the  crime. But don’t be lulled by city leaders who gloss over the burning issues: What can be done to drive the numbers  down of missing children and what can be done to solve open cases? Sure, Mr. Hughley made an easily dismissible tweet, but we cannot ignore the fact that there is a missing children crisis in our mist — and that’s evident because we’ve been told there is not.

School rape case raises important questions
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Much of the heated discussion about America and its immigration laws turns on Hispanics and Muslims, and people with Hispanic-sounding names and Muslim-sounding names. Let’s look at an issue that also is worthy of serious deliberation. SEE ALSO: White House: Md. school rape underscores Trump’s compassion for victims of illegal immigrant crimes Are people who they claim to be? Who are these people who make it into the United States? Do they come here with legitimate identification? Or do we “legitimize” them after they arrive? Those are the most significant questions following a recent rape at a Maryland high school. SEE ALSO: Rape at Maryland high school stirs up debate on sanctuary cities The immigration-related headlines behind the case are zingers, and rightly so considering the incident happened during school hours inside the school house. In short, a ninth-grader at Rockville High School in Montgomery County said two schoolmates hustled her into a boys’ restroom Thursday morning and took turns holding her down and raping her inside a stall. The girl is 14 years old, and the boys are 17 and 18. While we hope the girl is OK and on her way toward healing, Maryland and Montgomery County education authorities have many questions to answer. • Who exactly is 18-year-old Henry E. Sanchez? He reportedly is from Guatemala, but how do school authorities know that Henry is who he says he is? It’s unbelievably easy to determine if immigrants or wannabe immigrants are who they propose to be: Mandate photo IDs, and federal, state and local government verification every step of the way. I appreciate, for sure, the fear of an apartheid system potentially being established here in America. However, I also appreciate that the push to allow anyone and everyone to enjoy our freedom-loving customs can blind some Americans. (Even driver’s licenses, non-driver state IDs and lease agreements “legitimize” the undeserving.) • Who exactly is 17-year-old Jose O. Montano? This is the boy the girl knew. Leave it to law enforcement to grill Jose on why he targeted her and whether any other Rockville girls or boys have fallen victim. In the meantime, parents and county and state school officials should be in for a grilling. • Who directed Jose and Henry to Rockville High? Who handled their enrollment? Have Rockville teachers met their parents? Do they have siblings? All those questions (and a few others, of course) are critical in determining how public schools handle enrollment from here forward — and this is especially so because A) both Henry and Jose have only been in the states since 2016, and 2) they’ve been enrolled in Rockville High since 2016, and 3) Henry reportedly lives in Aspen Hill, where the median household income for was $75,014, and for a family was $81,474. Here’s another reason why we have to better mind the locks and the keys: Last week at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, a U.S citizen trying to enter from Tijuana was delayed when U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities checked the trunk of his car and — bam! — four Chinese people were found hogtied and crammed in the trunk like they were being sent to market. The driver, the three women and one man were taken into custody thanks to the canines who sniffed out the human-trafficking scent. While hound dogs oftentimes get a bad rap for being too lazy, America cannot afford to allow our school authorities to be lackadaisical when it comes to safety and making sure that students and teachers are who they say they are. Schools are not sanctuaries. They are teaching and learning institutions. And it takes more than merely allowing someone to claim their name is Henry or Jose than simply handing over pieces of paper saying as much. To be sure, the federal authorities knew Henry’s name was linked to an “alien removal” and he shouldn’t even had been in Rockville High on Thursday. A judge agreed for most part. “I believe that you are a danger,” District Judge Eugene Wolfe declared. School authorities should take their blinders off: Metal detectors do not scan for fraud. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com.

3 things: Trump’s education spending plan
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION Did President Trump really take a “meat cleaver” to federal education spending, as American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said? Or did Mr. Trump, after becoming president, consider the hand that states, localities and parents had been dealt and deliver a blueprint that returns the power and authority to them? Mr. Trump did not end programs. He ended federal funding for some programs. States and local authorities can continue programs they deem worthy. They just won’t get the federal money. That smart move alone will force state and local leaders to do what state and local had been doing long before there ever was a Cabinet-level Department of Education. So cast aside the union leader’s opinion. Facts speak louder than hyperbole. 1) Mr. Trump’s proposal does not whack the Department of Education’s roughly $68 billion budget. It does, however, scrap federal funding of some programs, trim funding for some and bolster funding for others. For example, teacher-quality federal spending, along with its federal red tape, could be out. A $2.4 billion program, the grants program touching on everything from teacher prep programs to hiring, recruiting and training high-quality teachers. Should a rural school district in Wyoming have to move in lockstep with a highly urban one like New York City regarding its teaching corps? No. What’s good for the NYC goose could prove to be an oil slick. 2) All jurisdictions face a possible loss of so-called impact aid money, the $66 million federal pot of money used to offset tax revenues that some communities face because they are home to federal property. This is a tricky one, as the federal government occupies nooks and crannies everywhere. Expect push backs from Congress and state capitals. 3) School choice finally gets the federal attention its parents and other supporters deserve. As expected, Mr. Trump wants to bolster education options via the portability factor. Military personnel, college students and people in need of government housing do it all the time. Section 8 vouchers, for example, can first be used in a tony D.C. neighborhood, then follow the recipient if they move to a different neighborhood. And the public money does not have to be used for “public” housing. The Trump education plan specifically pitches $1.4 billion for school choice, including $18 million for charter schools, a new pot of $250 million for children to enroll in private and religious schools, and funding for disadvantaged students would bump up from $15 billion to $16 million. Of course, the downside to Mr. Trump entire plan is congressional add-ons, such as the possibility that status-quo seat holders won’t shake lose of progressive’s passive-aggressive habits and that liberal’s tendencies will pile on rewrites and amendments to please their anti-choice advocates who love to preach to the soapbox choir. To wit, the hyperbole from the teachers union. Libertarians, by the way, are not waving the pom-poms on the Trump proposal, and that’s understandable. For some lawmakers, even conservative ones, guidelines should be guideposts which then should become federal mandates — and therein lies the risk of hyperbole becoming reality.

D.C. can’t get the housing thing right
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: ANALYSIS/OPINION: D.C. needs to look at projects like the makeover of Brookland Manor Apartments to reform its housing stock. D.C. has fallen to the bottom of the housing barrel, and cannot expect the Trump budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help the city to market. The predicament is one part false expectations, one part political rhetoric, one part mismanagement and one part lack of oversight. Indeed, as D.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson explained Thursday afternoon, the D.C. Housing Production Trust Fund was set up with taxpayers’ dollars in 2001 to provide loans to companies that would create affordable housing for low-income seniors and others. But fund keepers failed to ensure that tenants’ income met the threshold and that owners/managers adhered to the rules and regulations. The audit came to light after D.C. Council member Kenyan McDuffie introduced legislation titled the Family Unit Amendment Act of 2017. The bill would refocus affordable housing efforts to ensure families are regarded by mandating a biennial report on the District’s need for three-, four- and five-bedroom apartment units and requiring that at least 10 percent of rental units created via the Housing Production Trust Fund be set aside for families instead of single people. Both the legislation and the audit follow Part Two of the predicament, which includes Democratic mayoral candidate Muriel Bowser pledging to boost affordable housing. Well, D.C. never was floating at the top of the barrel, and it’s sunk further down she took office in January 2015. What’s worse is, not only are the folks hired to mind the piggy bank not paying attention but the council, which has legislative oversight, isn’t either. It’s an unconscionable state of affairs for taxpayers, who are disappointed with elected leaders’ failure to effectively and efficiently deliver. Why the government should not be a housing producer should be obvious: 1) Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal locked generations of Americans into housing “projects” that have since been torn down or remain blighted. 2) The idealists’ notion of those failed “projects” remains the guiding light of politicians who buy into governments creating more “affordable” housing. It is the job of local elected officials to deliver to the people they work for, which means the elected officials must listen to those people to determine how to spend public dollars, when to spend public dollars and on what they propose to spend public dollars. We need to rethink “housing.” It’s a word that means different things to different people. For the rich and famous, it entails, well, more than the average U.S. homeowner or apartment dweller can imagine. For many others, it simply means a roof over their and their families’ heads. For others, unfortunately, it means braving the outdoors and Mother Nature’s tender mercies. The problem isn’t those housing situations. The problem is what happens when the adjective “affordable” is thrown into the housing equation and the poor are categorized as “low income,” “very low income” and “extremely low income.” Poor people will always be among us, and making sure that they can have a roof over their heads would be far easier if D.C. leaders wouldn’t try to fit a circular housing peg into the federal government’s square coffers, which are covered with endless streams of regulars and rhetoric like “extremely” poor. Oh, wait. The newly released Trump spending proposal might help solve the District’s problem. The president has proposed to end HUD’s Community Development Block Grant. The possible loss of the federal money should force D.C. officials to look at Brookland Manor because the redevelopment also could solve another predicament — the one of great expectations of residents who think and sometimes demand that they are due a right of return to the new program. And while the federal Community Development Block Grant money doesn’t flow into all housing projects, it certainly has been flowing freeing into the city’s piggy banks. Guess it’s back to square one. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Sanctuary cities are new Underground Railroad
.B
You’ve surely heard of sanctuary cities and sanctuary houses of worship, places where law enforcers generally tread lightly. Well, welcome a cottage industry: sanctuary homes. Many of the homes are in sanctuary cities like Los Angeles and are being purchased to hide and protect illegal and undocumented immigrants and their families from federal law enforcers. The network is organized by religious leaders. In one such home, the premises are being prepared for three families. In another, a Jewish man recently told CNN he has set up a bedroom in his own home to not only hide undocumented aliens but to secure himself as well, since the Fourth Amendment grants protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The man said he would not voluntarily allow immigration into his home but he would comply with a warrant. This new network is mindful in one sense of the Underground Railroad that William Still helped to conduct and lead black slaves and freed African Americans to the “promised land.” His chronicle during the 19th century aided in connecting and reconnecting families along the immense secretive network once they reached safety. The latter-day network also is aligned with the wrenching 20th century story of young German diarist Anne Frank, who, along with her family, had to hide from the Jew-killing Nazis. The anti-Trump fear factor leads the way today. This despite the fact that God-fearing state and local authorities could risk losing millions in federal funds that actually benefit illegal and legal immigrants alike, including public safety and housing programs.

The Donald Trump bathrobe thing
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION: Does  President Trump wear a bathrobe in the White House? Does he even own a  bathrobe? Do you even care? Should you care? Why ask? Well, the ongoing Trump-New York Times fake news feud stirred the brew anew on Monday after the Gray Lady published this on Sunday: “Usually around 6:30 p.m., or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs  to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With  his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is  almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his  imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When  Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone  reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set  off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.” Leave it to White House press secretary Sean Spicer to respond and take issue with the bathrobe thing. “I  don’t think the president owns a bathrobe,” Mr. Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. “He definitely  doesn’t wear one.” Quelle horreur? Not really. There are alternatives when Mr. Trump lumbers about the executive mansion. He could wear his “street clothes.” He could simply move about in his underwear (leaving interested parties to ask “boxers or briefs?”). He could wear pj’s. (Saks has a couture Derek Rose cotton flannel set, Arctic Striped, for $275.) He could move about in his birthday suit (but hope he doesn’t). And here’s another: The Donald J. Trump Collection could add a men’s lounge wear collection, including bathrobes, pj’s and slippers. Such  nighty-night attire would probably do well at, say, Mr. Trump’s MacLeod  House in Scotland. Even if your guy doesn’t hit the links there, he’ll need  something to ward off the, ahem, cold nights. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Super Bowl safety and security

Cathy Lanier won’t be calling the game plays at Super Bowl LI in Houston on Sunday. As the NFL’s senior VP of of security, her game book is pat, for the most part. Still, she certainly doesn’t want anyone saying, “Houston, we have a problem.” Security is tight: • The security perimeter alone stretches five city blocks; • Nearly 3,000 miles of concrete barriers are in place; • There are eyes and ears — thousands and thousands of eyes and ears — in private security; and • The skies are clear. Not from a weatherman or meteorological viewpoint, but from a safety and security perspective. NRG Stadium, home of the NFL’s Houston Texans, is a no-fly zone on game days. (Even Lady Gaga isn’t expected to swoop in like a caped vamp.) The remainder of Ms. Lanier’s to-do list includes: • working with 40 different federal agencies; • corralling a handful of local and state law enforcement agencies; • handling protesters wailing against immigration and refugee issues; • preparing for possibility of terrorists, who, as we saw just this week  at Paris’ Louvre Museum, like to showcase their violence in popular  public settings; • dealing with fans who could go over the edge before, during and after the game at NRG Stadium, which has a seating capacity of 71,795; and • controlling the stadium itself, which is on public, not private, property — unlike, say, the Patriots’ Gillette Stadium, which both are owned by the Kraft family. NRG is owned by Harris County. There will also be children, families and a broad array of celebrities and political folk on hand for the Super Bowl events, including former President George H.W. Bush, who is slated for the game’s coin toss. Texans l-o-v-e football, which could be construed as an understatement. This is Ms. Lanier’s first Super Bowl undertaking. Born and reared in the D.C. area, she spent her law enforcement career with the Metropolitan Police Department and was its chief for the past nine years. She grabbed the reins of NFL safety and security post last fall. As chief, she worked with multiple agencies on a daily basis, and twice clutched hands with the feds and regional law enforcers for the largest-ever Inaugural Day turnout in U.S. history — Barack Obama’s in 2009. Also, the nation’s capital could easily be dubbed “Protest Capital,” as some group is always rallying against something — even if that something entails breaking the law to hoist a banner that simply states “RESIST.” From Ms. Lanier’s perspective, though, the weeklong events for Super Bowl LI preparedness are no comparison. “This is a challenge much bigger than inauguration,” Ms. Lanier told D.C. area radio station WTOP. Next up: Super Bowl LII in Minnesota, home of the Vikings. Indeed, Ms. Lanier is scheduled to hit Minnesota soon after the Patriots-Falcons matchup. Good thing Texans do things big. Really big.

Pre-inaugural welcome includes Jon Voight, Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood
.B
Want to hear Tony and Grammy Award-winner Jennifer Holliday belt out a gospel song with the Lincoln Memorial as a backdrop? How about Lee Greenwood, whose “God Bless the USA” stirs the soul as a national anthem in and of itself? And what about Yonkers, New York-born “Midnight Cowboy” Jon Voight, who writes his own scripts on politics and, yes, Hollywood? Catch all three. Before the 58th presidential inauguration swearing-in ceremonies. On the National Mall. The best part? No tickets needed. The Presidential Inaugural Committee announced Friday that two special events are scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 19 — Voices of the People and Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration. “President-elect [Donald] Trump has made it clear that this inaugural is of, by, and for the American people. The 58th Inaugural will celebrate American history and heritage, while setting the course to a brighter and bolder future for all Americans,” said Chairman Tom Barrack. “Above all, it will serve as tribute to one of our greatest attributes, the peaceful transition of partisan power.” It’s fitting, too, that the free event is being held on the Mall, of course. But let’s get to the nonpartisan lineup, which includes the D.C. Fire Department Emerald Society Pipes and Drums, King’s Academy Honor Choir, the Republican Hindu Coalition, Montgomery Area High School Marching Band, Marlana Van Hoose, Maury NJROTC Color Guard, Pride of Madawaska, Webelos Troop 177, Northern Middle School Honors Choir, American Tap Company, South Park and District Pipe Band, Everett High School Viking Marching Band, TwirlTasTix Baton Twirling, and Celtic United Pipes and Drums. After those treats, come Messrs. Voight and Greenwood, as well as country songman Toby Keith and a tribute by military bands to our nation’s armed forces. There will be plenty of fireworks as a star-spangled punctuation mark. If you want free commemorative tickets, click here. If you can’t make it to the nation’s capital, no worries. The program, including remarks by President-elect Trump, is scheduled for network broadcasting. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Non-glitzy inauguration affairs - Chicago
.B
They all should be in Chicago. So very, very glad to know, though, that D.C. will be glammed up once Donald Trump occupies the White House. No offense. It’s just that the whole-food, vegan vibe isn’t organic to a little city like Washington, where nearly everything and everyone is from somewhere else. Consider the lineup of rallies and protestations surrounding Inaugural Week. New York native Al Sharpton wants to launch a resist-Trump movement on Jan. 14 in Washington. The rally is labeled We Shall Not Be Moved. Mr. Sharpton, the revered Rev. Shaprton, should be holding his rally in Chicago, pressuring politicians, bolstering peacemakers and reassuring children they shall not be moved until the bloodletting subsides. Another New Yorker, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who stands on the losing side of the Democratic presidential election, wants us to follow the Sharpton protestations in Any City, USA on Sunday, Jan. 15. In a “Dear Colleague” letter, Mr. Sanders joined Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in urging them to use the day before the official MLK holiday to rally around the country to vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos.” (Hmm. Are Christians not expected to attend on that Sunday?) Messrs. Sanders and Schumer, and Mrs. Pelosi undermine Chicagoans and black America every day they are silent about the record pace with which human beings are being cut down and maimed in the Windy City. On Monday the 16th, traditional supporters of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday usually perform community work. “A day on” not a day off, the slogan goes. (They’ll be too pooped if they follow Mr. Sharpton’s and Mr. Sanders’ lead.) Shame, shame, shame no peace rally is afoot. Then, there’s all the official inaugural hoopla, including the main attraction, the swearing in. Afterward, there’s the gowns and tuxedos, balls and parties, drinks and drunkards, how-dos and please don’ts. The frenzied “media,” and worn-out hospitality staffs and political party gurus yearning to be free. By the time Saturday rolls around? Well, take a gander: Gloria Steinem and the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar crowd wants us to hit the streets after the inauguration. All size bras are welcome, thank you very much. Besides, braless Harry Belafonte is co-chair of the Women’s March on Washington.Why the women libbers even thought it necessary to genderize their event is beyond post-gender comprehension.Anyway, one of the most appealing aspects of inauguration week is the money, honey.A crowd of 400,000 are expected to attend official inauguration events, with 500,000 to 1 million attendees expected at pre- and post-inaugural affairs.The ca-ching is the most appealing of all: The economic benefits to the D.C. area range between $1.04 billion and $1.34 billion. Not bad. Not bad at all.Of course, while D.C. is always a yuuuge magnet for government protests and rallies, there’s another city that deserves far more attention, and undivided at that. If you still are unsure what city that is and where, simply click here. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Carrie Fisher: Quotes from a funny lady
.B
Carrie Fisher, 60, died Tuesday, a few days after being hit with cardiac arrest on a flight from London to Los Angeles while on her book tour. Most writers immediately sprung into biographical mode upon learning of her death, which first was reported by TMZ. Born to singer-actress Debbie Reynolds and singer-actor Eddie Fisher, she was deemed royalty. We learned much later that this princess, Leia of “Star Wars” fame, was also a script doctor and a funny lady who fought not only The Empire, but also bipolar disease and substance abuse (alcohol and drugs). Let’s honor Fisher’s wit and wisdom through her own notable quotes.Two days before Election Day, a tweet “Trump speaking his mind isn’t refreshing, it’s appalling. Coca Cola is refreshing.”Her ‘Star Wars’ legacy “I am Princess Leia, no matter what. If I were trying to get a good table, I wouldn’t say I wrote ‘Postcards [From the Edge,’  her best-selling first novel]. Or, if I’m trying to get someone to take my check and I don’t have ID, I wouldn’t say: ‘Have you seen Harry Met Sally?’ Princess Leia will be on my tombstone.”Growing up in Hollywood“I was street smart, but unfortunately the street was Rodeo Drive.”“You can’t find any true closeness in Hollywood, because everybody does the fake closeness so well.”Resentment“Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.”Life and living“There is no point at which you can say, ‘Well, I’m successful now. I might as well take a nap.’ ”“I am a spy in the house of me. I report back from the front lines of the battle that is me. I am somewhat nonplused by the event that is my life.”“I don’t want my life to imitate art, I want my life to be art.”Thanks for sharing, Carrie Fisher. Rest in peace.

What Hillary didn’t tell you
.B
Hillary Rodham Clinton said a lot about a lot of things in her Thursday night acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, and throughout the week her supporters, including hubby Bill and daughter Chelsea, spent considerable time discussing her fight on behalf of women and children. With more than two months of Sundays left until voters hit the polls, there’s something else Mrs. Clinton needs to hand voters and that’s an explanation of her opposition to school vouchers. In a piece posted on the United Federation of Teachers website and titled “Public ed gets Hillary’s vote,” Mrs. Clinton readily explained herself at the July 18 convention of the another teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers.The post said: “Clinton advocated more community schools and the ‘right balance’ on testing. She vowed to continue to oppose ‘vouchers that drain resources from public schools and undermine their ability to provide the education our children deserve.’ “Donald Trump has said ‘America spends too much on education,’ Clinton said. ‘He wants to, and I quote, largely eliminate the Department of Education’ and its support programs. He would ‘leave our most vulnerable students to fend for themselves,’ she said.” For a history-maker who wants a pro-family, pro-children platform to resonate with a cross-section of voters, Mrs. Clinton’s opposition to public vouchers doesn’t square with her push for level playing fields for women and children. Indeed, it almost aligns her with the black-robed jurists and politicians who sustained school segregation. And, yes, there was many a Democrat among them.

Religion and the presidential race
.B
The Pew Research Center released a new report this week on religion and the 2016 presidential election. The Washington Times reported Thursday on the fact that the Pew study found evangelicals supporting Republican Donald Trump, and atheists and agnostics backing Democrat Hillary Clinton. There are, though, other tidbits from the study. * Nearly eight  in 10 white evangelical voters (77 percent) say that Mr. Trump would do a  better job of improving economic conditions, compared to 14 percent who  think Mrs. Clinton has the upper-hand in this area. * At  the same point during the 2012 presidential race, Republican Mitt Romney enjoyed a 15  percentage point advantage over Democrat Barack Obama among voters who attended church  at least weekly. That gap is considerably narrower. * There is decreasing concern over the importance of a president’s religious belief: 72 percent in 2008, 67 percent in 2012 and 62 percent in 2016. The Pew survey polled 2,245 U.S. adults, including 1,655  registered voters, from June 15-26. It has an overall  2.4 percent margin  of error. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

D.C. residents baffled by lack of attention over missing children
.B
The recent national outcry over missing children in Washington, D.C., has left residents east of the Anacostia River wondering why it took so long for people to recognize there was a problem. “This is a prime example of how a lot of young people in our city, especially east of the river, have been suffering in silence,” said Markus Batchelor, a lifelong resident of Congress Heights in Southeast Washington. Mr. Batchelor, who serves as the Ward 8 representative on the D.C. State Board of Education, said that since social media attention over missing children in the city has blown up, activists have been trying to mitigate a deluge of misinformation. Rumors about abductions, child slavery and a massive increase in missing children spread like wildfire across the country, with celebrities sharing tweets and Facebook posts claiming that 14 girls went missing from the city in a 24-hour period. Metropolitan Police quickly debunked that assertion and noted that some of the photos floating around weren’t even of D.C. residents. Missing persons cases have not increased in the District over the last five years, according to police statistics. In fact, they have fallen slightly this year. The Metropolitan Police Department has received an average of 200 missing person reports a month over the last five years. This year has averaged about 190 cases per month. And about 99 percent of cases over the last five years have been closed, police say. Still, talk about missing children only adds to the woes of residents in Ward 8, one of the city’s most impoverished jurisdictions. According to a recent D.C. Auditor’s report, about 50 percent of children age 5 and younger live in poverty in Ward 8. Comparatively, only 3 percent of children in Ward 3 live in poverty. “The real crisis in communities like ours isn’t abductions, it’s the breakdown of the family,” Mr. Batchelor said. He said many of the children whom police say are missing simply walked away from their homes because of an unstable or dangerous environment: “They don’t know that there are alternatives to just walking away and leaving it behind.” Olivia Henderson, a Southeast resident who lives near the Maryland border in Ward 8, said the problem of children leaving their homes has less to do with the kids and more to do with a lack of accountability by parents, the community and government officials. “Right now we’re not working together. A lot of people are saying ‘missing children,’ but this stuff starts with the household,” said Ms. Henderson, an advisory neighborhood commissioner. “If you just go out there and walk, you can see the neglect in sections of Ward 8. I’m out there walking, I’m talking to people. We are supposed to know our community.” Mr. Batchelor agreed, saying that the community and government officials need to arm children with information about where to go when they’re in distress. “People can walk away from home and walk into something much more dangerous,” he said. “As a community, we need to say, ‘We’re here if you need us, and here is information you can utilize if you need extra help.’” Beyond that, some Ward 8 residents feel they have been left behind by their city government. “You look for city services and you don’t get them,” said Ward 8 resident Anthony Muhammad. “If you tell a person they’re nothing, then that person starts living like they’re nothing.” Mr. Muhammad said even the little things affect the way residents see themselves in the community. Even lighting on the blocks near Metro stations can signal whether a city cares about its people. “It’s lit up on Barracks Row near the Metro like it’s daytime, but it’s pitch-black on Alabama Ave.,” he said, referring to the commercial area along 8th Street SE. The blow-up over missing children in the District started earlier this year when Mayor Muriel Bowser and Metropolitan Police decided to more widely promote missing persons cases in the city. Reporters and social media followers started seeing a deluge of press releases in early January about those who have gone missing, prompting some to wonder whether some new crisis was occurring. That wasn’t actually the case, according to Bowser spokesman Kevin Harris, who said there was no uptick in missing persons and that most cases were runaways and not abductions. By late March, as the social media attention on the District reached a fever pitch, Miss Bowser announced a task force and increased funding for missing children. The mayor said she would increase the number of police officers dedicated to finding missing children and allocate more money for nonprofits that work with children at risk of running away from home. “Regardless of where the numbers stand, we share the public’s sense of urgency for protecting our youth, which is why the policy changes we have instituted are so important,” Mr. Harris said. “By elevating the cases of all missing children in the District and connecting them with services, we are not only enhancing our efforts to protect our youth, but also elevating the District as a national model.” He said the District is like any other big city with its share of challenges, especially when it comes to supporting its most vulnerable residents. “But what sets us apart is the immediacy we place on spreading information about our missing young people and the priority we place on missing youth of color in particular,” Mr. Harris said.

White House: Md. school rape underscores Trump’s compassion for victims of illegal immigrant crimes
.B
The White House on Tuesday weighed in on the rape of a 14-year-old girl in a Montgomery County high school bathroom by two classmates, one of whom is an illegal immigrant, saying the case is “tragic” and the “human side” should not be overshadowed by politics. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the shocking crime, which occurred Thursday at Rockville High School, underscores why President Trump has made a priority of cracking down on crimes committed by illegal immigrants. “This is why he is passionate about this,” Mr. Spicer said when asked about the rape during the daily press briefing. SEE ALSO: School rape case raises important questions “Let’s remember the human side of this,” he said. “The idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific and whatever other words someone can think of.” Henry Sanchez, 18, and Jose Montano, 17, were arrested Thursday at Rockville High School and charged with three counts each in connection with the alleged rape of a female classmate. Both reportedly are recent arrivals to the U.S. A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that Mr. Sanchez had entered the country illegally last year, noting that a Border Patrol agent had encountered the youth in Texas in August. Mr. Sanchez had lived in Guatemala until he was 17 and is the subject of an “alien removal” case, The Washington Post reported. Mr. Montano was born in El Salvador, where he lived until he was 16, according to court records. Both are charged as adults with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offenses. “These are very serious allegations carrying a life sentence. The potential of life in prison would be available as we prosecute these individuals,” said Ramon Korionoff, a spokesman for the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office. Mr. Spicer said the case spurred many questions, but many of the issues had to be addressed by local government. “Immigration takes its toll on our people if it is not done legally,” he said. Mr. Sanchez had been ordered to appear before an immigration judge, but that appearance has been set for another time. A preliminary hearing for Mr. Montano is scheduled for March 31 and one for Mr. Sanchez on April 14. Judge Eugene Wolfe has ordered the two defendants to remain in custody without bond until their next hearings. According to police documents, the girl, identified by law enforcement as “Victim A,” told authorities that she was walking in a school hallway Thursday morning when she was approached by the two suspects. “Montano asked Victim A for sex, which she refused. Montano asked again, more persistently, and pushed Victim A into the boys’ bathroom,” police wrote in a probable cause statement after interviewing the girl. “Victim A was holding a sink to avoid going into the bathroom when Montano grabbed her hand and pulled her into the stall,” police wrote. Montano then began forcibly undressing the girl before Sanchez joined them inside the stall, according to police. Both suspects took turns raping the girl, according to police documents. She told administrators, who alerted police. Mr. Montano and Mr. Sanchez were arrested at school that same day. ⦁ Andrew Blake contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.

Rape at Maryland high school stirs up debate on sanctuary cities
.B
Henry Sanchez-Milian was nabbed sneaking across the U.S. border in August, just 13 days shy of his 18th birthday.Had he been 18, he might have been quickly deported back to Guatemala. But because he was a minor, he was given a court date, told to come back eventually, and released. He ended up in Montgomery County, Maryland, living with his father.He now stands charged, along with 17-year-old Jose O. Montano, of raping a 14-year-old classmate at Rockville High School, in a case that is roiling the immigration debate and forcing a search for blame.Some have pointed the finger at Montgomery County’s sanctuary policy, which generally protects illegal immigrants from being turned over to federal immigration authorities. Other analysts trace the situation back to President Obama’s lax enforcement policies, which allowed hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants to enter the U.S. and gain a foothold over the past four years.“That type of stuff is happening all over the country every day,” Chris Crane, head of the labor union that represents U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers, told Congress on Wednesday.The details of last week’s deeply disturbing crime are laid out in graphic court documents.The girl encountered Mr. Montano, whom she knew, in the school hallway the morning of March 16. As the two spoke, Mr. Montano made sexual advances, which the girl rebuffed. Mr. Montano then pushed her inside a boy’s restroom and into an empty stall where he began to remove her clothing. Mr. Montano and Mr. Sanchez-Milian then took turns raping and sodomizing her.Throughout the ordeal, the girl pleaded with her attackers to stop. The two men spoke to one another in Spanish, but continued.How the two young immigrants, who could face life in prison if convicted of rape, arrived in Montgomery County isn’t entirely clear. Both enrolled in the school system this fall, and due to their limited English proficiency and schooling were placed in special courses.Before arriving in the Washington, D.C. region, immigration officials say Mr. Sanchez-Milian was apprehended on Aug. 12 by a Border Patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas — ground zero for the surge of the tens of thousands of “unaccompanied alien children,” or UACs in government speak, who have made their way from Central America to the U.S. since 2013.Mr. Sanchez-Milian, from Guatemala, was issued a court date and released. Though he was younger than 18, it’s unclear whether he was treated like other UACs. Under federal law and Obama administration policy, UACs are supposed to be processed quickly and released to parents, relatives or other sponsors.A local ABC station reported that Mr. Sanchez-Milian was living with his father here, while Mr. Montano, whom court records indicate was born in El Salvador, was living with an uncle. Immigration officials have declined to say anything about Mr. Montano’s immigration status or background, citing his age.In addition to lengthy prison sentences, the two now also face deportation, once the Montgomery County case concludes, suggesting Jose is also an illegal immigrant. During their brief time in the D.C. region, Montgomery County police officials said neither had any run-ins with local law enforcement. Brad Botwin, director of Help Save Maryland, a group that opposes illegal immigration, said he was saddened by news of the attack and disappointed by officials’ response. He said local officials shirked their responsibility and that their policies helped set the scene for the brutal attack.“The system failed this girl, and the electorate failed this young lady,” he said.The Obama administration’s polices on immigration opened the door for illegal immigrants to enter the country but Montgomery County officials have essentially rolled out the welcome mat for illegal border-crossers by adopting sanctuary policies that make the county a safe haven, Mr. Botwin said.“If my kid didn’t have a polio shot they wouldn’t allow my son or daughter to enter the school but they’re telling me they aren’t screening them?” he said, adding that schools should at least have an obligation to determine whether immigrant students are really the age they purport to be.Montgomery County Public Schools Superintendent Jack Smith said it is the school’s responsibility to provide an education for all young people in the county, and that it couldn’t conduct immigration status requests or background checks to vet prospective students. “We serve every student who walks through our door. We are a public school system and we serve all of our students when they come to us,” Mr. Smith said during a news conference this week. “It’s not only the right thing to do… It’s also the law of the land.” The two rape suspects, who both began classes in the county school system in the fall, were enrolled in the Multidisciplinary Educational Training and Support (METS) program for English language learners with limited or no previous schooling. Schools can’t turn away students due to immigration status, so they’ve come under increasing pressure in recent years due to the surge of illegal immigrants coming from Central America, said Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies. She said the Obama administration could have done more to combat the increase, but instead created policies that its own agents said invited more people to attempt the journey, hoping to tack advantage of lax enforcement. Once the children were in the U.S., the Obama administration put serious pressure on localities to make sure they ended up in schools. “I think this is a problem that was dumped on Montgomery County and lots of other school systems,” Ms. Vaughan said. “Even the decision to place them in the high schools — even that, it sounds crazy, but at least one other school system got in trouble for not mainstreaming them, faced legal action. So their hands are tied on these kids.” Though it’s unclear whether the two students were officially part of the UAC program, illegal immigrant children from Central America have put increasing stress on public schools across the country — and in the metropolitan Washington area in particular. The children are usually delivered to relatives, and the District of Columbia’s surrounding counties have a high population of immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, which are the main countries that make up the surge. Since the beginning of 2014, Montgomery County has been the destination for 3,286 UACs. Prince George’s County has received 4,144, and Fairfax County in Virginia has taken in 3,925. But groups that work with local immigrant communities said children who come here as immigrants, illegally or legally, deserve access to an education. “It is good not only for the individuals, but for the society,” Fernanda Durand, a spokeswoman for Casa, a Maryland-based organization that helps provide resources for low-income Latino and immigrant communities. “We would not want a situation where a whole class of people was uneducated.” The attack has prompted questions about whether it was 18-year-old Mr. Sanchez-Milian in the same grade as younger students. While Mr. Smith said the student “was enrolled in the appropriate program to give him the services he needed” and that there are plenty of 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds in the school district’s high schools, the county is reconsidering how it assesses placement of students in its various programs. “Certainly we will take a good hard look at how we place students,” Mr. Smith said. Immigrant rights advocates said the crime was a tragedy but warned against tarring all immigrants, or even all illegal immigrants, with blame. “This is about rape, and the case lies with prosecutors. Those who would turn it into an immigration debate are pursuing their own agenda,” said Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. He said studies show immigrants — including those in the country illegally — have lower rates of criminality than native-born Americans. A study released last week by the Cato Institute said illegal immigrants account for about 9 percent of the total U.S. population ages 18 to 54 but just 5.6 percent of the incarcerated population. By contrast, the native-born make up 82.4 percent of the U.S. population and 91.5 percent of the population in prisons and jails. Legal immigrants have the lowest rate of all, making up 8.5 percent of the U.S. population ages 18-54 but less than 3 percent of the incarcerated population, Cato said. Immigrant rights activists also said the rape case should not sour Maryland jurisdictions on becoming sanctuaries that refuse cooperation with federal immigration agents. The House of Delegates this week approved a bill to prevent prisons and jails from honoring detainer requests from ICE, which often asked for illegal immigrants to be held for pickup. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has threatened a veto. Ms. Durand said it was unfair that anyone would exploit the attack to score political points. “We think the pain of this women should not be used by anyone to further their political views and to attack immigrants and to try to get immigrants out of this country,” Ms. Durand said.

Jurors ask judge about gun evidence in gang conspiracy trial
.B
CHICAGO (AP) - Jurors deliberating at the racketeering conspiracy trial of six alleged leaders of Chicago’s Hobos street gang have sent a note to a federal judge asking about gun evidence. They sent the note late Wednesday just before ending their third full day of deliberations. Deliberations resume Thursday. Jurors said they wanted better pictures of guns Hobos allegedly wielded in a clothing-store robbery. They didn’t say why. The judge sent a note back saying high-definition photographs of the guns were on a flash drive in the jury room. Prosecutors say the conspiracy included robberies and nine killings. Police say gang activity is to blame for many of over 750 homicides in Chicago this year. They also cited gangs in reporting more than 50 shootings and 11 deaths during the Christmas holiday weekend.

Evangelicals back Trump; atheists support Hillary, Pew survey finds
.B
A new survey shows evangelicals and atheists are sharply divided over which presidential candidate to support in 2016. The Pew Research Center study released Wednesday finds nearly four out of five white evangelicals back Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, while two-thirds of atheists or agnostics plan to support Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. Each constituency makes up about one-fifth of registered voters. Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, said the data suggest the political parties are becoming increasingly polarized on religious grounds. He attributed the phenomenon to the Obama administration’s effort to drive faith from the public square, drawing a backlash from evangelicals with a broader view of what religious liberty entails. SEE ALSO: Clinton courts Hispanics by slamming ‘divisive’ Trump, meets with Senate Democrats “I think without question the Obama administration has been very aggressive in trying to relegate the practice of religion to the four corners of houses of worship,” Mr. Blackwell said. “Therefore, the resistance to that sort of narrowing of the concept of religious freedom has grown more intense on the other side.” Nearly half of white evangelicals report that it has become more difficult to live their faith in the last several years. And 82 percent of white evangelicals who say it’s harder to be an evangelical today support Mr. Trump, while 72 percent of those who say it isn’t more difficult to be an evangelical support the GOP candidate. Meanwhile, 66 percent of atheists and agnostics said they’re backing Mrs. Clinton, which is consistent with the number of secular voters who supported President Obama in 2012. SEE ALSO: White House says more Black Lives Matter protests ‘a good thing’ But the religiously unaffiliated strongly supported Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic primary rival, Sen. Bernard Sanders, and don’t appear overly enthusiastic about the former secretary of state. Just 26 percent said they “strongly support” Mrs. Clinton, while 40 percent are tacitly backing her. That number is down from 2012, when 37 percent of religiously unaffiliated voters said they strongly supported Mr. Obama in his re-election bid. Despite questions about the billionaire businessman’s biblical acumen and concerns over his multiple divorces, evangelicals appear to be backing Mr. Trump in greater numbers than they did Mitt Romney, a devout Mormon, in 2012. The poll found 36 percent of evangelicals “strongly support” Mr. Trump in the presidential race, up from just 26 percent who said the same of Mr. Romney four years prior. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said it’s difficult for evangelicals to rationalize supporting Mr. Trump on scriptural grounds. “To me, it confirms something I’ve said and believed for decades, and that is that the religious right comes to its ideological positions and then kind of encrusts some religious verbiage on top of it,” Mr. Lynn said. “So they decide guns are good or gays are bad and then they decide to find some alleged connection to Scripture to bolster that argument.” But Mr. Blackwell, who was among a group of evangelicals to meet with Mr. Trump in New York last month, said one does not have to agree with Mr. Trump theologically in order to support his political prescriptions. “When I was part of the group that met with him in New York, I wasn’t necessarily looking for him to agree with me 100 percent theologically,” he said. “I was looking to see if I could glean from what he said that he was truly committed to the classical notion of religious liberty, and I came away from it that he was.” Although Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have said their favorite book is the Bible, the need for religious pandering from the chief executive may be drawing to an end. Just 62 percent of Americans said having a president with strong religious beliefs is important to them, the survey found, down from 67 percent in 2012 and 72 percent in 2008. That trend comes as Americans are increasingly suspicious of whether churches and other houses of worship should become involved in politics. A plurality, 49 percent, said the church should not delve into political matters, compared to 47 percent who said it should. And just 29 percent said churches should take the additional step of endorsing political candidates for office. Despite the significance the survey attributes to religion, data suggest that race still plays a more important factor in determining one’s political preference. While white Protestants overwhelmingly support Mr. Trump, 89 percent of black Protestants and 77 percent of Hispanic Catholics said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton if the election were held today — numbers consistent with racial voting patterns regardless of faith.

Clinton courts Hispanics by slamming ‘divisive’ Trump, meets with Senate Democrats
.B
Hillary Clinton wooed Hispanic leaders, powwowed with Senate Democrats and campaigned in Virginia with one of her potential vice presidential picks Thursday, making the rounds in and around the Beltway as she tries to put distance between herself and likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mrs. Clinton, speaking at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Washington, said she regrets the kind of campaign Mr. Trump is running. “Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetime,” she said. “His message is that you should be afraid — afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, whose religious faith is different or who were born in a different country.” “That’s, my friends, no innuendo or dog whistle anymore. It’s all out in the open now,” she said. “So we’ve got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.” Mrs. Clinton is looking to shore up key Democratic constituencies such as Hispanic voters after winning the endorsement this week of Sen. Bernard Sanders, her chief rival in the primary contests, in what was seen as something of a seal of approval for liberals from the far-left Mr. Sanders. Her campaign also announced Thursday that she would speak by video to liberal activists at the Netroots Nation conference this weekend in Missouri. She told the United Latin American Citizens that simply winning the presidential election isn’t enough. “Together, we must send a resounding message to Donald Trump in November and earn a decisive mandate against demagoguery and fear,” she said. “We need to inspire a level of voter turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket, that will lead to more support of leaders at all levels of government who can put a stop to aggressive, anti-immigration measures.” She argued that President Obama acted within his authority when he moved to grant work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants in the country, even though a deadlocked Supreme Court last month left in place a lower court’s ruling against the president’s deportation amnesty program. A poll from Univision News released this week showed Mrs. Clinton with a 48-point lead, 67 percent to 19 percent, over Mr. Trump among Hispanic voters — even bigger than Mr. Obama’s 2012 margin, when he won the Hispanic vote by about a 71 percent to 27 percent margin over Republican nominee Mitt Romney. But the survey said a narrow plurality of Hispanic voters believe Mrs. Clinton is a liar. Other polling shows that solid majorities of voters overall do not think she is honest and trustworthy. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, a possible vice presidential pick for Mrs. Clinton, vouched for the candidate’s character in part by showing his Spanish-speaking skills while campaigning with her before a community college crowd in Northern Virginia. “Estamos listos para Hillary,” he said, which translates to “We’re ready for Hillary.” Mr. Kaine said he learned as a missionary in Honduras that the best compliment to someone was to say they were “listo,” “to say that they were ready.” “In Spanish, in Honduras, what ‘ready’ means is more than just on time — it means well-prepared,” he said. “It means you’re ready to get on the battlefield. You’re ready to fight. You’re somebody that can be counted on.” Mrs. Clinton, elected twice as a U.S. senator from New York, also met privately with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill. She said the conversation “really focused on the very positive difference that Democrats want to make in the lives of Americans — particularly when it comes to economic opportunity, to tackle the problems that, unfortunately, have been ignored by the Republican majority.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

White House says more Black Lives Matter protests ‘a good thing’
.B
As police departments across the country geared up for more Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the White House on Thursday called the street protests “a good thing.” Military bases posted warnings to personnel to stay away from public gathering spots Friday evening in 37 cities such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis “due to potential protests and criminal activity.” Others said the online call for a “Day of Rage” across the U.S. is likely a hoax. Law enforcement officials acknowledge they are on edge after the assassinations of five police officers in Dallas last week at a Black Lives Matter demonstration and the arrests in the past week of hundreds of people in major cities protesting the shooting deaths of two black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the Black Lives Matter protests — as long as they are peaceful — could help bring reforms in police departments. “I would not describe the White House as concerned about these protests,” Mr. Earnest said. “They’re exercising their freedom of speech, they’re exercising their freedom of assembly. That’s a good thing. That’s a good start.” President Obama took part in a televised town hall meeting in Washington with minority youths, parents, police and others to discuss problems with policing, including bias. The program was scheduled to air Thursday night. After another meeting with police and civil rights leaders this week, Mr. Obama said the U.S. is “not even close” to resolving tensions between minority communities and police departments. “We will see more tension,” he said. Some black leaders say they plan to devote more attention to the crisis than to the presidential election, which could pose a complication for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It’s unclear how the racial tensions might play out in the campaign, but presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump this week began referring to himself as the “law-and-order” candidate. A coalition of law enforcement officials told Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in a letter this week that reducing arrests and imprisoning fewer Americans are key to promoting law and order. The letter from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the National District Attorneys Association and other groups said rehabilitation and shorter prison sentences are paths to reducing crime. “Though this may seem counterintuitive, we know from our experience as law enforcement officials that over-relying on incarceration does not deter crime,” they wrote. “With finite prison space, we believe prison should be used for the most dangerous offenders.” With six months left in Mr. Obama’s presidency, his spokesman said there is only so much the president can do to resolve the long-simmering problems between police and minorities in many communities. “The president will do his part,” Mr. Earnest said, “but he’s not at all going to be able to do this alone. It’s not something that the president of the United States is going to be able to do just by delivering a thoughtful, eloquent, powerful speech. This is mostly going to fall on the shoulders of men and women of good will in law enforcement, in elected office, in faith communities, churches, and mosques, and synagogues, at universities, high schools, and homes.” The National League of Cities and U.S. Conference of Mayors called for local officials to hold “100 community conversations on race relations, justice, policing and equality,” The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill announced the formation of a task force to examine police accountability and aggression toward law enforcement. “I think we need to listen and learn, instead of just starting to throw bombs at each other,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Trump’s first 100 days have been devastating to environment, say green activists 
.B
Out of all the groups in the liberal coalition, environmentalists may have had the worst of it during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Leading green activists say President Trump has already done a full term’s worth of damage, rolling back Obama-era regulations and installing one of their chief critics as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The president’s pick to lead the EPA, Scott Pruitt, built his political career by challenging environmental and climate-change regulations while Oklahoma attorney general. Since his confirmation in February, the EPA has already started to dismantle the Clean Power Plan — federal rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants — and a host of other regulations. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt are intent on reversing eight years of EPA policy under the previous administration, transitioning the agency away from its Obama-era focus on climate change and expanding its regulatory reach, toward enforcing existing protections against air and water pollution. Working with Congress, Mr. Trump also has rolled back new authority given to the EPA to regulate small bodies of water across the country. The agency also shelved plans that would’ve required oil-and-gas companies to record and provide to the federal government vast amounts of information about emissions from their drilling sites. In addition, Mr. Trump lifted costly restrictions on coal-mining operations across the country. Mr. Trump also handed environmentalists a stinging defeat by approving the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and by proposing massive budget cuts to the EPA and climate-change programs in other corners of the federal government. Internationally, the administration is weighing whether to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate-change treaty. Just this week, Mr. Trump ordered a review of national monument designations, potentially opening up new federal lands to energy development. All told, environmentalists say the president’s first 100 days have been devastating. They argue that Mr. Trump didn’t tell voters the truth about his intentions. “I would call this an extreme agenda that for someone who didn’t even win a majority of the vote is out of line with the values of the American people,” said Erich Pica, president of the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “He didn’t run on getting rid of the Clean Water Act and making water dirtier.  He didn’t run on any of that, yet that’s what his extreme agenda is doing right now.” Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said this week that “the hallmark of the president’s first 100 days” has been a relentless “assault on our climate, environment and national heritage.” On the heels of the executive order reviewing national monuments, other environmental activists accused the president of using his first months in office to sell out the country to the fossil fuel industry. “Leave it to Trump to take aim at an American tradition and principle that is beloved across political affiliations — our public lands, waters, and monuments. Trump wants to carve up this country into as many giveaways to the oil and gas industry as possible,” said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace. “But people who cannot afford the membership fee at Mar-a-Lago still want water they can drink, air they can breathe and beautiful places to go for refuge.” Moving forward, activists say that many of the administration’s moves may not necessarily be long-lasting and, to at least some degree, could be changed by a future Democratic administration. Environmental groups also are suing the administration over virtually every move it makes on the energy and climate front, meaning many policies, ultimately, will be set by federal courts. But what activists fear most are fundamental changes inside the EPA, Energy Department, and Interior Department that cannot be undone. For example, Mr. Pica said the president’s desired 30 percent budget cut at the EPA is the type of massive transformation that would be difficult to reverse. “The rules and the regulations will be litigated over the course of time, but it’s the budget stuff that could have the long-lasting impact on how these agencies operate,” Mr. Pica said.

The first legal wolf hunt in the state in more than two years began on Tuesday. Successful wolf hunters have 10 days to report their kills. Sporting goods store owner and hunting guide Robb Wiley says bad weather may be a factor for the slow start. When wolves were taken off the endangered species list five years ago, only 23 of the 2,153 hunters that purchased the license killed a wolf. ___ Information from: Jackson Hole (Wyo.)

Among them were John and Rosemary Howlett. The Maplewood residents said they are “terrified” about what state the environment will be in for their grandchildren’s grandchildren if action is not taken now to reverse climate change.

Utah water-use data released after public records requests
.B
OGDEN, Utah (AP) - Utah officials have released data on water use after a lengthy public records battle with a grassroots conservation organization. The Utah Division of Water Resources published the 2015 data it collected on hundreds of water providers with Utah Division of Water on its website Tuesday, the Standard-Examiner reported (http://bit.ly/2psrL6P). The Utah Rivers Council began requesting the release of the data in 2016. The request came after a 2015 state audit determined that division officials did not have an accurate sense of how much water Utah residents were using. The audit also cited significant inaccuracies in the data. The division normally releases the data it collects every five years. “We’re psyched they built a website for it. We want everyone to see it. Transparency is in everybody’s interest,” said Zack Frankel with the Utah Rivers Council. “There’s so much data in there, it’s going to take us a while to review it.” The council says the agency might have specifically highlighted data that supported the Bear River Project and the Lake Powell Pipeline. The projected price of the proposals is around $2.5 billion. Division Director Eric Millis said the agency would only make changes to data when it sees obvious problems. Along with the data, the Utah Division of Water Rights posted a summary that commented on the difficulties in collecting the data. Some water providers used the wrong units when they reported the gallons used or incorrectly categorized water use, according to the summary. The division worked with 269 of the water providers to address the inaccuracies, Millis said. “They’re very important numbers. We’re anxious and interested in making sure they’re as correct as they can be,” he said. “We understand the data-gathering process isn’t perfect. We’re working with water suppliers, and I think the suppliers are responding.” ___ Information from: Standard-Examiner, http://www.standard.net Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

It marks the first births of the critically endangered animal at the museum since 2002. A critically endangered species is at very high risk of extinction. Red wolves were once a top predator throughout the southeastern United States. Their numbers now total less than 300. The museum’s red wolves are part of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s red wolf recovery program. The mother was born at a nature center in Tennessee and transferred to Durham last November.

LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - The state of Nebraska has made a goal to keep monarch butterflies and other pollinators off the federal endangered species list by planting 125 million milkweed plants by 2020 and providing incentives for farmers to incorporate pollinator habitat into their land. The plan was created by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, with input from dozens of organizations and business, some which attended a summit on monarch butterflies in Lincoln last year. “Participation by many groups may be the only way to conserve migration and breeding habitat for monarchs, avert a threatened or endangered listing of the species, and prevent decline of other pollinators,” a recently released draft of the plan said. World Wildlife Fund data says that the eastern monarch population has dropped an estimated 90 percent in the past 20 years, mostly because of habitat loss. This includes the conversion of 53 million acres of grassland to cropland in the Great Plains since 2009, the Lincoln Journal Star (http://bit.ly/2qbhqfv ) reported. Efforts to help monarchs, such as planting milkweed and careful application of pesticides, can also benefit other pollinators at risk of being listed as endangered. Some of these pollinators include bumblebees, married underwing and Whitney underwing moths. “Nebraska decided to be proactive,” commission biologist Melissa Panella said. Panella said the federal government will wait until at least 2019 to decide whether to list monarchs as threatened or endangered. ___ Information from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Rare Central newt found in eastern Iowa during field trip

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Some Iowa City Community School District students snagged an interesting find on a recent nature field trip: a rare Central newt. Kids normally net an assortment of turtles, frogs and snails during the annual School of the Wild field trips in eastern Iowa. Fifth-grader Brody Hiscock thought he’d scooped a leech into his net, until he noticed it had legs. “It was slimy. Kind of wet,” Hiscock told the Press-Citizen (http://icp-c.com/2qf0xU3 ). Chad Swope, who leads the field trips, said herpetologists confirmed the small salamander as a Central newt - a  threatened species not native to Johnson County. Paul Frese, a research technician for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ wildlife diversity program, said last week’s is the only Central newt finding he knows of in Johnson County. Sometimes thought of as a subspecies of the Eastern newt, the salamander typically dwells in areas near the Cedar and Wapsipinicon rivers, Frese said. He said the organization HerpMapper contacted him about the finding. “That’s pretty cool in itself,” he said. Frese said the department likes to hear from community members who uncover unique finds, noting he would be interested to learn of any other Central newt sightings. The School of the Wild program seeks to raise awareness about natural areas, increase students’ appreciation of the wilderness and encourage protection of such areas, Swope said. The weeklong field trip annually exposes roughly 1,000 fifth- and sixth-graders from Iowa City area elementary schools to natural history, outdoor recreation and wilderness survival. ___ Information from: Iowa City Press-Citizen, http://www.press-citizen.com/ Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

The Meriden Record-Journal reports (http://bit.ly/2oQvppa ) the catch-and-release fishing event will be held on May 7. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said the 2015 fish kill was caused by low oxygen levels in the pond, which were triggered by a lack of rain and very warm temperatures. Town officials have been looking at ways to prevent such incidents in the future. A recent study revealed the pond is very shallow, with extensive plant growth. The pond has been deemed safe for this year’s fishing derby. ___ Information from: Record-Journal, http://www.record-journal.com Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A Minnesota city has turned to a goat rental company to help get rid of invasive plants along the Mississippi River. Minnesota Public Radio News (http://bit.ly/2qePtGh ) reported that St. Paul will deploy 30 goats from Goat Dispatch to clean up fenced areas of parkland. They are scheduled to make their debut Monday at Indian Mounds Regional park and are expected to spend several months grazing on invasive plants in the area. The company said goats are particularly suited to improving parkland because they prefer broadleaf plants and leave grass alone. They also eat the seedling stems of plants, so the seeds of invasive plants will be digested instead of sprouting. The city said they believe the goats are well-suited for the hilly terrain above the river downstream from downtown. “Using goats to clear land and woody areas is much more cost effective than many traditional methods. The costs of clearing land by hand, equipment rental, labor, permits, and debris disposal can add up very quickly,” the company said on its website. The city’s initial announcement didn’t address costs. Other parks in nearby cities have used sheep and goats before to deal with unwanted plants. Land improvement is part of the city’s 2013 Great River Passage plan, which aims to better connect the city with the waterway. ___ Information from: KNOW-FM, http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/stations/knowksjn/ Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Thousands of people have gathered in sweltering heat in the nation’s capital to demand more action to fight climate change and protect the environment. Saturday’s demonstration in Washington coincided with similar protests around the country in what is being called the People’s Climate March. Demonstrators in Washington started their march near the Capitol and slowly made their way to the White House. The protests coincide with President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office and take aim at his environmental policies. On Friday, a federal appeals court postponed a ruling on lawsuits challenging provisions of former President Barack Obama’s plan to reduce emissions from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency sought to put the legal fight on hold after Trump signed an executive order to roll back the plan. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

A small liberal arts school in Colorado has kicked out two of its students for anonymously penning offensive social media posts and sharing a screenshot from an episode of South Park. Thaddeus Pryor, a junior at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, learned on November 20 that he had received a 21-month suspension for something he posted two weeks earlier on Yik Yak, a social media application which allows users to broadcast a message to others located within a given range. Responding to someone in the area who posted “#blackwomenmatter,” Mr. Pryor said: “They matter, they’re just not hot.” The message was penned anonymously, but the student admitted his role when approached by campus officials who had been tipped-off. SEE ALSO: JebBush.com redirects to Donald Trump’s campaign website “It could be considered as mean,” the student told The Colorado Springs Gazette last week. “But I did not mean it as hateful or violent or anything of that sort.” Mr. Pryor can stay enrolled with roughly 2,000 other students at Colorado College, but can’t set foot on campus or earn credit elsewhere until 2017; the same can’t be said for his housemate, Lou Henriques, however, who was informed by the school on Nov. 20 that he was being expelled permanently for his Yik Yak posts, including one in which he shared a screenshot from an 8-year-old episode of South Park in which a character incorrectly answers a “People Who Annoy You” puzzle on Wheel of Fortune with the N-word rather than “NAGGERS.” Henriques had also posted the words “RACE WAR” on Yik Yak, the private school’s Catalyst newspaper reported, which he said were in reference to another episode of the animated series. SEE ALSO: San Bernardino shooters had target practice before massacre: FBI “I’m sorry that people were offended by them,” he told the Catalyst. “I said them merely as jokes. I understand that they were offensive.” Indeed, the college largely failed to see the humor and, in addition to taking action against the students, also hosted a school-wide forum on racism directly as a result of the Yik Yak scandal. Both students were quick to appeal the disciplinary actions, and while Mr. Pryor is still awaiting a decision, Mr. Henriques has agreed to withdraw from the college rather than be formally expelled, the Catalyst reported. “I don’t think the student body condones or should condone what I said, and I don’t expect them to,” Mr. Henriques told the paper. “I also don’t think many students condone the expulsion. The school took a very hard line and was probably reacting to the racism going on at colleges throughout the country.” Mr. Pryor, meanwhile, has since garnered the support of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE — a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that fights for freedom of speech — as he attempts to be readmitted on campus. “Colorado College’s disciplinary action toward Pryor — a 21 month suspension — for posting what was intended to be a joke on social media completely contradicts the school’s promises of freedom of speech,” FIRE Senior Program Officer Ari Cohn said in a statement. “The college’s punitive and heavy-handed overreaction to Pryor’s social media post will have a chilling effect on campus discourse.” College officials cannot legally discuss the issue due to privacy laws, the Catalyst reported, and Mr. Pryor told the Gazette that a ruling on his appeal is expected later this year.

Pope Francis in Egypt, seeks Christian-Muslim rejection of violence
.B
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis is brushing off security concerns to forge ahead on Friday with a two-day trip to Egypt aimed at presenting a united Christian-Muslim front that repudiates violence committed in God’s name. Three weeks after Islamic militants staged twin Palm Sunday church attacks, Francis is to lands in Cairo in the early afternoon for a series of deeply symbolic encounters with Egypt’s religious and political leadership. He will meet with Egypt’s president, patriarch and the “other” pope, Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and pray for victims of the attacks. Most importantly, he will also visit Al-Azhar, the revered 1,000-year-old seat of learning in Sunni Islam. There, he will meet privately with grand imam Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, and participate in an international peace conference Friday afternoon. Looking relaxed and cheerful and carrying his own travel satchel as usual, the pope climbed the steps of the Alitalia jet in late morning and chatted with the flight crew. The plane took off from Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci airport about 11 a.m. (0900 GMT). The goal of the trip is to bring a message of peace to a country that has been ravaged by Islamic extremist attacks, and encourage a culture of respect and tolerance for religious minorities, said Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state. “The fundamental issue is education, and educating those of different religious beliefs and especially the young, to have great respect for those of other faiths,” Parolin told the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano. “The question of language is fundamental: when you use a violent language, there is the danger that it can result in violent acts.” After visiting Al-Azhar, Francis meets with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, and then heads to the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church, which accounts for about 10 percent of Egypt’s 92 million people. Francis and Tawadros will preside over an ecumenical prayer service in St. Peter’s church, the Coptic cathedral that was the site of a December suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State militants that killed 30 people. Francis has frequently spoken out about today’s Christian martyrs and the “ecumenism of blood” that has united Catholic, Orthodox and other Christians targeted for their faith by Islamic militants. Parolin, the Vatican No. 2, said he hoped Francis’ visit might help convince them to “stay in their countries despite the difficulties and continue to give their Christian testimony in a majority Muslim society.” While Francis eschewed the armored popemobile his predecessors used on foreign trips, security was visibly tightened for the 27 hours he will be on the ground in Cairo. Streets that will be used by the pontiff’s motorcade around the Coptic Orthodox cathedral and the Vatican Embassy were cleared of cars, and police swarmed the upscale Cairo neighborhood of Zamalek on a Nile River island where Francis will sleep on Friday. Policemen in riverboats patrolled the Nile in front of the embassy. Security men were posted every hundred meters (yards) or so along the 20-kilometer (12-mile) stretch between the airport and central Cairo in anticipation of Francis’ arrival. Armored cars were stationed in front of the presidential palace, where Francis makes his first stop. The pope’s visit, however, is unlikely to cause much disruption to the city of some 18 million people as it falls on the Muslim Friday-Saturday weekend, when the usually congested traffic is significantly lighter. Banners in the Zamalek neighborhood welcomed Francis, with one from a private company saying “1,000,000 workers of Sharm el-Sheikh welcome the pontiff.” ___ Associated Press Writers Menna Zaki, Brian Rohan, Lamia Radi and Hamza Hendawi in Cairo contributed to this report.

‘13 Reasons Why,’ controversial drama about teen suicide, gets strict new rating in New Zealand
.B
Netflix’s popular “13 Reasons Why” may well get renewed for a second season, but the controversial drama about a teenage bullying victim who commits suicide has garnered a stricter rating by authorities in New Zealand over concerns that the subject matter is inappropriate for teenagers. “The country’s Office of Film & Literature Classification has created a new category for the show, which will now be known as RP18,” explained the BBC Thursday, noting that Pacific island nation has the “highest rate of teen suicide in the world.” The new classification means that it is illegal to show the content to a viewer under the age of 18 unless he or she is watching it with a parent or guardian. Previously there were only two such classifications in this category, RP13 and RP16, which set age restrictions at 13 and 16 respectively. While the drama has “significant merit” for “address[ing] issues that are highly relevant to young people, including suicide, sexual violence, bullying, and slut-shaming,” the Film & Literature Classification office said on its website, the portrayal of the main character’s suicide was the impetus for its decision, they explained. “Hannah’s suicide is presented fatalistically. Her death is represented at times as not only a logical, but an unavoidable outcome of the events that follow,” said the film board’s official blog. “Suicide should not be presented to anyone as being the result of clear headed thinking. Suicide is preventable, and most people who experience suicidal thoughts are not thinking rationally and therefore cannot make logical decisions.” The blog post concluded with a note that classification office hopes the rating serves to balance out the importance of raising awareness of teen suicide with the right of parents to safeguard their teenagers’ emotional welfare. “This classification allows the intended audience of young people to continue to access the series, while providing the necessary intervention of adult supervision in order to keep them safe and sufficiently navigate the relevant but troubling issues that we acknowledge as a part of their lived reality.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

China bans Muslim names like ‘jihad’ to ‘curb religious fervor’
.B
The Chinese government has banned more than two dozen Islamic names in an attempt to “curb religious fervor” among its Muslim minority population. “Jihad,” “Muhammad,” and “Arafat” are a small sampling of names that are prohibited for over 10 million Uighurs in China’s western region of Xinjiang, The New York Times reported. A “List of Banned Ethnic Minority Names” was provided to The Times and confirmed by security officials in Urumqi and other cities. SEE ALSO: ‘Allah’ surname fight for couple’s daughter sparks Georgia lawsuit Dilxat Raxit, a  spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, lamented the “increasingly hostile” rules for China’s Muslim population. “Uighur people have to be  cautious if they want to give their children names they are happy with,  and at the same time avoid punishment from the government,” the activist said. Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, called it “the latest absurd restriction that the Chinese government has imposed on people in Xinjiang.” Cultural battles over Islamic names is not endemic to China. A case in the U.S. involving a Georgia couple was recently resolved when the state reversed course and issued a birth certificate with the surname “Allah” for their daughter. Elizabeth Handy and Bilal Walk turned to the ACLU of Georgia in March over a protracted legal battle with the Peach State. Their 3-year-old daughter was denied the name Zalykha Graceful Lorraina Allah until Friday. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission.

Pope Francis gives TED talk: ‘Power is like drinking gin on an empty stomach’
.B
The TED2017 conference managed to secure a well-known speaker with a regular audience of 1.2 billion Catholics — Pope Francis. Attendees at TED’s “The Future You” conference in Vancouver on Tuesday night watched as the pope addressed three key topics from the Vatican. The head of the Catholic Church urged people to see how interconnected they are to one another, recognize the promises and pitfalls of technological progress, and to participate in “the revolution of tenderness.” “The more powerful you are, the more your actions will have an  impact on people, the more responsible you are to act humbly,” the pope said. “If you  don’t, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin the other. There is a  saying in Argentina: ‘Power is like drinking gin on an empty stomach.’ You feel dizzy, you get drunk, you lose your balance, and you will end  up hurting yourself and those around you, if you don’t connect your  power with humility and tenderness. Through humility and concrete love, on the other hand, power — the highest, the strongest one — becomes a  service, a force for good. The 80-year-old also warned individuals not to consider themselves a island, an idea explored in Trappist monk Thomas Merton’s 1955 book “No Man is an Island.” “I would love it if this meeting could help to remind us that we all need each other, none of us is an island, an autonomous and independent ‘I,’ separated from the other, and we can only build the future by standing together, including everyone,” the pope said. “We don’t think about it often, but everything is connected, and we need to  restore our connections to a healthy state. Even the harsh judgment I  hold in my heart against my brother or my sister, the open wound that  was never cured, the offense that was never forgiven, the rancor that is only going to hurt me, are all instances of a fight that I carry within  me, a flare deep in my heart that needs to be extinguished before it  goes up in flames, leaving only ashes behind.” Francis’ speech closed with the assertion that “the future of humankind isn’t exclusively in the hands of politicians,  of great leaders, of big companies.” Instead, he said the future rests on those “who recognize the other as a ‘you’ and themselves as part of an ‘us.’ “ Bruno Giussani, TED’s international curator, who convinced the pope to give the talk, told CNN on Wednesday that Francis is perhaps “the only moral voice capable of reaching people across boundaries and providing clarity and a compelling message of hope.” TED2017’s “The Future You” conference ends Friday.

Video: Planned Parenthood exec who ‘wanted a Lamborghini’ caught haggling over baby body parts 
.B
The Center for Medical Progress released a never-before-seen video Wednesday showing a top Planned Parenthood executive haggling over the price of baby body parts from abortions. Mary Gatter, president of the medical directors’ council at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, is the same executive who, in a previous undercover video, was caught saying she wanted to buy a Lamborghini with the profits from fetal tissue. In the new video, when an undercover journalist tells Ms. Gatter he is willing to pay $50 per fetal tissue specimen, she says that’s “on the low end.” “$50 was like 12 years ago,” she says. Ms. Gatter also asks the undercover journalist how much fetal tissue he wants to buy. “What kind of volume do you need and what gestational ages?” she says, adding that specimens are available up to 16 weeks. The video comes as Republicans attempt to redirect Planned Parenthood’s nearly $500 million annual budget toward women’s health clinics that do not perform abortions. “Tell President Trump to hold Planned Parenthood accountable for their illegal sale of baby body parts,” the video ends. David Daleiden, CMP project lead, said taxpayers should stop footing the bill for the abortion giant. “The volume-based sums that Planned Parenthood charged these businesses for baby parts are criminal trafficking and profiteering in fetal body parts,” Mr. Daleiden said in a statement. “The U.S. Department of Justice should take heed of the Congressional investigations’ criminal referrals and prosecute Planned Parenthood to the full extent of the law, and taxpayers must stop being forced to subsidize Planned Parenthood’s criminal abortion empire.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Christian rapper: Church needs to admit it ‘sees through a glass dimly’ on race issues
.B
In order to foster racial reconciliation, the church in America needs to admits it “sees through a glass dimly” on racial issues, rap artist Propaganda — born Jason Emmanuel Petty — said in an interview now airing on Christian streaming network the Dove Channel. “I kind of think we could stand to be a little more honest about our shortcomings, our mistakes, our failures… and be willing to say like the Scripture says, I see through a glass dimly,” Mr. Petty told Christian journalist and Dove Channel “Frankly Faraci” host Matthew Faraci. The attitude Christians should have, he added, is, “I don’t have this figured out. I’m running at the cross just like you are. I am not what I want to be.” In earlier interviews, Mr. Petty has similarly spoken about racial reconciliation in the church and how cultural assumptions and prejudices can cloud Christians from looking clearly at issues related towards biblically-based reconciliation. “Let’s not just go find black things to put into a white structure, let’s look at the structure,” he said in a 2016 interview with Relevant magazine, reported hip-hop website Rapzilla. “I think when you do that as a church and say, ‘How much of our ecclesiology is really just Victorian or Greek rather than truly biblical?’ that that opens the door for the church to really start stepping toward reconciliation.” In his Dove Channel interview, Mr. Petty suggested that regardless of one’s race, the Christian faith teaches that everyone fundamentally has the same problem and needs the same Savior. “I think that if we could as a body just kind of like, just kind of embrace like, what the cross says about us,” Mr. Petty told Dove Channel’s Mr. Faraci, “which is the cross says about us is that you’re hopeless.” “The worst thing anybody can say to you is not worse than what the cross says, which is, you’re hopeless. There’s nothing you can do about you.” In addition to racial reconciliation within the church in America, Mr. Petty explained his philosophy about art and cultural change. “I’m not the artist, I’m the canvas…. The Lord’s the artist… I got to be who I am, I got to be what He made me,” Mr. Petty said, adding that it was a “culture-shaping” perspective. “The fountainhead of culture is like virtue, so if you have virtuous men and women… at the mouth of the river of culture, then downstream, politics, music, and stuff like that, education, all that changes down there,” he added. “My attitude is how can I shape this up here? What can I throw into the river up there that when it gets downstream… I can look back and be like, I may not have any plaques on my wall, but, I tell you what, that’s my plaque: the fact that like this law is now passed or this institution is this, you know, you see what I’m saying.” The Propaganda interview and the entire first season of “Frankly Faraci” can be seen on YouTube as well as the Dove Channel’s app on streaming video via platforms such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.

Bill Nye show bashes Christian views on sexuality using cartoon orgy of ice cream cones
.B
Television host Bill Nye is using his new Netflix series as a vehicle to attack Christian beliefs on sexuality in a peculiar way — cartoon orgies featuring anthropomorphic ice cream cones. “Bill Nye Saves The World” debuted on Netflix April 21 to cheers of fans who watched PBS’s “Bill Nye the Science Guy” as children. Each episode of Mr. Nye’s new project seeks to “explore scientific issues that touch our lives,” but one in particular covered the “different flavors of sexuality.” A cartoon character named “Vanilla” preaches on the virtues of purity before a slew of other flavors — male and female — attempt to seduce him with suggestive dialogue and behavior. “Come on, Vanilla. Nobody wants just one flavor of ice cream. Haven’t you ever wanted to be in a neapolitan?” says one character. “Come on. It’s natural. All-natural cocoa,” says another. “And strawberry fresh from the field. And so creamy and delicious. Mmm,” says a male ice-cream cone. “Big ice cream in the sky, help me,” Vanilla prays before licking a male character. “This is on! Oh, yes!” the group cheers in conjunction with a montage of ice cream cones licking each other. “That was cool, wasn’t it?” Mr. Nye said as the clip ended and his studio audience cheered.

Abortion question opens rift among Democrats over direction of party
.B
Some higher-ups in the Democratic Party are taking a softer tone on abortion in a bid to win back the blue-collar voters who spurned Hillary Clinton at the ballot box, revealing a schism between the economic populists and cultural liberals over the direction of the party. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said there is an “enormous disconnect” between rank-and-file Democrats — one-quarter to one-third of whom identify as pro-life — and party leadership, to whom abortion is sacrosanct. “As they push their party more and more to the extreme on abortion, the GOP benefits at the polls,” Ms. Dannenfelser said in a statement. The pro-choice wing of the party made considerable gains during the Obama years, amending the party platform to endorse taxpayer funding for abortion and dropping the last term in the “safe, legal and rare” triumvirate that became the Democratic line on abortion during Bill Clinton’s presidency. But that leftward tilt began to show signs of reversing last week. Asked Sunday whether there is room in the party for people who are pro-life, the staunchly pro-choice House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi responded, “Of course.” “I have served many years in Congress with members who have not shared my very positive — my family would say ‘aggressive’ — position on promoting a woman’s right to choose,” the California Democrat said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The catalyst for rethinking the party line on abortion came in an unlikely place — the Omaha, Nebraska, mayoral race — and, ironically, during a “Come Together and Fight Back” tour spearheaded by someone who isn’t even a Democrat. Democrats nominated Heath Mello, a pro-life Catholic, to try to unseat Mayor Jean Stothert, a Republican. Mr. Mello, a former Nebraska lawmaker, co-sponsored the state’s 20-week abortion ban and other pro-life legislation and has come under fire from abortion advocates who say he doesn’t represent the party’s values. “If Democrats think the path forward following the 2016 election is to support candidates who substitute their own judgment and ideology for that of their female constituents, they have learned all the wrong lessons and are bound to lose,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement. Mr. Mello later clarified his stance on the question of abortion, telling The Huffington Post that he is personally pro-life but “would never do anything to restrict access to reproductive health care” as mayor. Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, went to Omaha to campaign for Mr. Mello last week as part of the unity tour and defended his decision to do so. “We have a Republican president who ran as a candidate as the most unpopular candidate in modern history in this country,” Mr. Sanders said Sunday on CBS’ “This Week.” “Republicans control the House, Senate, two-thirds of governors’ chairs, and in the last eight years, they have picked up 900 legislative seats. Clearly, the Democratic Party has got to change.” A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday supports Mr. Sanders’ conjecture that the party’s message is falling flat. In the survey, 67 percent of respondents said the Democratic Party is “out of touch with the concerns of most people,” though 62 percent said the same of the Republican Party and 58 percent of President Trump. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said it’s the “cultural issues that have disconnected Democrats from a lot of Middle America.” “I have been asking all Democratic leaders that come on here, ‘Would you be OK with a pro-life person if they were from Alabama or from Kentucky? And if they’re from Alabama and they agree with you on economics, is it OK if they’re pro-life?’” Mr. Scarborough said last week on “Morning Joe.” “And I keep hearing, ‘No. No it’s not. No it’s not. No it’s not,” he said. Mr. Trump rode a wave of Catholic support on his way to the White House, carrying the demographic by 52 percent to 45 percent. Jay Richards, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, said the question of abortion is a nonstarter for many Catholics, who might otherwise support Democrats because of their stances on economics, immigration and the environment. “Abortion for Catholics is not just one of a bunch of issues; it’s considered an intrinsic moral evil,” Mr. Richards said. “It’s not something on which faithful Catholics can legitimately disagree, and that makes it different from every other issue that we have debates between Republicans and Democrats on.” Despite stumping for a pro-life mayoral candidate, Mr. Sanders endorsed but declined to campaign for Georgia congressional candidate Jon Ossoff, who is pro-choice and publicly questioned the candidate’s progressive bona fides on economic issues. While Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez initially threw his support behind Mr. Mello, he issued a stern statement after the politician’s pro-life views came to light, even saying that “pro-choice” is now an official party litmus test. “I fundamentally disagree with Heath Mello’s personal beliefs about women’s reproductive health,” Mr. Perez said in the statement. “It is a promising step that Mello now shares the Democratic Party’s position on women’s fundamental rights. “Every candidate who runs as a Democrat should do the same because every woman should be able to make her own health choices. Period,” he said. Other Democrats have also come out against the idea that the party has room for people with pro-life views. Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said the party is open to people who are personally pro-life but not those who are willing to impose that view on others. “We need to be understanding of those who take a different position because of personal conscience,” Mr. Durbin said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But as long as they are prepared to back the law, Roe v. Wade, prepared to back women’s rights as we define them under the law, then I think they can be part of the party.” As a result, Mr. Richards said, he doesn’t foresee “a genuine reconsideration of the actual Democratic Party policy” when it comes to abortion. “This is a rhetorical game,” he said. “It’s not any kind of intellectual shift. I really don’t think that’s going on.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.  Click here for reprint permission. Click to Read More Click to Hide

Education Secretary DeVos says Common Core no longer an issue for schools
.B
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said Monday that Common Core isn’t an issue states have to deal with anymore. “There’s isn’t really any Common Core anymore, and each state is able to set the standards for their state,” Ms. DeVos said on Fox News. Instead, the department is focusing on the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was passed in December 2015 but is still in the process of being implemented. It replaces the No Child Left Behind Act, but gives states more authority in how to rate and address schools’ performance. It also prohibits the department from influencing states to adopt Common Core, a set of educational standards all 50 states could opt into with the  possibility of receiving federal grants depending on their performance. “The Every Student Succeeds Act, which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,” Ms. DeVos said. Common Core was widely unpopular among conservative groups who claimed it gave more power to the federal government without addressing the major issues of education.

Pope to canonize Fatima visionaries
.B
Vatican City - During his trip to Portugal for the centenary of the Fatima Marian apparitions next month, Pope Francis will canonize visionaries Francisco and Jacinta Marto, making them the youngest non-martyrs to ever be declared saints. The children will be canonized during Pope Francis’ May 13 Mass in Fatima. The decision for the date was made during a April 20 consistory of cardinals, which also voted on the dates of four other canonizations, in addition to that of Francisco and Jacinta, that will take place this year. Some martyrs who will soon be saints are diocesan priests Andrea de Soveral and Ambrogio Francesco Ferro, and layman Matteo Moreira, killed in hatred of the faith in Brazil in 1645; and three teenagers – Cristóbal, Antonio, and Juan – killed in hatred of the faith in Mexico in 1529, who will be canonized October 15. Bl. Angelo da Acri, a Capuchin priest who died in October 1739, and Faustino Míguez, a Piarist priest who founded the Calasanziano Institute of the Daughters of the Divine Shepherd, will also be canonized October 15. Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, the Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, is the man who was largely responsible for advancing the visionaries’ cause, paving the way for them to become the first canonized children who were not martyred. Previously, the Portuguese cardinal told CNA, children were not beatified, due to the belief “that children didn’t yet have the ability to practice Christian heroic virtue like adults.” But that all changed when the cause for Francisco and Jacinta Marto arrived on his desk. Francisco, 11, and Jacinta, 10, became the youngest non-martyr children in the history of the Church to be beatified when on May 13, 2000, the 83rd anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady at Fatima, Pope John Paul II proclaimed them “Blessed,” officially showing that young children can become Saints. The brother and sister, who tended to their family’s sheep with their cousin Lucia Santo in the fields of Fatima, Portugal, witnessed the apparitions of Mary now commonly known as Our Lady of Fatima. During the first apparition, which took place May 13, 1917, Our Lady asked the three children to pray the Rosary and make sacrifices for the conversion of sinners. The children did this and were known to pray often, giving their lunch to beggars and going without food themselves. They offered up their sacrifices and even refrained from drinking water on hot days. When Francisco and Jacinta became seriously ill with the Spanish flu in October 1918, Mary appeared to them and said she would to take them to heaven soon. Bed-ridden, Francisco requested and received his first Communion. The following day, Francisco died, April 4, 1919. Jacinta suffered a long illness and was eventually transferred to a Lisbon hospital, where she underwent an operation for an abscess in her chest. However, her health did not improve and she died Feb. 20, 1920. Francisco and Jacinta “practiced Christian virtue in a heroic way,” Cardinal Martins said, explaining that among other things, one of the most obvious moments in which this virtue was apparent for him was when the three shepherd children were arrested and intimidated by their mayor on August 13, 1917. Government stability in Portugal was rocky following the revolution and coup d’état that led to the overthrow of the monarchy and subsequent establishment of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910. A new liberal constitution separating Church and state was drafted under the influence of Freemasonry, which sought to omit the faith – which for many was the backbone of Portuguese culture and society – from public life. It was in this context that, after catching wind of the Virgin Mary’s appearance to Francisco, Jacinta and Lucia, district Mayor Artur de Oliveira Santos had the children arrested on the day Mary was to appear to them, and threatened to boil them in hot oil unless they would confess to inventing the apparitions. At one point in the conversation at the jailhouse, Jacinta was taken out of the room, leaving Francisco and Lucia alone. The two were told that Jacinta had been burned with hot oil, and that if they didn’t lie, the same would happen to them. However, instead of caving to the pressure, the children said: “you can do whatever you want, but we cannot tell a lie. Do whatever you want to us, burn us with oil, but we cannot tell a lie.” “This was the virtue of these children,” Cardinal Martins said, noting that to accept death rather than tell a lie is “more heroic than many adults.” “There’s a lot to say on the heroicness of children,” he said, adding that “because of this I brought their cause forward.” Cardinal Martins was also the one to bring Lucia’s cause to the Vatican following her death in 2005. The visionary had spent the remainder of her life after the apparitions as a Carmelite nun. Typically, there must be a five-year waiting period after a person dies before their cause can be brought forward. However, after only three years Martins ask that the remaining two be dismissed, and his request was granted. Although the diocesan phase of the cause has already been finished, Cardinal Martins – who knew the visionary personally – said Lucia’s process will take much longer than that of Francisco and Jacinta not only due to her long life, but also because of the vast number of letters and other material from her writings and correspondence that needs to be examined. The cardinal, who will be present in Fatima with the Pope during his May 12-13 visit for the centenary of the apparitions, said he views the occasion as the conclusion of a process that began with him changing a norm regarding the view of children “and their heroic virtue.” This process is important, he said, because it means there could be other children who practiced heroic virtue that can now be canonized, so “it’s certainly something important.” “It needs to be seen that (children) are truly capable of practicing heroic virtue,” not only in Fatima, but “in the Christian life,” he said. Although canonizations, apart from a few exceptions, are typically held in Rome, it was only recently that beatifications began to be held outside of Rome, in the local Church which promoted the new Blessed’s cause. This change was made by Cardinal Martins in September 2005, after receiving the approval of Benedict XVI. In the past, a beatification Mass in Rome would be presided over by the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints during the morning, with the Pope coming down to the basilica to pray to the new Blessed in the afternoon. Cardinal Martins said he decided to change this because the beatification and the canonization “are two different realities.” “While the canonizations had a more universal dimension of the Church, the beatifications have a more local dimension, where they (the Blessed) came from,” he said, noting that this is reflected even in the words spoken during the rites for each Mass. “Because of this, I made a distinction: the beatification in their (the Blessed’s) own church, in their diocese, and the canonizations in Rome.” The result was “a fantastic revolution,” he said, explaining that while maybe 2-3,000 people would participate in the beatification ceremonies in Rome, hundreds of thousands started to come for the local beatification Masses of new Blessed in their home dioceses. The cardinal said that “it’s beautiful” to see people – many times including friends and family members of new Blessed – join in honoring their countryman, asking for their intercession, and seeking to follow their example. He believes the custom will remain like this, adding that it is beautiful particularly from the standpoint of evangelization. “The new Blessed says to their brothers, many of whom they knew, ‘I am one of you, one like you, so you must follow my path and live the Gospel in depth’,” the cardinal said, explaining that this is “a formidable act of evangelization, and with everyone happy about the new Blessed, they’ll immediately do what they say!” Cardinal Martins said the decision was also prompted by the emphasis placed on local Churches during the Second Vatican Council. “I thought, one of the most effective ways to highlight the importance of local Churches is to conduct in the local diocese the beatification of one of their sons,” he said.

Seasonal allergies: Nip them in the bud
.B
ANALYSIS/OPINION With spring temperatures warming up, you may find yourself among the estimated 50 million people throughout our nation afflicted with puffy, itchy eyes; a scratchy throat; sneezing and coughing; or even shortness of breath. Reports are that local hospitals, clinics and doctor’s offices are seeing high volumes of people suffering from allergies this season. And those with asthma may find seasonal allergies are making their condition harder to control. Also, if you think you are immune to allergies but have noticed some of these symptoms, understand this: Allergies can begin at any point in your life. During this time of the year, major allergy triggers are often related to tree and flower pollination that occurs in the spring. These pollens are often lightweight and can travel significant distances, often ending up in people’s noses and mouths.And as much as we enjoy the charms of spring, seasonal allergies — also called hay fever and allergic rhinitis — can make you feel miserable. Add to this, allergies can affect your quality of your life—sinus infections, disrupting sleep, and ability to perform well on projects at work or in school. While there is no known cure for allergies, they can be managed through prevention and treatment. So, if you are  – or someone you love is — battling allergies, here are some tips to help alleviate symptoms and manage seasonal allergies.Dr. Nina’s What You Need To Know: About Allergy Season and How to Manage It:What is pollen? The fertilizing element of flowering trees, grass and weeds. Because pollen is lightweight, wind readily carries it over large distances. Unfortunately for seasonal allergy sufferers, this also facilitates its ability to land on our nostrils and enter our lungs.And while we are most cognizant of the yellow pollen that collects on our cars, it is often the ones that are not visible to the human eye, that bring on misery to allergy sufferers. Depending on where you live there are generally three pollen seasons –  in the spring, trees and flowers; in the summer, grasses; and in the fall, leaves, weeds (and molds).How does pollen cause allergy symptoms? For some of us, our body sees pollen as a foreign invader. And, as a result, it mounts a fierce, take-no-prisoners attack by releasing chemicals such as histamine or leukotrienes. These fancy - and hard to pronounce and spell - chemicals work diligently to remove the foreign invader by making us sneeze, our nose run, our eyes water, and cough. And although this is a clever disposal system, it can be agonizing. What other problems can allergies cause? While the symptoms can cause misery, seasonal allergies can also create a plethora of other health problems:    •    Sleep deprivation can result from nasal congestion or coughing that keeps us from falling asleep or wakes us up at night. This can lead to daytime drowsiness and its associated problems—difficulty concentrating, grouchiness, and headaches, to name a few.       •    Asthmatics can experience an exacerbation of their otherwise well-managed symptoms.  because pollen is an asthma trigger.      •    Chronic sinusitis—seasonal allergies can cause chronic inflammation of the nasal passages along with mucus production that results in obstruction and subsequent bacterial obstruction      •    There is also some research that suggests seasonal allergies can contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome and depression (possibly from sleep deprivation or triggered by inflammatory reactions in the body).  Also, it is surprisingly difficult to differentiate between a cold and allergies—they share similar symptoms—tired, itchy, runny nose, sneezing. This is particularly the case around this time of year, when the “illness” is just getting started.     •    Allergies don’t cause a fever. If temperature is elevated, it is a good sign you have a cold.     •    Length of time—allergy symptoms last weeks or months if left untreated, but a cold     clears up in a week.Seasonal Allergies and Asthma: Allergy Symptoms Could Trigger Asthma AttacksAllergies do not automatically cause people to develop asthma. What are some tips to survive allergy season?If you know you suffer with seasonal allergies, start to protect yourself early on – if you have not already, take action now (before your eyes start watering and you start sneezing). And take these steps to help with relief:Reduce your exposure to triggers:    •    Block pollen from making contact with your hair and eyes by wearing a large-brim hat or cap and large sunglasses when outdoors      •    Minimize time spent outdoors when pollen counts are high—this typically runs midday to afternoon—and, too, when it is windyKeep pollen out of the home:    •    Upon entering the home, make sure to change your clothes and take a shower immediately. And, park your shoes at the door.    •    Use air-conditioning in the house or car     •    Close windows at night or when the pollen count is high    •    Wash bedding in hot water at least once a week     •    Change air filters and choose high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. They are specially designed to trap pollen and dust and can provide much needed relief from pollen in the house    •    Wipe down our beloved furry friends (pets) before they enter the house What are some effective home remedies?    •    Inhaling steam through our nose is a simple method to refresh and soothe irritated sinuses and help rid the nasal passages of mucus. After boiling several cups of water, pour them into a big bowl, lean over the bowl, and drape a towel over your head. Then, breathe gently for 5 to 10 minutes.    •    Saline sprays are a simple and effective method to flush pollen out of our nasal passages, thin and clear mucus, and combat the drying effects of prescription allergy medications. They are available at most pharmacies and can also be made by mixing a teaspoon of salt into 1 quart of distilled or boiled water and using a baby aspirator to administer it once the water cools.    •    Neti pots are typically made of ceramic or plastic and can best be described as a cross between a small teapot and Aladdin’s magic lamp. They use a mechanism similar to saline sprays—the nasal cavities are rinsed with a saline solution to flush pollen out and soften mucus. The difference is that instead of squeezing a bottle, the “snout” of the pot delivers the solution.What are some over-the-counter medications? • Antihistamines relieve sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes and nose. Examples: diphenhydramine, loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine.  • Decongestants alleviate nasal stuffiness by shrinking the lining of nasal passages. Examples: pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, and oxymetazolineWhat are some prescription medications?• Nasal corticosteroids are an effective way to decrease all seasonal allergy symptoms by blocking allergic reactions and decreasing inflammation. And because it is directly administered into the nostrils, they tend to have the fewest side effects.  • Leukotriene receptor antagonists inhibit the action of leukotrienes, which send signals to the body to mount an attack against pollen.  • Immunotherapy introduces the allergen in small amounts to the body to boost tolerance to pollen and blunt the body’s allergic response. It is available as allergy shots or sublingual tablets.  Always check with your pharmacist before starting any new medication – and always discuss all other medications you are taking prior to starting any new medications. Follow instructions on the label. And if you are not getting relief – DO NOT take more medication than recommended in an attempt to lessen your symptoms, but DO call your primary physician to determine which treatment is best for your symptoms.This season, be proactive about your allergies. Educate yourself about your triggers, seek your primary physicians help —  and ensure you have an effective treatment to provide symptom relief. Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Harvard tells students gender identity can change ‘day to day’: Report
.B
A Harvard University office devoted to LGBT issues reportedly has issued a flier telling students that gender identity can change as frequently as “day to day.” The flier from the Ivy League schools BGLTQ Student Life office, headlined “Get the facts about gender diversity,” informs readers that “Sex assigned at birth and gender identity are not necessarily the same,” Campus Reform reported Thursday. The flyer adds that “gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, hormonal makeup, physical anatomy, and/or how one is perceived in daily life.” The document also seems to categorize speech that challenges or disagrees with transgenderism as “violence.” “Transphobic misinformation is a form of systemic violence,” read the document, which included examples of the alleged verbal violence: “Fixed binaries and biological essentialism, manifest in gendered language, misgendering someone, and the policing of trans bodies, threaten the lives of trans people.” The reference to “fixed binaries” appears to have in view the notion that a person’s gender identity is dependent on an unalterable binary — male or female — scheme. According to the Oxford Reference website, “biological essentialism” is “The belief that ‘human nature’, an individual’s personality, or some specific quality (such as intelligence, creativity, homosexuality, masculinity, femininity, or a male propensity to aggression) is an innate and natural ‘essence’ (rather than a product of circumstances, upbringing, and culture).” It’s unclear the weight the new flyer has in terms of regulating student conduct, but Harvard, a private institution not held to the higher free speech standards of state-owned institutions, has language in its student-conduct policies which permit disciplining students for offensive speech related to gender identity. “Behavior evidently intended to dishonor such characteristics as race, gender, ethnic group, religious belief, or sexual orientation is contrary to the pursuit of inquiry and education,” reads a Harvard statement on freedom of speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a libertarian academic watchdog. “Such grave disrespect for the dignity of others can be punished under existing procedures because it violates a balance of rights on which the University is based,” the Harvard statement said.

Pence praises Indonesia’s democratic, tolerant values
.B
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — U.S. Vice President Mike Pence praised Indonesia’s democracy and moderate form of Islam on Thursday alongside the president of the world’s most populous Muslim nation, reinforcing his message with a visit to the region’s largest mosque. Pence’s comments, though routine, had significance for Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who a day earlier suffered a serious political setback when a political ally was defeated by Islamic conservatives in the election for Jakarta governor. The divisive campaign undermined the image of Indonesia abroad as a generally tolerant Muslim nation. Indonesia is the latest stop on an Asian tour by Pence that aims to reaffirm traditional U.S. alliances at a time when Donald Trump’s presidency has raised questions about the strength of the U.S. commitment to the region. Pence said at a joint news conference with Jokowi that the U.S. wants to strengthen its strategic partnership with Indonesia. In brief comments, Jokowi said they agreed to boost cooperation. The vice president praised Indonesia for its moderate form of Islam and said the two countries would continue to cooperate on combating terrorism. “As the second- and third-largest democracies in the world, our two countries share many common values including freedom, the rule of law, human rights and religious diversity,” Pence said. “The United States is proud to partner with Indonesia. It promotes and protects these values.” The vice president added: “Indonesia’s tradition of moderate Islam frankly is an inspiration to the world and we commend you and your people. In your nation as in mine, religion unifies, it doesn’t divide.” But Pence foreshadowed some reworking of commercial and economic ties, saying that the U.S. seeks a free and fair relationship that helps job creation and economic growth for both sides. He said that U.S. exporters should face a level playing field and the relationship should be “win-win.” Trump assailed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal during his 2016 campaign and announced shortly after his inauguration that the U.S. would withdraw from the Pacific Rim-based TPP, which now includes 11 countries from Chile to New Zealand. Pence has sought to reassure allies in the region that the U.S. is still committed to trade and economic ties despite Trump’s decision on TPP. Indonesia is on Trump’s trade hit list of nations that he considers the U.S. is losing out to in trade, and U.S. company Freeport-McMoran Inc., which operates the world’s largest copper mine in the Indonesian province of Papua, is in a protracted dispute with the Indonesian government. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, is active in Indonesia with plans to manage luxury resorts being built near the capital Jakarta and on the tourist island of Bali. Trump’s Indonesian business partner, billionaire Hary Tanoe, is an aspiring politician who has said he might run for president in 2019. Pence’s first engagement in Indonesia was morning tea with Jokowi at the presidential palace. He and his family later visited the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia. The Pences removed their shoes at the entrance and his wife, Karen, and two daughters covered their heads with scarves. They walked inside the large prayer hall, observing the soaring dome, and also stopped at an open terrace in the mosque. Pence later sat with several faith leaders in a conference room where a speaker gave Pence an overview of the mosque’s history. The mosque, which can accommodate up to 200,000 people, was designed by a Protestant and sits near a Catholic cathedral in central Jakarta. The message and images sought to address questions in the Muslim world about Trump after his push for travel bans that would temporarily suspend visas from six predominantly-Muslim countries and halt the U.S. refugee program. Two judges have blocked the ban, prompting the Trump administration to appeal. Trump’s executive order does not include Indonesia, but the country is home to nearly 14,000 refugees seeking resettlement in third countries and activists have said the ban would affect their ability of entering the U.S. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Wright contributed to this report.

American adoptions of foreign children still declining
.B
NEW YORK – The number of foreign children adopted by U.S. parents dropped almost 5 percent last year, continuing a steady decline that’s now extended for 12 years, according to new State Department figures. However, department officials said they have been working closely with numerous countries to strengthen international adoption procedures, and they suggested the numbers could rise if the U.S. adoption community helped to address some of those countries’ concerns about ethics and oversight. The department’s report for the 2016 fiscal year, released on Thursday, shows 5,372 adoptions from abroad, down from 5,648 in 2015 and more than 76 percent below the high of 22,884 in 2004. The number has fallen every year since then. China, as is customary, accounted for the most children adopted in the U.S. Its total of 2,231 was down slightly from 2015 and far below a peak of 7,903 in 2005. Congo was second on the list with 359 adoptions. Many of those were adoptions that had been delayed for several years during a suspension – now lifted – that the Congo government imposed out of concerns over adoption fraud.Ukraine was third on the list with 303 adoptions, followed by South Korea, Bulgaria, India, Uganda, Ethiopia, Haiti and the Philippines. As adoptions from various countries have declined in recent years, adoption advocates – and the State Department – have cited Africa as an area where adoptions may increase. However, Susan Jacobs, the department’s special adviser for children’s issues, said this can present unique challenges because some African birth parents may incorrectly believe that adopted children would return home to care for them after living abroad temporarily to get a good education. For a second straight year, there were no adoptions from Russia, which once accounted for hundreds of U.S. adoptions each year, but imposed a ban that fully took effect in 2014. The ban served as retaliation for a U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human-rights violators. The last time there were fewer foreign adoptions to the U.S. overall was in 1981, when, according to U.S. immigration figures, there were 4,868 adoptions from abroad. The State Department, in its new report, said it had identified three concerns that were causing some foreign countries to be wary of international adoption:–Illegal or unethical practices by some U.S. adoption agencies or adoption facilitators operating abroad. One Ohio-based agency was recently barred by the State Department from engaging in international adoption for three years because of extensive improprieties.–Lack of comprehensive, nationwide laws that prevent adoptive parents from transferring custody of adopted children to another family without official authorization. This practice, known as re-homing, has often involved children adopted from abroad who prove more challenging to raise than the adoptive family had anticipated.–The failure of some U.S. families to complete required post-adoption reports. Trish Maskew, chief of the State Department’s adoption division, said Kazakhstan and Guatemala were potentially interested in resuming long-suspended international adoptions to the U.S., but only if several hundred overdue reports were completed by parents who adopted children from those countries in past years. Chuck Johnson, CEO of the National Council of Adoption and a critic of State Department adoption policy, acknowledged that lapses related to all three issues were “a black-eye on adoption.” However, he said the State Department should have been providing more leadership in addressing the problems. “These negative results are not the experiences of the great majority of internationally adopted children nor of their adoptive families; neither are the actions of a few providers indicative of the majority of accredited U.S. adoption providers,” Johnson said in an email. Adoption officials in the State Department “have a history of either personally opposing intercountry adoption outright or endorsing it in lukewarm fashion,” Johnson wrote. As long as the department “is allowed to continue down this path, children suffer and die.” Susan Jacobs urged the department’s critics in the adoption community to consider what steps they could take to ensure that international adoption is ethical and transparent. “We are committed to intercountry adoption. We want this to be available in every country in the world,” said Jacobs. “But we can’t do this without the cooperation of everybody involved in the process. We want this to be a practice that everyone can be proud of.” Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More Click to Hide
